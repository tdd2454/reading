Today there are no shocks, and the rat has acquired another truth that takes precedence—“but not today.” The first truth is still there; as proof, start coupling tone with shock again, and freezing to tone is “reinstated” faster than the association was initially learned. Where is “but not today” consolidated? In the PFC, after receiving information from the hippocampus.67 The medial PFC activates inhibitory circuits in the BLA, and the rat stops freezing to the tone.",
