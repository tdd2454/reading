* Naturally, by now Bowlby’s offspring, the school of “attachment parenting,” is so established as to have generated endless
misconceptions, fads, cults, lunatic fringes, and crazy-making senses of neurotic inadequacy or self-righteous superiority
among parents. To open a can of worms a smidgen, there is no scientific support for concluding that a woman has irreparably
damaged her child if she does not breast-feed, breast-feeds for less than the first decade of the child’s life, can’t successfully
breast-feed her child within seconds after birth, or ever leaves the child alone for more than two seconds, let alone works
outside of the house. And nothing about the science says that the same good effects of attachment can’t be provided by a
man, a working single mother, two mommies, or two daddies.
