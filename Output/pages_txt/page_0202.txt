A KEY QUESTION
W
e’ve now examined adult consequences of childhood adversity
and their biological mediators. A key question persists. Yes,
childhood abuse increases the odds of being an abusive adult; witnessing
violence raises the risk for PTSD; loss of a parent to death means more
chance of adult depression. Nevertheless, many, maybe even most
victims of such adversity turn into reasonably functional adults. There is
a shadow over childhood, demons lurk in corners of the mind, but overall
things are okay. What explains such resilience?
As we’ll see, genes and fetal environment are relevant. But most
important, recall the logic of collapsing different types of trauma into a
single category. What counts is the sheer number of times a child is
bludgeoned by life and the number of protective factors. Be sexually
abused as a child, or witness violence, and your adult prognosis is better
than if you had experienced both. Experience childhood poverty, and
your future prospects are better if your family is stable and loving than
broken and acrimonious. Pretty straightforwardly, the more categories of
adversities a child suffers, the dimmer his or her chances of a happy,
functional adulthood.45
