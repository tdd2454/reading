or how you think about monkeys and bananas or the physics of a ball’s
trajectory. Culture’s impact is enormous.
Naturally, there are various caveats concerning
collectivist/individualist comparisons:
The most obvious is the perpetual “on the average”—
there are plenty of Westerners, for example, who are
more collectivist than plenty of East Asians. In general,
people who are most individualist by various personality
measures are most individualist in neuroimaging
studies.17
Cultures change over time. For example, levels of
conformity in East Asian cultures are declining (one
study, for example, shows increased rates of babies in
Japan receiving unique names). Moreover, one’s degree
of inculcation into one’s culture can be altered rapidly.
For example, priming someone beforehand with
individualist or collectivist cultural cues shifts how
holistically he processes a picture. This is especially true
for bicultural individuals.18
We will soon see about some genetic differences
between collectivist and individualist populations. There
is nothing resembling genetic destiny about this—the
best evidence for this conclusion comes from one of the
control groups in many of these studies, namely East
Asian Americans. In general, it takes about a generation
for the descendants of East Asian immigrants to
America to be as individualist as European Americans.19
Obviously, “East Asians” and “Westerners” are not
monolithic entities. Just ask someone from Beijing
versus the Tibetan steppes. Or stick three people from
Berkeley, Brooklyn, and Biloxi in a stalled elevator for a
few hours and see what happens. As we will see, there is
striking variation within cultures.
Why should people in one part of the globe have developed
collectivist cultures, while others went individualist? The United States
is the individualism poster child for at least two reasons. First there’s
