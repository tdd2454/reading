* This test is reminiscent of something called the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). My wife, who spent her
professional youth as a neuropsychologist, would practice tests on me when she was in grad school; the CVLT was, without
question, the worst. It was insanely stressful—I’d be a sopping mess by the time she’d finally call it an evening. But on the
other hand, this will pay off handsomely in a few decades when I ace the neuropsych tests out of habit, despite being
seriously demented . . . and thus don’t get appropriate medical care. Hmm, I may need to rethink this.
