just do whichever reconstructive surgery was more convenient.*65
So here’s Goy reporting that prenatal hormone environment, not
social factors, determines adult sex-typical behaviors. “But these are
guinea pigs” was the retort. Goy and crew then studied nonhuman
primates.
A quick tour of sexually dimorphic (i.e., differing by sex) primate
behavior: South American species such as marmosets and tamarins, who
form pair-bonds, show few sex differences in behavior. In contrast, most
Old World primates are highly dimorphic; males are more aggressive,
and females spend more time at affiliative behaviors (e.g., social
grooming, interacting with infants). How’s this for a sex difference: in
one study, adult male rhesus monkeys were far more interested in
playing with “masculine” human toys (e.g., wheeled toys) than
“feminine” ones (stuffed animals), while females had a slight preference
for feminine.66
What next, female monkeys prefer young-adult fantasy novels with
female protagonists? Why should human toys be relevant to sex
differences in monkeys? The authors speculate that this reflects the
higher activity levels in males, and how masculine toys facilitate more
active play.
