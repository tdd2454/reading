Five
Days to Months Before
O
ur act has occurred—the pulling of a trigger or the touching of an
arm that can mean such different things in different contexts.
Why did that just happen? We’ve seen how, seconds before, that
behavior was the product of the nervous system, whose actions were
shaped by sensory cues minutes to hours before, and how the brain’s
sensitivity to those cues was shaped by hormonal exposure in the
preceding hours to days. What events in the prior days to months shaped
that outcome?
Chapter 2 introduced the plasticity of neurons, the fact that things
alter in them. The strength of a dendritic input, the axon hillock’s set
point for initiating an action potential, the duration of the refractory
period. The previous chapter showed that, for example, testosterone
increases the excitability of amygdaloid neurons, and glucocorticoids
decrease excitability of prefrontal cortical neurons. We even saw how
progesterone boosts the efficacy with which GABA-ergic neurons
decrease the excitability of other neurons.
Those versions of neural plasticity occur over hours. We now
examine more dramatic plasticity occurring over days to months. A few
months is enough time for an Arab Spring, for a discontented winter, or
for STDs to spread a lot during a Summer of Love. As we’ll see, this is
also sufficient time for enormous changes in the brain’s structure.
