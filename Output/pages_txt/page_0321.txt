someone moves to another group), and nomadicism as a safety valve
preventing intergroup violence (i.e., rather than warring with the
neighboring band, just hunt in a different valley from them).
The standard-bearers for HG grooviness were the Kalahari !Kung.*71
The title of an early monograph about them—Elizabeth Marshall
Thomas’s 1959 The Harmless People—says it all.* !Kung are to the
Yanomamö as Joan Baez is to Sid Vicious and the Sex Pistols.
Naturally, this picture of the !Kung in particular and HGs in general
was ripe for revisionism. This occurred when field studies were
sufficiently long term to document HGs killing one another, as
summarized in an influential 1978 publication by Carol Ember of Yale.72
Basically, if you’re observing a band of thirty people, it will take a long
time to see that, on a per-capita basis, they have murder rates
approximating Detroit’s (the standard comparison always made).
Admitting that HGs were violent was seen as a purging of sixties
anthropological romanticism, a bracing slap in the face for
anthropologists who had jettisoned objectivity in order to dance with
wolves.
By the time of Pinker’s synthesis, HG violence was established, and
the percentage of their deaths attributed to warfare averaged around 15
percent, way more than in modern Western societies. Contemporary HG
violence constitutes a big vote for the Hobbesian view of warfare and
violence permeating all of human history.
