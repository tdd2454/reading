unusual punishment. Then in 2012’s Miller v. Alabama, in another 5–4
split, the Court banned mandatory life sentences without the chance of
parole for juvenile offenders, on similar grounds.31
The Court’s reasoning was straight out of this chapter. Writing for the
majority in Roper v. Simmons, Justice Anthony Kennedy said:
First, [as everyone knows, a] lack of maturity and an
underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more
often than in adults and are more understandable among the
young. These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-
considered actions and decisions.32
I fully agree with these rulings. But, to show my hand early, I think
this is just window dressing. As will be covered in the screed that
constitutes chapter 16, I think the science encapsulated in this book
should transform every nook and cranny of the criminal justice system.
