It’s a homogeneous field of cells, all organized in roughly the same
way. The top left corner and bottom left corner look exactly the same.
This is a liver in cross-section; if you’ve seen one part, you’ve seen it
all. Boring.
If the brain were this homogeneous and boring, it would be an
undifferentiated mass of tissue, with neuronal cell bodies carpeted evenly
all over the place, sending out their processes every which way. Instead
there’s a huge amount of internal organization:
In other words, the cell bodies of neurons that have related functions
are clumped together in particular regions of the brain, and the axons that
they send to other parts of the brain are organized into projection cables.
What all this means, crucially, is that different parts of the brain do
different things. All the regions of the brain have names (usually
multisyllabic and derived from Greek or Latin), as do the subregions,
and the sub-subregions. Moreover, each talks to a consistent collection of
other regions (i.e., sends axons to them) and is talked to by a consistent
collection (i.e., receives axonal projections from them).
You can go crazy studying all this, as I’ve seen, tragically, in the case
of many a neuroanatomist who relishes all these details. For our purposes
there are some key points:
Each particular region contains millions of neurons.
Some familiar names at this level of analysis:
hypothalamus, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus.
