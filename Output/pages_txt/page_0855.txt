* As an important point, throughout this book, whenever I describe work done by Jane Doe or Joe Smith, I actually mean
“work done by Doe and a team of her postdocs, technicians, grad students, and collaborators spread far and wide over the
years.” I’ll be referring solely to Doe or Smith for brevity, not to imply that they did all the work on their own—science is
utterly a team process. In addition, as long as we’re at it, another point: At endless junctures throughout the book, I’ll be
reporting the results of a study, along the lines of, “And when you do whatever to this or that brain
region/neurotransmitter/hormone/gene/etc., X happens.” What I mean is that on the average X happens, and at a statistically
reliable rate. There is always lots of variability, including individuals in whom nothing happens or even the opposite of X
occurs.
