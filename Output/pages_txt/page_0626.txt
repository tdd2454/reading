White House oversaw the carpet bombing of North Vietnam for
Christmas.*15 This ranges from religious wars, which are, to cite a quote
generally attributed to Napoleon, “people killing each other over who
has the better imaginary friend,” to secular ones where, nevertheless,
omniscient support is requested and proclaimed. Religion is a
particularly tenacious catalyst of violence. Catholics and Protestants
have been killing each other in Europe for nearly 500 years, Shiites and
Sunnis for 1,300. Violent disagreements about differing economic or
governmental models never last as long—this would be like people still
killing each other today over, say, Eastern Roman Emperor Heraclius’s
610 decision to switch the official language from Latin to Greek. As
shown in a study of six hundred terrorist groups spanning forty years,
religiously based terrorism persists the longest and is least likely to
subside due to fighters joining the political process.
Religious primes foster out-group hostility. In a “field study” where
people were surveyed in different locations in a cosmopolitan European
city, merely walking past a church made Christians express more
conservative, negative attitudes toward non-Christians. Another study
examined the priming effects of a violent god. Subjects read a Bible
passage in which a woman is murdered by a mob from another tribe. Her
husband consults with his tribesmen and forms an army that takes
revenge by attacking the other tribe (in biblical fashion, destroying their
cities and killing every human and animal). Half the subjects were told
this story. In the story told to the other half, while contemplating
revenge, the army asks for advice from God, who sanctions them to
majorly chasten the other tribe.16
