Remarkably, what we’ve described here is a broad and reliable
dichotomy between two social systems, where A is a “pair-bonding”
species, B a “tournament” species.*
Pair- Tournament
Bonded
Male parental behavior Extensive Minimal
Male mating pickiness High Low
Variability in male reproductive success Low High
Testes size, sperm count Small/low Large/high
Levels of male-male aggression Low High
Degree of sexual dimorphism in body weight, physiology, Low High
coloration, and life span
Females select for Parenting Good genes
skill
Rates of cuckoldry High Low
Primates that pair-bond include South American monkeys like
marmosets, tamarins, and owl monkeys, and among the apes, gibbons
(with nonprimate examples including swans, jackals, beavers, and, of
course, chapter 4’s prairie voles). Classic tournament species include
baboons, mandrills, rhesus monkeys, vervets, and chimps (with
nonprimate examples including gazelles, lions, sheep, peacocks, and
elephant seals). Not all species fit perfectly into either extreme (stay
tuned). Nonetheless, the point is the internal logic with which the traits
of each of these types of species cluster, based on these evolutionary
principles.
Parent-Offspring Conflict
Another feature of behavior turns kin selection on its head. The
emphasis until now has been on the fact that relatives share many genes
and evolutionary goals. Nonetheless, except for identical twins, just as
pertinent is relatives not sharing all their genes or goals. Which can
cause conflict.
There’s parent-offspring conflict. One classic example is whether a
female should give her child great nutrition, guaranteeing his survival,
