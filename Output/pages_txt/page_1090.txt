* Something fascinating about the foxes and Moscow dogs: Both were selected primarily or exclusively for behavioral traits.
But along with those traits came changes in appearance: The foxes are cute—shorter snouts, rounder ears and foreheads, curly
tails, more varied coloration than standard foxes. And the Moscow dogs, exactly the opposite. If you want to domesticate a
species, breed it for arrested development—a dog is basically a baby wolf, interacting with humans as if they’re all Mommy,
and with the cute baby features. Same with the foxes, and just the opposite with the Moscow dogs. There is evidence that
domestication mostly works on genes disproportionately related to brain development.
