There is another use. In chapter 2 I recounted how it required the
demonstration of hippocampal volume loss in combat vets with PTSD to

provide childhoods filled with good health and safety, love and
nurturance and opportunity. But insofar as it seems to require precisely
that sort of scientific validation at times, more power to those factoids.
