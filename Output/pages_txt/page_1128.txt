* Note: The correlation between neocortex size and group size across primate species probably reflects each trait influencing
the other, i.e., coevolution of the two traits. The neuroimaging study shows that a bigger social group can cause interesting
parts of the brain to expand (in ways having far more to do with the neural plasticity of chapter 5 than with genes and
evolution).
