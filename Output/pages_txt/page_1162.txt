* Bowles cites a great example of this, where sanctions decrease in-group prosociality: Some parents are habitually late
picking up their kids at their preschool. “Please don’t do it,” the school e-mails all parents. “It delays our wonderful staff
from being able to leave work.” This helps, but still there are some parents who are habitually late. So the school institutes a
sanctions program—each time you’re late, we add a charge to your bill. And the rate of parental tardiness worsens. Why?
Because the transgression has been moved from the realm of in-group social intuition (“Hey, I shouldn’t be selfish toward
members of our school community”) to a more calculated realm (“Okay, I’m willing to incur an increased cost for my
convenience”). This might also be a way to frame the explanation for why, in that cross-cultural study of small-scale societies
discussed above, those with the most market integration had the most prosocial game play—what markets and cash
economies do is shift a world of reciprocal altruism from the realm of social intuition to social calculation.
