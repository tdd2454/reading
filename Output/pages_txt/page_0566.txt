hands included a second experiment. As before, subjects were told to
recall an immoral act of theirs. Afterward subjects either did or didn’t
have the opportunity to clean their hands. Those who were able to wash
were less likely to respond to a subsequent (experimentally staged)
request for help. In another study merely watching someone else wash
their hands in this situation (versus watching them type) also decreased
helpfulness afterward (although to a lesser extent than the subject
washing).23
Many of our moments of prosociality, of altruism and Good
Samaritanism, are acts of restitution, attempts to counter our antisocial
moments. What these studies show is that if those metaphorically dirtied
hands have been unmetaphorically washed in the interim, they’re less
likely to reach out to try to balance the scales.
