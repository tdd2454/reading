THE POSSIBILITIES
I
t’s remarkable the things humans can spend their lives studying. You
can be a coniologist or a caliologist, studying dust or birds’ nests,
respectively. There are batologists and brontologists, pondering brambles
and thunder, and vexillologists and zygologists, with their dazzling
knowledge of flags and of methods for fastening things. On and on—
odontology and odonatology, phenology and phonology, parapsychology
and parasitology. A rhinologist and a nosologist fall in love and have a
child who becomes a rhinological nosologist, studying the classification
of nose diseases.
The preceding pages suggest the possibility of “peaceology,” the
scientific study of the effects of trade, demographics, religion, intergroup
contact, reconciliation, and so on, on the ability of humans to live in
peace. An intellectual venture with great potential to help the world.
But with each new example of us at our worst, from the pinpricks of
petty meanness to massive carnage, this intellectual venture can feel like
rolling a boulder uphill. And thus, to falsely separate cognition and
affect, we conclude these many pages by fueling the emotional rather
than intellectual certainty that there is hope, that things can change, that
we can be changed, that we personally can cause change.
Rousseau with a Tail
For more than thirty years I spent my summers studying savanna
baboons in the Serengeti ecosystem in East Africa. I love baboons, but I
must admit that they’re often violent and abusive, so that the weak suffer
at the canines of the strong. Okay, some detachment—they’re a highly
sexually dimorphic tournament species with extensive escalated
aggression and a strong propensity toward frustration displacement—i.e.,
they can be intensely shitty to one another.
