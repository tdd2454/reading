Changes in the amount of dopaminergic activity in the “reward center” of the
brain following different magnitudes of reward. For the adolescents, the highs
are higher, the lows lower.

It’s unclear how much dopamine is released in anticipation of
reward. Some studies show more anticipatory activation of reward
pathways in adolescents than in adults, while others show the opposite,
with the least dopaminergic responsiveness in adolescents who are most
risk taking.19
Age differences in absolute levels of dopamine are less interesting
than differences in patterns of release. In a great study, children,
adolescents, and adults in brain scanners did some task where correct
responses produced monetary rewards of varying sizes (see figure
above).20 During this, prefrontal activation in both children and
adolescents was diffuse and unfocused. However, activation in the
nucleus accumbens in adolescents was distinctive. In children, a correct
answer produced roughly the same increase in activity regardless of size
of reward. In adults, small, medium, and large rewards caused small,
medium, and large increases in accumbens activity. And adolescents?
After a medium reward things looked the same as in kids and adults. A
large reward produced a humongous increase, much bigger than in
adults. And the small reward? Accumbens activity declined. In other
words, adolescents experience bigger-than-expected rewards more
