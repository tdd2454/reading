unproven, because (following an unuseful convention in the field) it is a
“theory” (like, say, germ theory). Evidence for the reality of evolution
includes:
Numerous examples where changing selective pressures
have changed gene frequencies in populations within
generations (e.g., bacteria evolving antibiotic
resistance). Moreover, there are also examples (mostly
insects, given their short generation times) of a species
in the process of splitting into two.
Voluminous fossil evidence of intermediate forms in
numerous taxonomic lineages.
Molecular evidence. We share ~98 percent of our genes
with the other apes, ~96 percent with monkeys, ~75
percent with dogs, ~20 percent with fruit flies. This
indicates that our last common ancestor with other apes
lived more recently than our last common ancestor with
monkeys, and so on.
Geographic evidence. To use Richard Dawkins’s
suggestion for dealing with a fundamentalist insisting
that all species emerged in their current forms from
Noah’s ark—how come all thirty-seven species of
lemurs that made landfall on Mt. Ararat in the Armenian
highlands hiked over to Madagascar, none dying and
leaving fossils in transit?
Unintelligent design—oddities explained only by
evolution. Why do whales and dolphins have vestigial
leg bones? Because they descend from a four-legged
terrestrial mammal. Why should we have arrector pili
muscles in our skin that produce thoroughly useless
gooseflesh? Because of our recent speciation from other
apes whose arrector pili muscles were attached to hair,
and whose hair stands up during emotional arousal.
Enough. Don’t get me started.
