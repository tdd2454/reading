* Which, to emphasize something that we all truly know but have trouble remembering, is not synonymous with happiness.
Extensive research on happiness, ranging from longitudinal studies of the same individuals over time to huge cross-cultural

poverty, they most definitely tend to become happier. But above the level of struggling to eke out an existence, there is
remarkably little relationship between income and happiness.
