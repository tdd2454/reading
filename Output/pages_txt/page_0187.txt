Various factors modulated kids’ fortitude (shown in later studies
described in Mischel’s book where, for some reason, it was pretzels
instead of marshmallows). Trusting the system mattered—if
experimenters had previously betrayed on promises, kids wouldn’t wait
as long. Prompting kids to think about how crunchy and yummy pretzels
are (what Mischel calls “hot ideation”) nuked self-discipline; prompts to
think about a “cold ideation” (e.g., the shape of pretzels) or an alternative
hot ideation (e.g., ice cream) bolstered resistance.
As expected, older kids hold out longer, using more effective
strategies. Younger kids describe strategies like “I kept thinking about
how good that second marshmallow would taste.” The problem, of
course, is that this strategy is about two synapses away from thinking
about the marshmallow in front of you. In contrast, older kids use
strategies of distraction—thinking about toys, pets, their birthday. This
progresses to reappraisal strategies (“This isn’t about marshmallows.
This is about the kind of person I am”). To Mischel, maturation of
willpower is more about distraction and reappraisal strategies than about
stoicism.
So kids improve at delayed gratification. Mischel’s next step made
his studies iconic—he tracked the kids afterward, seeing if marshmallow
wait time predicted anything about their adulthoods.
Did it ever. Five-year-old champs at marshmallow patience averaged
higher SAT scores in high school (compared with those who couldn’t
wait), with more social success and resilience and less aggressive* and
oppositional behavior. Forty years postmarshmallow, they excelled at
frontal function, had more PFC activation during a frontal task, and had
lower BMIs.21 A gazillion-dollar brain scanner doesn’t hold more
predictive power than one marshmallow. Every anxious middle-class
parent obsesses over these findings, has made marshmallows fetish
items.
