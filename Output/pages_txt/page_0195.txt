DIFFERENT ROUTES TO THE SAME
PLACE
I
anticipated that, with mothers now covered, we’d next examine the
adult consequences of, say, paternal deprivation, or childhood poverty, or
exposure to violence or natural disasters. And there’d be the same
question—what specific biological changes did each cause in children
that increased the odds of specific adult behaviors?
But this plan didn’t work—the similarities of effects of these varied
traumas are greater than the differences. Sure, there are specific links
(e.g., childhood exposure to domestic violence makes adult antisocial
violence more likely than does childhood exposure to hurricanes). But
they all converge sufficiently that I will group them together, as is done
in the field, as examples of “childhood adversity.”
Basically, childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having
(a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive
capabilities, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired
impulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior,
including violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of
childhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner).31 And despite that,
some individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine. More on this to
come.
We’ll now examine the biological links between childhood adversity
and increased risk of these adult outcomes.
