Everyone agrees that confounds from prenatal
environment, epigenetics, selective placement, range
restriction, and assumptions about equal environment
are unavoidable.
Most of these confounds inflate the perceived
importance of genes.
Efforts have been made to control for these confounds
and generally have shown that they are of less
magnitude than charged by many critics.
Crucially, these studies have mostly been about
psychiatric disorders, which, while plenty interesting,
aren’t terribly relevant to the concerns of this book. In
other words, no one has studied whether these
confounds matter when considering genetic influences
on, say, people’s tendency to endorse their culture’s
moral rules yet rationalize why those rules don’t apply
to them today, because they’re stressed and it’s their
birthday. Lots more work to be done.
The Fragile Nature of Heritability Estimates
Now starts a bruising, difficult, immensely important subject. I
review its logic every time I teach it, because it’s so unintuitive, and I’m
still always just words away from getting it wrong when I open my
mouth in class.
Behavior genetics studies usually produce a number called a
heritability score.28 For example, studies have reported heritability
scores in the 40 to 60 percent range for traits related to prosocial
behavior, resilience after psychosocial stress, social responsiveness,
political attitudes, aggression, and leadership potential.
What’s a heritability score? “What does a gene do?” is at least two
questions. How does a gene influence average levels of a trait? How
does a gene influence variation among people in levels of that trait?
These are crucially different. For example, how much do genes have
to do with people’s scores averaging 100 on this thing called an IQ test?
Then how much do genes have to do with one person scoring higher than
another?
