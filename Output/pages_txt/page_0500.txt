more willingness to punish unfair players (for both). I find this to be a
particularly challenging pair of findings, especially when framed as the
authors thoughtfully did.
The authors ask where the uniquely extreme sense of fairness comes
from in humans, particularly in the context of large-scale societies with
strangers frequently interacting. And they offer two traditional types of
explanations that are closely related to our dichotomies of intuition
versus reasoning and animal roots versus cultural inventions:
Our moral anchoring in fairness in large-scale societies
is a residue and extension of our hunter-gatherer and
nonhuman primate past. This was life in small bands,
where fairness was mostly driven by kin selection and
easy scenarios of reciprocal altruism. As our community
size has expanded and we now mostly have one-shot
interactions with unrelated strangers, our prosociality
just represents an expansion of our small-band mind-set,
as we use various green-beard marker shibboleths as
proxies for relatedness. I’d gladly lay down my life for
two brothers, eight cousins, or a guy who is a fellow
Packers fan.
The moral underpinnings of a sense of fairness lie in
cultural institutions and mind-sets that we invented as
our groups became larger and more sophisticated (as
reflected in the emergence of markets, cash economies,
and the like).
This many pages in, it’s obvious that I think the former scenario is
pretty powerful—look, we see the roots of a sense of fairness and justice
in the egalitarian nature of nomadic hunter-gatherers, in other primates,
in infants, in the preeminent limbic rather than cortical involvement. But,
inconveniently for that viewpoint, that’s totally counter to what emerges
from these studies—across the twenty-five cultures it’s the hunter-
gatherers, the ones most like our ancestors, living in the smallest groups,
with the highest degrees of relatedness and with the least reliance on
market interactions, who show the least tendency toward making fair
offers and are least likely to punish unfairness, whether to themselves or
