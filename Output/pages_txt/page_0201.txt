They’re more likely than pure bullies to use weapons and inflict serious
damage. As adults, they’re most at risk for depression, anxiety, and
suicidality.
In one study kids from these three categories read scenarios of
bullying.44 Bullied victims would condemn bullying and express
sympathy. Bullies would condemn bullying but rationalize the scenario
(e.g., this time it was the victim’s fault). And bully/bullied kids? They
would say bullying is okay. No wonder they have the worst outcome.
“The weak deserve to be bullied, so it’s fine when I bully. But that means
I deserve to be bullied at home. But I don’t, and that relative bullying me
is awful. Maybe then I’m awful when I bully someone. But I’m not,
because the weak deserve to be bullied. . . .” A Möbius strip from hell.*
