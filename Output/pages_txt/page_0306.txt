(a) a religion reflects the values of the culture that invented or adopted it,

We’ve now looked at various cultural factors—collectivism versus
individualism, egalitarian versus hierarchical distribution of resources,
and so on. While there are others to consider, it’s time to shift to the

as old as the weathered layers of Olduvai Gorge and as fresh as a
newborn baby’s tush, a topic that has scientists who study peace at one
another’s throats.
