Many neurons are also outlandishly large. A zillion red blood cells fit
on the proverbial period at the end of this sentence. In contrast, there are
single neurons in the spinal cord that send out projection cables many
feet long. There are spinal cord neurons in blue whales that are half the
length of a basketball court.
Now for the subparts of a neuron, the key to understanding its
function.
What neurons do is talk to one another, cause one another to get
excited. At one end of a neuron are its metaphorical ears, specialized
processes that receive information from another neuron. At the other end
are the processes that are the mouth, that communicate with the next
neuron in line.
The ears, the inputs, are called dendrites. The output begins with a
single long cable called an axon, which then ramifies into axonal endings
—these axon terminals are the mouths (ignore the myelin sheath for the
