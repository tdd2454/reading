* Two who participated in the killings eventually committed suicide. One, Lieutenant Stephen Brooks, did so for unknown
reasons while in Vietnam. The other, PFC Varnado Simpson, did so years later, after, among other things, seeing his ten-year-
old son killed by a stray bullet fired by neighborhood teens. He said, “He died in my arms. And when I looked at him, his
face was like the same face of the child that I had killed. And I said: This is the punishment for killing the people that I
killed.” He suffered from severe PTSD, sequestered himself in his home with windows shuttered for years, and succeeded on
his third suicide attempt.
