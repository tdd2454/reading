We belong to multiple hierarchies and can have very different ranks
in them.* Naturally, this invites rationalization and system justification—
deciding why hierarchies where we flounder are crap and the one where
we reign really counts.
Implicit in being part of multiple hierarchies is their potential
overlap. Consider socioeconomic status, which encompasses both local
and global hierarchies. I’m doing great socioeconomically—my car’s
fancier than yours. I’m doing terribly—I’m not richer than Bill Gates.
The Specialization of Some Ranking Systems
A high-ranking chimp is generally good at related things. But
humans can dwell in incredibly specialized hierarchies. Example:
There’s a guy named Joey Chestnut who’s a god in one subculture—he’s
the most successful competitive hot dog eater in history. However,
whether Chestnut’s gift generalizes to other domains is unclear.
Internal Standards
This is the circumstance of having internal standards independent of
the outside world. As an example, winning or losing at a team sport
generally increases or decreases, respectively, testosterone levels in men.
But things are subtler than that—testosterone more closely tracks
winning through skill (rather than luck), and also more closely tracks
individual (rather than team) performance.8

Thus, as usual, we are just like other animals but totally different. We
now consider the biology of individual ranks.
