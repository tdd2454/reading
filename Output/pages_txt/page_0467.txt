distinctive. This was tested in a 2007 study in which
volunteers were recruited through one of two newspaper
ads. The first described “a psychological study of prison
life”—the words used in the advertisement for the SPE
—while in the other the word “prison” was omitted. The
two groups of volunteers then underwent personality
testing. Importantly, volunteers for the “prison” study
scored higher than the others on measures of
aggressiveness, authoritarianism, and social dominance
and lower for empathy and altruism. Insofar as both
guards and prisoners in the SPE might have had this
makeup, it’s not clear why that would have biased
toward the famously brutal outcome.71
Finally, there’s science’s gold standard, independent
replication. If you redid the SPE, down to matching the
brand of the guards’ socks, would you get the same
result? Any study this big, idiosyncratic, and expensive
would be difficult to match perfectly in the replication
attempt. Moreover, Zimbardo actually published
remarkably little of the data about the SPE in
professional journals; instead he mostly wrote for the lay
public (hard to resist, given the attention the study
garnered). Thus there’s only really been one attempted
replication.
The 2001 “BBC Prison Study” was run by two respected British
psychologists, Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews and
Alex Haslam of the University of Exeter.72 As the name implies, it was
carried out (i.e., among other things, paid for) by the BBC, which filmed
it for a documentary. Its design replicated the broad features of the SPE.
As is so often the case, there was a completely different outcome. To
summarize a book’s worth of complex events:
Prisoners organized to resist any abuse by the guards.
Prisoner morale soared while guards became
demoralized and divided.
This led to a collapse of the guard/prisoner power
differential and ushered in a cooperative, power-sharing
