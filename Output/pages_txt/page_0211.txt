power differentials. Rather than “You kids, clean up this mess,” there’d
be the individuated, justifying request—“Caitlin, Zach, Dakota, could
you clean things up a bit please? Malala is coming for dinner.”*
We’ve now seen how childhood events—from the first mother-infant
interaction to the effects of culture—have persistent influences, and how
biology mediates such influences. When combined with the preceding
chapters, we have finished our tour of environmental effects on behavior,
from the second before a behavior occurs to a second after birth. In
effect, we’ve done “environment”; time for next chapter’s “genes.”
But this ignores something crucial: environment doesn’t begin at
birth.
