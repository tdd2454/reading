Racial Us/Them-ing can seem indelibly entrenched in
kids because the parents most intent on preventing it are
often lousy at it. As shown in studies, liberals are
typically uncomfortable discussing race with their
children. Instead they counter the lure of Us/Them-ing
with abstractions that mean squat to kids—“It’s
wonderful that everyone can be friends” or “Barney is
purple, and we love Barney.”
Thus, the strength of Us/Them-ing is shown by: (a) the speed and
minimal sensory stimuli required for the brain to process group
differences; (b) the unconscious automaticity of such processes; (c) its
presence in other primates and very young humans; and (d) the tendency
to group according to arbitrary differences, and to then imbue those
markers with power.
