So does this mean there is a gene “for” finding chest hair on guys to
be hot, for likelihood of voting, for feelings about dentists? Vanishingly
unlikely. Instead, gene and behavior are often connected by tortuous
routes.20 Consider the genetic influence on voter participation; the
mediating factor between the two turns out to be sense of control and
efficacy. People who vote regularly feel that their actions matter, and this
central locus of control reflects some genetically influenced personality
traits (e.g., high optimism, low neuroticism). Or how about the link
between genes and self-confidence? Some studies show that the
intervening variable is genetic effects on height; taller people are
considered more attractive and treated better, boosting their self-
confidence, dammit.*
In other words, genetic influences on behavior often work through
very indirect routes, something rarely emphasized when news broadcasts
toss out behavior genetics sound bites—“Scientists report genetic
influence on strategy when playing Candyland.”
The Debates About Twin and Adoption Studies
Many scientists have heavily criticized the assumptions in twin and
adoption studies, showing that they generally lead to overestimates of the
importance of genes.* Most behavior geneticists recognize these
problems but argue that the overestimates are tiny.21 A summary of this
technical but important debate:
Criticism #1: Twin studies are premised on MZ and same-sex DZ twin
pairs sharing environment equally (while sharing genes to very different
extents). This “equal environment assumption” (EEA) is simply wrong;
starting with parents, MZ twins are treated more similarly than DZ twins,
creating more similar environments for them. If this isn’t recognized,
greater similarity between MZs will be misattributed to genes.22
Scientists such as Kenneth Kendler of Virginia Commonwealth
University, a dean of the field, have tried to control for this by (a)
quantifying just how similar childhoods were for twins (with respect to
variables like sharing rooms, clothing, friends, teachers, and adversity);
(b) examining cases of “mistaken zygosity,” where parents were wrong
about their twins’ MZ/DZ status (thus, for example, raising their DZ
