* Actually, LTP in the spinal cord has more to do with “neuropathic” pain, syndromes where a severe injury causes all sorts
of nonnoxious stimuli to start hurting chronically—in effect, your spine has “learned” to always feel pain. Interestingly, such
LTP arises in part from the inflammation that accompanies the initial injury.
