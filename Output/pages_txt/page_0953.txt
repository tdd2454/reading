* The delayed attainment of legal adulthood in the West also sometimes reflected something as mundane as muscle mass. In
thirteenth-century England the age of legal majority was raised from fifteen to twenty-one years—protective armor was
getting heavier, and it wasn’t until the older age that males were typically strong enough to comport themselves in armor on
the battlefield. There is no mention as to whether the age of majority of the horses carrying these heavier weights was raised
as well. But sometimes technological advancements have made it possible for younger adolescents to join the ranks of adult
occupations—it has been pointed out that the development of lightweight automatic weapons has been a boon for the
usefulness of the estimated 300,000 child soldiers on earth.
