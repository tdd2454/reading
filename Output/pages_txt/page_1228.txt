* This makes sense only after introducing an additional fact. Thanks to random, probabilistic hiccups in the ion channels now
and then, neurons will occasionally have a random, spontaneous action potential from out of nowhere. So neuron A
intentionally fires off ten action potentials, followed soon after by two random ones. That might make it hard to tell if neuron
A meant to yell ten, eleven, or twelve times. By calibrating the circuit so that the inhibitory feedback signal shows up right
after the tenth action potential, the two random ones afterward are prevented, and it is easier to tell what neuron A meant. The
signal has been sharpened by damping the noise.
