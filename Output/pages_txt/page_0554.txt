EXAMPLE 2
I
n the Battle of Gettysburg fierce fighting occurred between the Union
First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry and Confederate Twenty-eighth
Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment.1 At one point Confederate soldier
John Eakin, carrying the regimental flag of the Twenty-eighth Virginia,
was shot three times (a typical fate of soldiers carrying the colors, who
were preferential targets). Mortally wounded, Eakin handed the flag to a
comrade, who was promptly killed. The flag was then taken up and
displayed by Colonel Robert Allen, who was soon killed, then by
Lieutenant John Lee, who was soon injured. A Union soldier, attempting
to seize the colors, was killed by Confederates. Finally Private Marshall
Sherman of the First Minnesota captured the flag, along with Lee.
