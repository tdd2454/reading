* I recently found a startling example of unorthodox defining of terms. This concerned Menachem Begin, one of the
surprising architects of the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978 as the prime minister of Israel. In the mid-1940s he headed
the Irgun, the Zionist paramilitary group intent on driving Britain out of Palestine in order to facilitate the founding of Israel.
The Irgun raised money to buy arms through extortion and robbery, hanged two captive British soldiers and booby-trapped
their bodies, and carried out a series of bombings including, most notoriously, an attack on British headquarters at
Jerusalem’s King David Hotel, an act that killed not only numerous British officials but also scores of Arab and Jewish
civilians. And Begin’s account of these activities? “Historically we were not ‘terrorists.’ We were, strictly speaking, anti-
terrorists” (my emphasis).
