* And, following that logic, if a trait associates with a particular version of an SNP in the promoter of a gene, you’ve just
gotten a hint that the regulation of the gene (as opposed to the gene itself) may be involved in that trait. As an example, the
gene for one type of serotonin receptor contains an SNP in the third base of the codon coding for the thirty-fourth amino acid
in the protein, and one of the variants of that SNP is associated with responsiveness to a particular drug in schizophrenics.
