THE STRENGTH OF US/THEM
O
ur brains form Us/Them
dichotomies (henceforth,
“Us/Them-ing,” for brevity) with
stunning speed.2 As discussed in
chapter 3, fifty-millisecond
exposure to the face of someone of
another race activates the
amygdala, while failing to activate
the fusiform face area as much as
same-race faces do—all within a
few hundred milliseconds.
Similarly, the brain groups faces by
gender or social status at roughly
the same speed.
Rapid, automatic biases against a Them can be demonstrated with the
fiendishly clever Implicit Association Test (IAT).3
Suppose you are unconsciously prejudiced against trolls. To simplify
the IAT enormously: A computer screen flashes either pictures of
humans or trolls or words with positive connotations (e.g., “honest”) or
negative ones (“deceitful”). Sometimes the rule is “If you see a human or
a positive term, press the red button; if it’s a troll or a negative term,
press the blue button.” And sometimes it’s “Human or negative term,
press red; troll or positive term, press blue.” Because of your antitroll
bias, pairing a troll with a positive term, or a human with a negative, is
discordant and slightly distracting. Thus you pause for a few
milliseconds before pressing a button.
It’s automatic—you’re not fuming about clannish troll business
practices or troll brutality in the Battle of Somewhere in 1523. You’re
processing words and pictures, and unconsciously you pause, stopped by
the dissonance linking troll and “lovely,” or human and “malodorous.”
Run enough rounds and that pattern of delay emerges, revealing your
bias.
