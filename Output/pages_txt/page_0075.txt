the pressing is finished, dopamine levels start rising, driven by the
uncertainty of “maybe yes, maybe no.”

Modify things further; reward now occurs 25 or 75 percent of the
time. A shift from 50 to 25 percent and a shift from 50 to 75 percent are
exactly opposite, in terms of the likelihood of reward, and work from
Knutson’s group shows that the greater the probability of reward, the
more activation in the medial PFC.96 But switches from 50 to 25 percent
and from 50 to 75 percent both reduce the magnitude of uncertainty. And
the secondary rise of dopamine for a 25 or 75 percent likelihood of
reward is smaller than for 50 percent. Thus, anticipatory dopamine
release peaks with the greatest uncertainty as to whether a reward will
occur.* Interestingly, in circumstances of uncertainty, enhanced
anticipatory dopamine release is mostly in the mesocortical rather than
mesolimbic pathway, implying that uncertainty is a more cognitively
complex state than is anticipation of predictable reward.
None of this is news to the honorary psychologists running Las
Vegas. Logically, gambling shouldn’t evoke much anticipatory
dopamine, given the astronomical odds against winning. But the
behavioral engineering—the 24-7 activity and lack of time cues, the
cheap alcohol pickling frontocortical judgment, the manipulations to
make you feel like today is your lucky day—distorts and shifts the
perception of the odds into a range where dopamine pours out and, oh,
why not, let’s try again.
