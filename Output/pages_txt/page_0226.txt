Back to When You Were
Just a Fertilized Egg
I
’m reminded of a cartoon where one lab-coated scientist is telling the
other, “You know how you’re on the phone, and the other person
wants to get off but won’t say it, so they say, ‘Well, you probably need to
get going,’ like you’re the one who wants to get off, when it’s really
them? I think I found the gene for that.”
This chapter is about progress in finding “the gene for that.”

Our prototypical behavior has occurred. How was it influenced by events
when the egg and sperm that formed that person joined, creating their
genome—the chromosomes, the sequences of DNA—destined to be
duplicated in every cell in that future person’s body? What role did those
genes play in causing that behavior?
Genes are relevant to, say, aggression, which is why we’re less
alarmed if a toddler pulls at the ears of a basset hound rather than a pit
bull. Genes are relevant to everything in this book. Many
neurotransmitters and hormones are coded for by genes. As are
molecules that construct or degrade those messengers, as are their
receptors. Ditto for growth factors guiding brain plasticity. Genes
typically come in different versions; we each consist of an individuated
orchestration of the different versions of our approximately twenty
thousand genes.
This topic carries two burdens. The first reflects many people being
troubled by linking genes with behavior—in one incident from my
academic youth, a federally funded conference was canceled for
225
