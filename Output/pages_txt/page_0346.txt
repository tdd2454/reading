We start with a long theorized type of pseudo–kin recognition. What
if you operate with the rule that you cooperate with (i.e., act related to)
individuals who share conspicuous traits with you? This facilitates
passing on copies of genes if you possess a gene (or genes) with three
properties: (a) it generates that conspicuous signal; (b) recognizes it in
others; and (c) makes you cooperate with others who have that signal.
It’s a kind of primitive, stripped-down kin selection.
Hamilton speculated about the existence of such a “green-beard
effect”; if an organism has a gene that codes for both growing a green
beard and cooperating with other green bearders, green bearders will
flourish when mixed with non–green bearders.26 Thus, “the crucial
requirement for altruism is genetic relatedness at the altruism locus [i.e.,
merely a multifaceted green-beard gene] and not genealogical
relationship over the whole genome.”27
Green-beard genes exist. Among yeast, cells form cooperative
aggregates that need not be identical or even closely related. Instead, it
could be any yeast that expresses a gene coding for a cell-surface
adhesion protein that sticks to copies of the same molecule on other
cells.28
Humans show green-beard effects. Crucially, we differ as to what
counts as a green-beard trait. Define it narrowly, and we call it
parochialism. Include enmity toward those without that green-beard trait
and it’s xenophobia. Define the green-beard trait as being a member of
your species, and you’ve described a deep sense of humanity.
