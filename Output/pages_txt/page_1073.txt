* The 1962 geopolitical thriller Fail-Safe, by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler, was premised on a Tit for Tat solution to
a signal error. An electronic glitch causes an air force squadron of bombers with nuclear weapons to believe that the United
States is under nuclear attack by the USSR; they are to destroy Moscow. The Americans and Soviets see what is happening,
and the U.S. military unsuccessfully tries to get the planes to turn back; the Soviets assume the American “Oops, sorry” is a
ruse and prepare an all-out counterattack. The American president (modeled on JFK) tries to show his sincerity and stop the
attack by sending up fighters to help Soviet jets shoot down the bomber squadron. A few are shot down, but a few get
through, and most of the Soviet brass are still convinced it is a ruse. Finally, as the only means to prevent an all-out nuclear
exchange, the president does a Tit for Tat, ordering a bomber to drop an equivalent bomb on New York City. Bummer of a
signal error. This book scared the willies out of me when I was a kid. I’d regularly scan the skies over my hometown, New
York, waiting to see the inevitable bomber.
