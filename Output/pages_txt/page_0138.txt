“AHA” VERSUS ACTUALLY
REMEMBERING
B
ut this has only gotten us to first base. The lightbulb going on in
the middle of the lecture doesn’t mean it’ll still be on in an hour, let
alone during the final exam. How can we make that burst of excitation
persist, so that NMDA receptors “remember,” are more easily activated
in the future? How does the potentiated excitation become long term?
This is our cue to introduce the iconic concept of LTP—“long-term
potentiation.” LTP, first demonstrated in 1966 by Terje Lømo at the
University of Oslo, is the process by which the first burst of NMDA
receptor activation causes a prolonged increase in excitability of the
synapse.* Hundreds of productive careers have been spent figuring out
how LTP works, and the key is that when NMDA receptors finally
activate and open their channels, it is calcium, rather than sodium, that
flows in. This causes an array of changes; here are a few:
The calcium tidal wave causes more copies of glutamate
receptors to be inserted into the dendritic spine’s
membrane, making the neuron more responsive to
glutamate thereafter.*
The calcium also alters glutamate receptors that are
already on the front lines of that dendritic spine; each
will now be more sensitive to glutamate signals.*
The calcium also causes the synthesis of peculiar
neurotransmitters in the dendritic spine, which are
released and travel backward across the synapse; there
they increase the amount of glutamate released from the
axon terminal after future action potentials.
In other words, LTP arises from a combination of the presynaptic
axon terminal yelling “glutamate” more loudly and the postsynaptic
dendritic spine listening more attentively.
