Eventually the paroxysms about adaptationism versus spandrels,
gradualism versus punctuated change, and the very notion of a science of
human sociobiology subsided. The political posturing lost steam, the
demographic contrasts between the two camps softened, the general
quality of research improved considerably, and everybody got some gray
hair and a bit more calm.
This has paved the way for a sensible, middle-of-the-road middle age
for the field. There’s clear empirical evidence for both gradualism and
punctuated change, and for molecular mechanisms underlying both.
There’s less adaptation than extreme adaptationists claim, but fewer
spandrels than touted by spandrelites. While sociobiology may explain
too much and predict too little, it does predict many broad features of
behavior and social systems across species. Moreover, even though the
notion of selection happening at the level of groups has been resurrected
from the graves of self-sacrificial elderly wildebeest, it is probably a rare
occurrence; nonetheless, it is most likely to occur in the species that is
the focus of this book. Finally, all of this is anchored in evolution being a
fact, albeit a wildly complex one.

Remarkably, we’ve finished this first part of the book. A behavior has
occurred; what happened in everything from a second to a million years
earlier that helps explain why it happened? Some themes have come up
repeatedly:
The context and meaning of a behavior are usually more
interesting and complex than the mechanics of the
behavior.
To understand things, you must incorporate neurons and
hormones and early development and genes, etc., etc.
These aren’t separate categories—there are few clear-cut
causal agents, so don’t count on there being the brain
region, the neurotransmitter, the gene, the cultural
influence, or the single anything that explains a
behavior.
