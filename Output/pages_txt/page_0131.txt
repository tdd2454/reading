Thus, sustained stress has some pretty unappealing behavioral
effects. Nonetheless there are circumstances where stress brings out the
magnificent best in some people. Work by Shelley Taylor of UCLA
shows that “fight or flight” is the typical response to stress in males, and
naturally, the stress literature is predominantly studies of males by
males.83 Things often differ in females. Showing that she can match the
good old boys when it comes to snappy sound bites, Taylor framed the
female stress response as being more about “tend and befriend”—caring
for your young and seeking social affiliation. This fits with striking sex
differences in stress management styles, and tend-and-befriend most
likely reflects the female stress response involving a stronger component
of oxytocin secretion.
Naturally, things are subtler than “male = fight/flight and female =
tend/befriend.” There are frequent counterexamples to each; stress elicits
prosociality in more males than just pair-bonded male marmosets, and
we saw that females are plenty capable of aggression. Then there’s
Mahatma Gandhi and Sarah Palin.* Why are some people exceptions to
these gender stereotypes? That’s part of what the rest of this book is
about.
Stress can disrupt cognition, impulse control, emotional regulation,
decision making, empathy, and prosociality. One final point. Recall from
chapter 2 how the frontal cortex making you do the harder thing when
it’s the right thing is value free—“right thing” is purely instrumental.
Same with stress. Its effects on decision making are “adverse” only in a
neurobiological sense. During a stressful crisis, an EMT may become
perseverative, making her ineffectual at saving lives. A bad thing.
During a stressful crisis, a sociopathic warlord may become
perseverative, making him ineffectual at ethnically cleansing a village.
Not a bad thing.
