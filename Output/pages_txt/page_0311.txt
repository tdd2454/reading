violent deaths are far lower than 15 percent. Moreover,
there are regions and periods lacking any evidence of
warlike violence. The glee in refuting the broadest
conclusions of Keeley and Pinker is unmistakable (e.g.,
Ferguson in the previously cited work: “For 10,000
years in the Southern Levant, there is not one single
instance where it can be said with confidence, ‘war was
there.’ [his emphasis] Am I wrong? Name the place.”).
Thus these critics conclude that wars were rare prior to
human civilizations. Supporters of Keeley and Pinker
retort that you can’t ignore bloodbaths like Crow Creek
or Jebel Sahaba and that the absence of proof (of early
war in so many of these sites) is not proof of absence.
This suggests a second strategy for contemporary Hobbes-versus-
Rousseau debates, namely to study contemporary humans in prestate
tribal societies. How frequently do they war?
Prehistorians in the Flesh
Well, if researchers endlessly argue about who or what gnawed on a
ten-thousand-year-old human bone, imagine the disagreements about
actual living humans.
Keeley and Pinker, along with Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe
Institute, conclude that warfare is nearly universal in contemporary
nonstate societies. This is the world of headhunters in New Guinea and
Borneo, Maasai and Zulu warriors in Africa, Amazonians on raiding
parties in the rain forest. Keeley estimates that, in the absence of
pacification enforced by outside forces such as a government, 90 to 95
percent of tribal societies engage in warfare, many constantly, and a
much higher percentage are at war at any time than is the case for state
societies. For Keeley the rare peaceful tribal societies are usually so
because they have been defeated and dominated by a neighboring tribe.
Keeley charges that there has been systematic underreporting of violence
by contemporary anthropologists intent on pacifying living relics of the
past.
