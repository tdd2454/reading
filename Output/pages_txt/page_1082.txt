* Neuroscientists often use the term “endophenotype,” which basically means “a trait that we used to be unable to detect at
the phenotypic level but now can, thanks to some invention, so we’re going to call it an endophenotype, meaning a newly
observable trait that is kind of inside you.” Your blood type is an endophenotype, detectable with an assay on a blood sample;
the size of your amygdala is an endophenotype, detectable with a brain scanner.
