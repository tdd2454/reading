onsider two different scenarios. First:
Think back to when you hit puberty. You’d been primed by a
parent or teacher about what to expect. You woke up with a funny
feeling, found your jammies alarmingly soiled. You excitedly woke up
your parents, who got tearful; they took embarrassing pictures, a sheep
was slaughtered in your honor, and you were carried through town in a
sedan chair while neighbors chanted in an ancient language. This was a
big deal.
But be honest—would your life be so different if those endocrine
changes had instead occurred twenty-four hours later?
Second:
Emerging from a store, you are unexpectedly chased by a lion. As
part of the stress response, your brain increases your heart rate and blood
pressure, dilates blood vessels in your leg muscles, which are now
frantically working, and sharpens sensory processing to produce a tunnel
vision of concentration.
How would things have turned out if your brain took twenty-four
hours to send those commands? You’d be dead meat.
That’s what makes the brain special. Hit puberty tomorrow instead of
today? So what. Make some antibodies tonight instead of now? Rarely
fatal. Same for delaying depositing calcium in your bones. But much of
what the nervous system is about is encapsulated in the framing of
chapter 2—what happened one second before? Incredible speed.
