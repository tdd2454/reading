In what sense is the status/health relationship in humans less subtle
than in other primates?25 In that it reflects the most permeating form of
status any primate has invented, namely socioeconomic status (SES).
Numerous studies examine the “health/SES” gradient, the fact that life
expectancy and the incidence and morbidity of numerous diseases are
worse in poor people.
To summarize this sprawling topic that was reviewed in chapter 9:
Which comes first—poverty or poor health?
Overwhelmingly the former. Recall that developing in a
low-SES womb makes poorer health as an adult more
likely.
It’s not that the poor have poor health and everyone else
is equally healthy. For every step down the SES ladder,
health is worse.
The problem isn’t that poor people have less health-care
access. The gradient occurs in countries with socialized
medicine and universal health care and for diseases
whose incidence is independent of health-care access.
Only about a third of the variability is explained by the
poor being exposed to more health risk factors (e.g.,
pollution) and fewer protective factors (e.g., health club
memberships).
The gradient seems to be about the psychological
baggage of SES. (a) Subjective SES predicts health at
least as accurately as objective SES, meaning that it’s
not about being poor. It’s about feeling poor. (b)
Independent of absolute levels of income, the more
income inequality in a community—meaning the more
frequently the poor have their noses rubbed in their low
status—the steeper the health gradient. (c) Lots of
inequality in a community makes for low social capital
(trust and a sense of efficacy), and that’s the most direct
cause of the poor health. Collectively these studies show
that the psychological stress of low SES is what
decreases health. Consistent with that, it is diseases that
are most sensitive to stress (cardiovascular,
