Southern, but not Northern, college studies show strong physiological responses
to a social provocation.

Southern violence was explored in one of the all-time coolest
psychology studies, involving the use of a word rare in science journals,
conducted by Nisbett and Cohen. Undergraduate male subjects had a
blood sample taken. They then filled out a questionnaire about
something and were then supposed to drop it off down the hall. It was in
the narrow hallway, filled with file cabinets, that the experiment
happened. Half the subjects traversed the corridor uneventfully. But with
half, a confederate (get it? ha-ha) of the psychologists, a big beefy guy,
approached from the opposite direction. As the subject and the plant
squeezed by each other, the latter would jostle the subject and, in an
irritated voice, say the magic word—“asshole”—and march on. Subject
would continue down the hall to drop off the questionnaire.
What was the response to this insult? It depended. Subjects from the
South, but not from elsewhere, showed massive increases in levels of
testosterone and glucocorticoids—anger, rage, stress. Subjects were then
told a scenario where a guy observes a male acquaintance making a pass
at his fiancée—what happens next in the story? In control subjects,
Southerners were a bit more likely than Northerners to imagine a violent
outcome. And after being insulted? No change in Northerners and a
massive boost in imagined violence among Southerners.
