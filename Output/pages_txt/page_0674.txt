We aren’t chimps, and we aren’t bonobos. We’re not a
classic pair-bonding species or a tournament species.
We’ve evolved to be somewhere in between in these and
other categories that are clear-cut in other animals. It
makes us a much more malleable and resilient species. It
also makes our social lives much more confusing and
messy, filled with imperfection and wrong turns.
The homunculus has no clothes.
While traditional nomadic hunter-gatherer life over
hundreds of thousands of years might have been a little
on the boring side, it certainly wasn’t ceaselessly
bloody. In the years since most humans abandoned a
hunter-gatherer lifestyle, we’ve obviously invented
many things. One of the most interesting and
challenging is social systems where we can be
surrounded by strangers and can act anonymously.
Saying a biological system works “well” is a value-free
assessment; it can take discipline, hard work, and
willpower to accomplish either something wondrous or
something appalling. “Doing the right thing” is always
context dependent.
Many of our best moments of morality and compassion
have roots far deeper and older than being mere
products of human civilization.
Be dubious about someone who suggests that other
types of people are like little crawly, infectious things.
When humans invented socioeconomic status, they
invented a way to subordinate like nothing that
hierarchical primates had ever seen before.
“Me” versus “us” (being prosocial within your group) is
easier than “us” versus “them” (prosociality between
groups).
It’s not great if someone believes it’s okay for people to
do some horrible, damaging act. But more of the world’s
misery arises from people who, of course, oppose that
horrible act . . . but cite some particular circumstances
that should make them exceptions. The road to hell is
paved with rationalization.
