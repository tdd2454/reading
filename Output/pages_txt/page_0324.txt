Fry has provided what I consider the cleanest assessment of warfare
in such cultures. In a notable 2013 Science paper, he and Finnish
anthropologist Patrik Söderberg reviewed all cases of lethal violence in
the ethnographic literature in “pure” nomadic HGs (i.e., well studied
before extensive contact with outsiders and living in a stable ecosystem).
The sample consisted of twenty-one such groups from around the world.
Fry and Söderberg observed what might be called warfare (defined by
the fairly unstringent criterion of conflict producing multiple casualties)
in only a minority of the cultures. Not exactly widespread. This is
probably the best approximation we’ll ever get about warfare in our HG
