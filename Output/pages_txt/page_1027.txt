* For aficionados: The testosterone receptor contains what is called a polyglutamine repeat—a stretch of the protein where
the same amino acid, called glutamine, is repeated. Importantly, there is tremendous variability among people as to how many
glutamine repeats there are; the fewer, the more potently the androgen receptor works. Recall that receptors for steroid
hormones like testosterone work as transcription factors, and proteins that have polyglutamine repeats are often transcription
factors.
