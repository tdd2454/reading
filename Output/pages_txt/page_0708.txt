The Basics of
Endocrinology
E
ndocrinology is the study of hormones, very different sorts of
messengers from the neurotransmitters of chapter 2. As a recap,
neurotransmitters are released from neurons’ axon terminals in response
to action potentials. Once released, they travel a microscopic distance
across the synapse and bind to receptors on dendrites of the second,
postsynaptic neuron, thereby changing that neuron’s excitability.
In contrast, a hormone is a chemical messenger released from
secretory cells (including neurons) in various glands. Once secreted, it
enters the bloodstream, where it can influence any cells throughout the
body that possess receptors for it.* So right off the bat we have key
differences. First, neurotransmitters directly affect only neurons on the
other side of synapses, while a hormone can potentially affect each of the
trillions of cells in the body. A second difference is the time course;
neurotransmitter signaling across synapses occurs in milliseconds. In
contrast, many hormonal effects emerge over hours to days and can
persist forever (for example, how often does puberty go away after a
while?).
Neurotransmitters and hormones also differ in the scale of their
effects. A neurotransmitter binds to its postsynaptic receptor, resulting in
a local change in the flow of ions across the membrane of that dendritic
spine. But depending on the hormone and the target cell being
considered, hormones can change the activity of particular proteins, turn
