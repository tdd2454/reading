a. Distraction. Subjects were too busy thinking about, say,
carrots to do automatic categorization by race. This
would resemble the effect of searching for the dot.
b. Recategorization. You look at a Them face, thinking
about what food they’d like. You picture the person
shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, sitting down
to dinner at home and enjoying a particular food. . . . In
other words, you think of the person as an individual.
This is the readily accepted interpretation.
But recategorization can occur in the real world under the most brutal
and unlikely circumstances. Here are examples that I find to be intensely
poignant:
In the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate general Lewis
Armistead was mortally wounded while leading a charge. As he
lay on the battlefield, he gave a secret Masonic sign, in hopes of
its being recognized by a fellow Mason. It was, by a Union
officer, Hiram Bingham, who protected him, got him to a Union
field hospital, and guarded his personal effects. In an instant the
Us/Them of Union/Confederate became less important than that
of Mason/non-Mason.*52
Another shifting of Thems also occurred during the Civil War.
Both armies were filled with Irish immigrant soldiers; Irish
typically had picked sides haphazardly, joining what they
thought would be a short conflict to gain some military training
—useful for returning home to fight for Irish independence.
Before battle, Irish soldiers put identifying sprigs of green in
their hats, so that, should they lie dead or dying, they’d shed the
arbitrary Us/Them of this American war and revert to the Us that
mattered—to be recognized and aided by their fellow Irish.53 A
green sprig as a green beard.
Rapid shifting of Us/Them dichotomies is seen during World
War II, when British commandos kidnapped German general
Heinrich Kreipe in Crete, followed by a dangerous eighteen-day
