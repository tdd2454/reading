AFFECT AND/OR COGNITION?
T
his again. We can predict the major punch lines, thanks to the
previous three chapters: both cognitive and affective components
contribute to healthy empathic states; it’s silly to debate which is more
important; what’s interesting is seeing when one predominates over the
other. Even more interesting is to look at the neurobiology of how those
components interact.
The Affective Side of Things
When it comes to empathy, all neurobiological roads pass through
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As introduced in chapter 2, this
frontal cortical structure has starred in empathy neuroscience ever since
people felt someone else’s pain while inside a brain scanner.12
Given its more traditional roles in mammals, the ACC’s empathy
connection is unexpected. Broadly, those roles are:
Processing interoceptive information. As introduced in
chapter 3, our brains monitor sensory information not
only from outside us but from our internal world as well
—interoceptive information about achy muscles, dry
mouths, bowels in an uproar. If you unconsciously sense
that your heart is racing and that makes you experience
some emotion more intensely, thank the ACC. The ACC
funnels literal gut feelings into intuitions and
metaphorical gut feelings influencing frontal function.
Pain is a key type of interoceptive information that
catches the ACC’s attention.13
Conflict monitoring. The ACC responds to “conflict” in
the sense of a discrepancy from what is expected. If you
associate doing some behavior with a particular
outcome, when that outcome doesn’t occur, the ACC
takes notice. This monitoring of discrepancy from
