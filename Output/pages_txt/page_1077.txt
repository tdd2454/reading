* The importance of founder populations was something championed by one of the giants of evolutionary biology, Ernst
Mayr of Harvard; in his view, small founder populations were the driving force for new species forming; it is an extension of
his thinking to view transient founder populations as a means to establish cooperation in a larger population. Remarkably,
Mayr published four well-received books when he was over age ninety, the last one (What Makes Biology Unique?) in 2004
at age one hundred, shortly before his death. Inspirational guy, for a bunch of reasons.
