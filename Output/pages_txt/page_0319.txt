To start, it was once assumed that among HGs, women do the
gathering while men supply most of the calories by hunting. In actuality,
the majority of calories come from foraging; men spend lots of time
talking about how awesome they were in the last hunt and how much
awesomer they’ll be in the next—among some Hadza, maternal
grandmothers supply more calories to families than do the Man the
Hunter men.69
The arc of human history is readily equated with an arc of progress,
and key to the latter is the view that agriculture was the best thing
humans ever invented; I’ll rant about that later. A cornerstone of the
agriculture lobby is the idea that primordial HGs were half starved. In
reality, HGs typically work fewer hours for their daily bread than do
traditional farmers and are longer-lived and healthier. In the words of
anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, HGs were the original affluent society.
