PART 3: SO WHAT DO GENES
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WITH
BEHAVIORS WE’RE INTERESTED IN?
The Marriage of Behavior Genetics and Molecular
Genetics
Behavior genetics has gotten a huge boost by incorporating
molecular approaches—after examining similarities and differences
between twins or adoptees, find the actual genes that underlie those
similarities and differences. This powerful approach has identified
various genes relevant to our interests. But first, our usual caveats: (a)
not all of these findings consistently replicate; (b) effect sizes are
typically small (in other words, some gene may be involved, but not in a
major way); and (c) the most interesting findings show
gene/environment interactions.
Studying Candidate Genes
Gene searches can take a “candidate” approach or a genomewide
association approach (stay tuned). The former requires a list of plausible
suspects—genes already known to be related to some behavior. For
example, if you’re interested in a behavior that involves serotonin,
obvious candidate genes would include those coding for enzymes that
make or degrade serotonin, pumps that remove it from the synapse, or
serotonin receptors. Pick one that interests you, and study it in animals
using molecular tools to generate “knockout” mice (where you’ve
eliminated that gene) or “transgenic” mice (with an extra copy of the
gene). Make manipulations like these only in certain brain regions or at
certain times. Then examine what’s different about behavior. Once
you’re convinced of an effect, ask whether variants of that gene help
explain individual differences in human versions of the behavior. I start
with the topic that has gotten the most attention, for better or worse,
mostly “worse.”
