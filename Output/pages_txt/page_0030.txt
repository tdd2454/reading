THE LIMBIC SYSTEM

o make sense of our best and worst behaviors, automaticity,
emotion, and cognition must all be considered; I arbitrarily start
with layer 2 and its emphasis on emotion.
Early-twentieth-century neuroscientists thought it obvious what layer
2 did. Take your standard-issue lab animal, a rat, and examine its brain.
Right at the front would be these two gigantic lobes, the “olfactory
bulbs” (one for each nostril), the primary receptive area for odors.
Neuroscientists at the time asked what parts of the brain these
gigantic rodent olfactory bulbs talked to (i.e., where they sent their
axonal projections). Which brain regions were only a single synapse
away from receiving olfactory information, which were two synapses,
three, and so on?
And it was layer 2 structures that received the first communiqués.
Ah, everyone concluded, this part of the brain must process odors, and so
it was termed the rhinencephalon—the nose brain.
Meanwhile, in the thirties and forties, neuroscientists such as the
young MacLean, James Papez, Paul Bucy, and Heinrich Klüver were
starting to figure out what the layer 2 structures did. For example, if you
lesion (i.e., destroy) layer 2 structures, this produces “Klüver-Bucy
syndrome,” featuring abnormalities in sociality, especially in sexual and
