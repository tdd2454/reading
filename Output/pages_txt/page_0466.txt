Milgram seems to have fudged some of his work. Perry
has analyzed Milgram’s unpublished papers and
recordings of sessions, finding that teachers refused to
shock much more frequently than reported. However,
despite the seemingly inflated results, the finding of
roughly 60 percent compliance rates has been
replicated.70
Few of the replicating studies were traditional academic
ones published in peer-reviewed journals. Instead most
have been re-creations for films and television
programs.
Perhaps most important, as analyzed by Perry, far more
teachers than Milgram indicated realized that the learner
was an actor and that there were no actual shocks. This
problem probably extends to the replications as well.
The SPE has arguably attracted the most controversy.
The biggest lightning rod was the role of Zimbardo
himself. Rather than being a detached observer, he
served as the prison’s “superintendent.” He set the
ground rules (e.g., telling guards that they could make
the prisoners feel afraid and helpless) and met regularly
with the guards throughout. He was clearly excited as
hell to see what was happening in the study. Zimbardo is
a larger-than-life force of nature, someone whom you’d
very much wish to please. Thus guards were subject to
pressure not only to conform with their cohort but also
to obey and please Zimbardo; his role, consciously or
otherwise, almost certainly prompted the guards to more
extreme behavior. Zimbardo, a humane, decent man who
is a friend and colleague, has written at length about this
distortive impact that he had on the study.
At the beginning of the study, volunteers were randomly
assigned to be guards or prisoners, and the resulting two
groups did not differ on various personality measures.
While that’s great, what was not appreciated was the
possibility that the volunteers as a whole were
