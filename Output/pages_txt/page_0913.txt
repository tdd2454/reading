* This generated all sorts of caustic discussions at conferences as to whether this constituted a case of “gene transfer” (i.e.,
the value-neutral process of transferring a novel gene into an individual in order to alter a function) or “gene therapy” (i.e.,
transferring a gene in order to cure those montane males of the disease of infidelity). It strikes me that if that research had
been carried out instead at Berkeley during the Summer of Love in 1967, the gene-therapy goal would have been to make
prairie voles transcend their Middle American bourgeois genetics and become polygamous. The times, they are a changin’ to
quote a recent Nobel Laureate.
