types of breast cancer involve tumors whose cells are “ER positive”—
i.e., they contain estrogen receptors and are responsive to the growth-
promoting effects of the hormone.
This is our overview of how hormones alter the functions of target
cells over the course of hours to days. Hormones were highly pertinent in
chapter 7 when considering the effects of hormones in childhood and
fetal life. Specifically, hormones can have permanent “organizational”
effects during development, shaping how the brain is constructed. In
contrast, “activational” effects persist for hours to days. These two
domains interact, in that organizational hormone effects on a fetal brain
influence what activational effects hormones will have on that brain in
adulthood.
