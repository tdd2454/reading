* Remember, these were predominantly psychologically sound college students. In the SPE nearly all of them had indicated
at the beginning that they would rather be a prisoner than a guard, and a number indicated that they had volunteered in order
to learn what prison would be like, expecting to be jailed at some point for civil-rights or antiwar activity. And as is often
underemphasized in accounts of the SPE, many of the prisoners, as well as the guards, were deeply distressed afterward,
having seen how readily they were broken into passivity.
