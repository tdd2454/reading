So neuron C sends an excitatory projection on to neuron D. But in
addition, neuron C’s axon sends collateral inhibitory projections on to
neurons A and E.* Thus, if neuron C is stimulated, it both stimulates
neuron D and silences neurons A and E. With such “lateral inhibition,” C
screams its head off while A and E become especially silent. It’s a means
of sharpening a spatial signal (and note that the diagram is simplified, in
that I’ve omitted something obvious—neurons A and E also send
inhibitory collateral projection on to neuron C, as well as to the neurons
on the other sides of them in this imaginary network).
Lateral inhibition like this is ubiquitous in sensory systems. Shine a
tiny dot of light onto an eye. Wait, was that photoreceptor neuron A, C,
or E that just got stimulated? Thanks to lateral inhibition, it is clearer that
it was C. Ditto in tactile systems, allowing you to tell that it was this
smidgen of skin that was just touched, not a little this way or that. Or the
ears telling you it was definitely an A, not an A-sharp or A-flat.*
Thus what we’ve seen is another example of contrast enhancement in
the nervous system. What is the significance of the fact that the silent
state of a neuron is negatively charged, rather than a neutral 0 mV? It’s a
way of sharpening a signal within a neuron. Feedback, feed-forward, and
lateral inhibition? A way of sharpening a signal within a circuit.
