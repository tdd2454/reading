* In a follow-up study, one that, incongruously, I was involved in, similar issues were examined concerning one target
individual—Barack Obama—during the 2008 election season. Subjects were presented with swatches of different shades of
brown and were asked which most accurately matched Obama’s skin color. Women who viewed him as more white were
more likely to vote for him at their time of ovulation; women who viewed him as more black showed the opposite. Of note,
these are small effects. Electability is in the eye, and the hormone status, of the beholder.
