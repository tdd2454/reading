neurons just had breakfast. At such times, a line having finally been
drawn must be more important than its arbitrariness.
The second issue concerns responsibility. When debriefed afterward,
compliant teachers typically cited how persuasive they found the
information that the learner had been informed of the risks and had given
consent. “Don’t worry, you won’t be held responsible.” The Milgram
phenomenon also showed the coercive power of misdirecting
responsibility, when researchers would seek compliance by emphasizing
that the teacher’s responsibility was to the project, not the learner—“I
thought you said you were here to help.” “You’re a team member.”
“You’re ruining things.” “You signed a form.” It’s hard enough to
respond with “This isn’t the job I signed up for.” It’s that much harder
when the fine print reveals that this is what you signed up for.
Compliance increases when guilt is diffused—even if I hadn’t done
it, it still would have happened.77 Statistical guilt. This is why,
historically, people were not executed with five shots fired from one gun.
Instead there were five guns fired simultaneously—a firing squad. Firing
squads traditionally took the diffusion of responsibility a step further,
where one member was randomly given a blank instead of a real bullet.
That way, a shooter could shift from the comforting irrationality that “I
only one fifth killed him” to the even better “I may not even have shot
him.” This tradition was translated into modern execution technology.
Lethal injection machines used in prison executions come with a dual
control system—two syringes, each filled with a lethal dose, two
separate delivery systems, two buttons pressed simultaneously by two
different people—at which point a random binary generator would
secretly determine which syringe was emptied into a bucket and which
into a human. And then the record would be erased, allowing each
person to think, “Hey, I may not even have given him any drug.”
