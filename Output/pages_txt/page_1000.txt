* My own personal experience with extreme essentialism: During 1976 and 1977 the New York City area was terrorized by
the string of “Son of Sam” murders (I was home from college in Brooklyn during the summer of 1977 and can attest that the
psychological impact of the murder spree was enormous). In August 1977 it ended with the arrest of David Berkowitz, a
twenty-three-year-old petty criminal and arsonist who claimed that he killed under the command of a neighbor’s dog, said
dog ostensibly being demonically possessed. A month later, back at college, the phone rang. My roommate answered and
handed me the phone, looking a bit puzzled. “It’s your mother; she seems kind of excited.” “Hi, Mom, what’s new?” And in a
euphoric, relieved, triumphant tone, she shouted: “David Berkowitz! He’s adopted. Adopted! HE’S NOT REALLY
JEWISH!” Ironic ending department for my mother: The biological mother of Berkowitz, born Richard David Falco, was
Jewish. As was his biological father, who was not Falco.
