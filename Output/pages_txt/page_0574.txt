bludgeoned their Tutsi neighbors, friends, spouses, business partners,
patients, teachers, students. Tutsis were beaten with sticks until they
were dead, killed with machetes after being gang-raped and sexually
mutilated, trapped in sanctuaries that were then burned to the ground. An
average of roughly ten thousand people per day. As perhaps the
genocide’s single most shocking atrocity, in the town of Nyange, the
local Catholic priest, a Hutu named Athanase Seromba, gave sanctuary
to between 1,500 and 2,000 Tutsi, many of them his parishioners, and
then led the Hutu militia that ultimately killed every person inside his
church. Rivers ran red, not just metaphorically.*
How could this have happened? There are many components to the
answer. The populace had a long tradition of unquestioning obedience to
authority, a helpful trait to develop in a brutally dictatorial nation. Hutu
militants had for months before been distributing machetes to the Hutu
populace. The government-controlled radio station (the main form of
mass media in this marginally literate country) proclaimed that the intent
of the invading Tutsi rebels was to kill every Hutu, and that one’s Tutsi
neighbors were a fifth column preparing to join in. And there was
another meaningful factor. The anti-Tutsi propaganda was ceaselessly
dehumanizing, with the infamous pseudospeciation of Tutsis being
referred to only as “cockroaches.” Stamp out the cockroaches. The
cockroaches are planning to kill your children. The cockroaches [the
supposedly devious and seductive Tutsi women] will steal your
husbands. The cockroaches [Tutsi men] will rape your wives and
daughters. Stamp out the cockroaches, save yourselves, kill the
cockroaches. And with insular cortices ablaze, machetes in one hand and
transistor radios in the other, most Hutus did.*
