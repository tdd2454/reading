* Just consider what is inherent in the fact that numerous languages worldwide have grammatical genders, with some nouns
designated as masculine, others as feminine. The cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky has shown how grammatical gender can
influence thought. In one study she showed that German speakers tend to associate the word “bridge” (which is feminine in
German) with attributes such as “beautiful,” “elegant,” or “slender,” while Spanish speakers (for whom “bridge” is
masculine) tend toward associations with “big,” “strong,” “towering,” and “sturdy.”
