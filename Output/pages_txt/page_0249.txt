appropriate to say things like characteristic A is more influenced by
nature than nurture than . . . to say that the area of a rectangle is more
influenced by its length than its width.” It’s appropriate to figure out if
lengths or widths explain more of the variability in a population of
rectangles. But not in individual ones.

As we conclude part 2 of this chapter, some key points:
a. A gene’s influence on the average value of a trait (i.e.,
whether it is inherited) differs from its influence on
variability of that trait across individuals (its
heritability).
b. Even in the realm of inherited traits—say, the
inheritance of five fingers as the human average—you
can’t really say that there is genetic determination in the
classically hard-assed sense of the word. This is because
the inheritance of a gene’s effect requires not just
passing on the gene but also the context that regulates
the gene in that manner.
c. Heritability scores are relevant only to the environments
in which the traits have been studied. The more
environments you study a trait in, the lower the
heritability is likely to be.
d. Gene/environment interactions are ubiquitous and can
be dramatic. Thus, you can’t really say what a gene
“does,” only what it does in the environments in which
it’s been studied.
Current research actively explores gene/environment interactions.37
How’s this for fascinating: Heritability of various aspects of cognitive
development is very high (e.g., around 70 percent for IQ) in kids from
high–socioeconomic status (SES) families but is only around 10 percent
in low-SES kids. Thus, higher SES allows the full range of genetic
influences on cognition to flourish, whereas lower-SES settings restrict
them. In other words, genes are nearly irrelevant to cognitive
development if you’re growing up in awful poverty—poverty’s adverse
effects trump the genetics.* Similarly, heritability of alcohol use is lower
