FOOLS RUSH IN: APPLYING THE
FINDINGS OF THE SCIENCE OF
MORALITY
H
ow can the insights we already have in hand be used to foster the
best of our behaviors and lessen the worst?
Which Dead White Male Was Right?

yourself afterward, etc.
Deontology, with its emphasis on the act: because it’s not okay to
steal.
Consequentialism, with its emphasis on the outcome: what if
everyone started acting that way, think about the impact on the person
whose money you’ve stolen, etc.

years, having acquired a quaint veneer of antiquarian fretting over how
an improper act tarnishes one’s soul. As we’ll see, I think that virtue
ethics returns through the back door with considerable relevance.
By focusing on deontology versus consequentialism, we are back on
the familiar ground of whether ends justify means. For deontologists the
answer is “No, people can never be pawns.” For the consequentialist the
answer is “Yes, for the right outcome.” Consequentialism comes in a
number of stripes, taken seriously to varying degrees, depending on its
