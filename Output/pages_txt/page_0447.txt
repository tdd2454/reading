OH, WHY NOT TAKE THIS ONE ON?
POLITICS AND POLITICAL
ORIENTATIONS
S
o humans keep getting weirder—multiple hierarchies and having
leaders and occasionally choosing them and doing so with some
silly, implicit criteria. Now let’s plunge into politics.
Frans de Waal introduced the term “politics” into primatology with
his classic book Chimpanzee Politics, using it in the sense of
“Machiavellian intelligence”—nonhuman primates struggling in socially
complex manners to control access to resources. The book documents
chimpanzee genius for such maneuvering.
This is “politics” in the traditional human sense as well. But I will
use a more restricted, starry-eyed sense, which is politics being the
struggle among the powerful with differing visions of the common good.
Forget liberals accusing conservatives of waging war on the poor. Ditto
conservatives accusing those depraved liberals of destroying family
values. Cutting through this posturing, we’ll assume that everyone
equally desires that people do as well as possible, but differs as to how
best to accomplish this. In this section we’ll focus on three issues:
a. Do political orientations tend to be internally consistent
(e.g., do people’s opinions about their town’s littering
policy and about military actions in Somewhere-istan
come as an ideological package)? Quick answer:
usually.
b. Do such consistent orientations arise from deep, implicit
factors with remarkably little to do with specific
political issues? Yup.
c. Can one begin to detect the bits of biology underlying
these factors? Of course.
