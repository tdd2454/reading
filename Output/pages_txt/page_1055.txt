* !Kung speak a click language, with the exclamation mark in their name the notation for the click sound. Informally known
as “Bushmen,” they are part of the larger cultural group of Khoisan San found in Botswana, Namibia, Angola, and South
Africa. As orientation, the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy featured the !Kung. Of note, while “!Kung” is the most familiar
term most often used for these people, both they and most contemporary anthropologists use the term “Ju/’hoansi” instead.
