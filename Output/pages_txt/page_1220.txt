* Thompson radioed fellow helicopter pilots to evacuate survivors to hospitals; Andreotta waded through the dead in the
ditch to rescue a miraculously unharmed four-year-old. Thompson reported what he had seen to his commanding officers,
who sent word of the events further up the chain. As a result, the senior officer who had commanded the search-and-destroy
mission canceled the ones planned for subsequent days in neighboring villages and began the process of covering up what
had occurred. Andreotta was dead within three weeks, killed in battle. Colburn and, even more so, Thompson, attempted to
inform every military, governmental, and media source available about the events and played key roles in making the My Lai
Massacre public. Representative Mendel Rivers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, attempted to block the
prosecution of Calley and to have Thompson prosecuted instead as a traitor; Thompson testified against Calley at his trial and
received death threats for years. It took thirty years for him and Colburn to be honored by the military for their actions.
Thompson died in 2006, with Colburn at his bedside.
