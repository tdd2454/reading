* An example of the sort of complexity we’re up against here: Both fear conditioning and fear extinction involve activation
of inhibitory neurons. Hmm, that commonality seems weird, given opposite outcomes. It turns out that extinction involves
activation of neurons that inhibit excitatory neurons, while fear conditioning involves activation of inhibitory neurons that
inhibit other inhibitory neurons that project onto excitatory neurons. A double negative, equaling a positive.
