“visual booby-trap” set off by thought, and that “this sense of slippage
between image and object is one of the sources of modernist disquiet.”4
Magritte’s goal was to magnify and play with the distance between
an object and its representation; these are coping mechanisms against
that modernist disquiet. But for that human putting pigment to wall in
Lascaux Cave more than seventeen thousand years ago, the point was the
opposite: to minimize the distance between the two, to be as close as
possible to possessing the real horse. As we say, to capture its likeness.
To gain its power, as imbued in a symbol.
The clearest human mastery of symbolism comes with our use of
language. Suppose you are being menaced by something and thus scream
your head off. Someone listening can’t tell if the blood-curdling “Aiiiii!”
is in response to an approaching comet, suicide bomber, or Komodo
dragon. It just means that things are majorly not right; the message is the
meaning. Most animal communication is about such present-tense
emotionality.
Symbolic language brought huge evolutionary advantages. This can
be seen even in the starts of symbolism of other species. When vervet
monkeys, for instance, spot a predator, they don’t generically scream.
They use distinct vocalizations, different “protowords,” where one
means “Predator on the ground, run up the tree!” and another means
“Predator in the air, run down the tree!” Evolving the cognitive capacity
