As we’ve seen, cooperators outcompete more numerous
noncooperators to the extent that the former can find one another. This is
the logic behind green beards facilitating finding a kindred soul (if not
kin). Thus, when that element is introduced into a game (with the ability
to refuse to play with someone), cooperation soars, and more cheaply

These findings reveal numerous theoretical routes for fostering
cooperation, and with real-life equivalents; moreover, we’ve learned a lot
about which work best when. This is how we’ve evolved to collectively

“Once I calmed down, I thought a bit. To be honest, I probably
should have shared some food with him. And while he definitely crossed

real bite. So I’m feeling kind of bad. And besides, we work well together
on patrols—it’s probably good if we sort things out.
