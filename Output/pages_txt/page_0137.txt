open; some sodium flows in, causing a blip of excitation, which then
spreads.
Glutamate signaling works in a fancier way that is essential to
learning.2 To simplify considerably, while dendritic spines typically
contain only one type of receptor, those responsive to glutamate contain
two. The first (the “non-NMDA”) works in a conventional way—for
every little smidgen of glutamate binding to these receptors, a smidgen
of sodium flows in, causing a smidgen of excitation. The second (the
“NMDA”) works in a nonlinear, threshold manner. It is usually
unresponsive to glutamate. It’s not until the non-NMDA has been
stimulated over and over by a long train of glutamate release, allowing
enough sodium to flow in, that this activates the NMDA receptor. It
suddenly responds to all that glutamate, opening its channels, allowing
an explosion of excitation.
This is the essence of learning. The lecturer says something, and it
goes in one ear and out the other. The factoid is repeated; same thing. It’s
repeated enough times and—aha!—the lightbulb goes on and suddenly
you get it. At a synaptic level, the axon terminal having to repeatedly
release glutamate is the lecturer droning on repetitively; the moment
when the postsynaptic threshold is passed and the NMDA receptors first
activate is the dendritic spine finally getting it.
