signaling.

Now to put in a flabbergasting real number—your average neuron has
about ten thousand dendritic spines and about the same number of axon
terminals. Factor in a hundred billion neurons, and you see why brains,
rather than kidneys, write poetry.
Just for completeness, here are a couple of final facts. Neurons have
some additional tricks, at the end of an action potential, to enhance the
contrast between nothing to say/something to say even more, two means
of ending the action potential really fast and dramatically: something
called delayed rectification and another thing called the hyperpolarized
refractory period. Another minor detail from that diagram above—a type
of glial cell wraps around an axon, forming a layer of insulation called a
myelin sheath; this “myelination” causes the action potential to shoot
down the axon faster.
And one final detail of great future importance: the threshold of the
axon hillock can change over time, thus changing the neuron’s
excitability. What things change thresholds? Hormones, nutritional state,
experience, and other factors filling this book’s pages.
We’ve now made it from one end of a neuron to the other. How
exactly does a neuron with an action potential communicate its excitation
to the next neuron in line?
TWO NEURONS AT A TIME: SYNAPTIC
COMMUNICATION
S
o an action potential has been triggered at the hillock in neuron A
and has swept down to all ten thousand axon terminals. How is this
excitation passed on to the next neuron(s)?
