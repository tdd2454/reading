Thus we’ve got the brain divided into three functional buckets, with
the usual advantages and disadvantages of categorizing a continuum. The
biggest disadvantage is how simplistic this is. For example:
a. Anatomically there is considerable overlap among the
three layers (for example, one part of the cortex can best
be thought of as part of layer 2; stay tuned).
b. The flow of information and commands is not just top
down, from layer 3 to 2 to 1. A weird, great example
explored in chapter 15: if someone is holding a cold
drink (temperature is processed in layer 1), they’re more
likely to judge someone they meet as having a cold
personality (layer 3).
c. Automatic aspects of behavior (simplistically, the
purview of layer 1), emotion (layer 2), and thought
(layer 3) are not separable.
d. The triune model leads one, erroneously, to think that
evolution in effect slapped on each new layer without
any changes occurring in the one(s) already there.
Despite these drawbacks, which MacLean himself emphasized, this
model will be a good organizing metaphor for us.
