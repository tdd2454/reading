T
his completes our introduction to the nervous system and its role in
pro- and antisocial behaviors. It was organized around three
themes: the hub of fear, aggression, and arousal centered in the
amygdala; the hub of reward, anticipation, and motivation of the
dopaminergic system; and the hub of frontal cortical regulation and
restraint of behavior. Additional brain regions and neurotransmitters will
be introduced in subsequent chapters. Amid this mountain of
information, be assured that the key brain regions, circuits, and
neurotransmitters will become familiar as the book progresses.
Hang on. So what does this all mean? It’s useful to start with three
things that this information doesn’t mean:
1. First, there’s the lure of needing neurobiology to
confirm the obvious. Someone claims that, for example,
their crappy, violent neighborhood leaves them so
anxious that they can’t function effectively. Toss them in
a brain scanner and flash pictures of various
neighborhoods; when their own appears, the amygdala
explodes into activity. “Ah,” it is tempting to conclude,
“we’ve now proven that the person really does feel
frightened.”
It shouldn’t require neuroscience to validate
someone’s internal state. An example of this
fallacy was reports of atrophy of the hippocampus in
combat vets suffering from PTSD; this was in
accord with basic research (including from my lab)
showing that stress can damage the hippocampus.
The hippocampal atrophy in PTSD got a lot of play
in Washington, helping to convince skeptics that
PTSD is an organic disorder rather than neurotic
malingering. It struck me that if it took brain scans
to convince legislators that there’s something
