axon terminal projection on to neuron B. But not to a normal place, a
dendritic spine. Instead its axon terminal synapses onto the axon terminal
of neuron B.
What’s up with this? Neuron A releases the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA, which floats across that “axoaxonic” synapse
and binds to receptors on that side of neuron B’s axon terminal. And
such an inhibitory effect (i.e., making that –70 mV resting potential even
more negative) snuffs out any action potential hurtling down that branch
of the axon, keeps it from getting to the very end and releasing
neurotransmitter; in the jargon of the field, neuron A is having a
neuromodulatory effect on neuron B.
Sharpening a Signal over Time and Space
Now for a new type of circuitry. To accommodate this, I’m using a
simpler way of representing neurons. As diagrammed, neuron A sends
all of its axonal projections to neuron B and releases an excitatory
neurotransmitter, symbolized by the plus sign. The circle in neuron B
represents the cell body plus all the dendritic branches.
Now consider the next circuit. Neuron A stimulates neuron B, as
usual. In addition, it also stimulates neuron C. This is routine, with
neuron A splitting its axonal projections between the two target cells,
exciting both. And what does neuron C do? It sends an inhibitory
projection back onto neuron A, forming a negative feedback loop. Back
to the brain loving contrasts, energetically screaming its head off when it
has something to say, and energetically being silent otherwise. This is a
more macro level of the same. Neuron A fires off a series of action
potentials. What better way to energetically communicate that it’s all
over than to become majorly silent, thanks to the feedback loop? It’s a
means of sharpening a signal over time.* And note that neuron A can
“determine” how powerful that negative feedback signal will be by how
many of the ten thousand axon terminals it shunts toward neuron C
instead of B.
