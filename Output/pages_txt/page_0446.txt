Scientists doing these studies often speculate as to why such
preferences have evolved; frankly, much of this feels like just-so stories.
For example, in analyzing the preference for leaders with more
masculine faces during war, the authors noted that high testosterone
levels produce both more masculine facial features (generally true) and
more aggressive behavior (not true, back to chapter 4), and that
aggressiveness is what you want in a leader during times of war
(personally, not so sure about that one). Thus, preferring candidates with
more masculine faces increases the odds of landing the aggressive leader
you need to triumph in war. And everyone then passes on more copies of
their genes. Voilà.
Regardless of causes, the main point is the power of these forces—
five-year-olds with 71 percent accuracy demonstrate that these are some
very generalized, deeply entrenched biases. And then our conscious
cognitions play catch-up to make our decision seems careful and wise.
