* More info for aficionados: The suppression of immunity and inflammation during chronic stress is caused by
glucocorticoids. This is the reason why glucocorticoids are used to suppress the immune system in people with an overactive
immune system (i.e., an autoimmune disease), to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ, or to suppress an overactive
inflammatory response. This is what happens when people are put on immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory “steroids” like
cortisone or prednisone (two synthetic glucocorticoids).
