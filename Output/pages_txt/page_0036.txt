Second, brains obviously have left and right sides, or “hemispheres,”
that roughly mirror each other.
Thus, except for the relatively few midline structures, brain regions
come in pairs (a left and right amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe,
and so on). Functions are often lateralized, such that the left and right
hippocampi, for example, have different but related functions. The
greatest lateralization occurs in the cortex; the left hemisphere is
analytical, the right more involved in intuition and creativity. These
contrasts have caught the public fancy, with cortical lateralization
exaggerated by many to an absurd extent, where “left brain”–edness has
the connotation of anal-retentive bean counting and “right brain”–edness
is about making mandalas or singing with whales. In fact the functional
differences between the hemispheres are generally subtle, and I’m
mostly ignoring lateralization.
We’re now ready to examine the brain regions most central to this
book, namely the amygdala, the frontal cortex, and the
mesolimbic/mesocortical dopamine system (discussion of other bit-
