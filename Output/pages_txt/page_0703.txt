they’re less accurate because they have only two exemplars each.
So neuron 3 is at the convergent center of this network. And the
fanciest parts of the brain are wired up in a way that resembles this fairy-
tale circuit, writ large—at the same time, neuron 3 is a more peripheral
element in some other circuit sending projections to it (say, a circuitry
that would be drawn perpendicular to this page), neuron 1 is at the very
center of some other network in the fourth dimension, and so on. All of
these neurons are embedded within multiple networks.
What does this produce? The capacity for association, metaphor,
analogy, parable, symbol. To link two disparate things, even from
different sensory modalities. To Homerically associate the color of wine
with the color of the sea, that both “tomato” and “potato” can be
pronounced in two different ways in a song, that a bright red tongue
sticking out can remind you of music by the Stones. It’s why I associate
Stravinsky and Picasso, given that albums (remember those?) of
Stravinsky’s music always seemed to have a Picasso painting on the
cover. And it’s why a rectangular piece of cloth with a distinctive pattern
of colors on it can stand for an entire nation or people or ideology.
A final point. We differ as to the nature and spread of our associative
networks. And extremes of them can produce very interesting things at
times. For example, most of us learned early on to associate something
resembling the following with the concept of “face”:
But then someone comes along whose associate networks of
neuronal projections are broader, more idiosyncratic than everyone
else’s. And they teach the world that this can evoke faceness as well:
