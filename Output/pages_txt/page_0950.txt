* Listing these various factors that “enhance” or “inhibit” neurogenesis glosses over lots of detail. The number of new
neurons that are integrated into circuits reflects (a) the number of new cells that are formed from stem cells in the brain; (b)
the percentage of new cells that differentiate into neurons (as opposed to glial cells); and (c) the rate at which new neurons
survive and form functional synapses. Each of these manipulations—learning, exercise, stress, etc.—targets different steps.
Complicating things further is the fact that not all stressors are equal. If a rodent secretes glucocorticoids because it thinks
there is a predator around and the fight-or-flight sirens are going off, neurogenesis is inhibited. But if it secretes
glucocorticoids while voluntarily running in a running wheel, it enhances neurogenesis (in other words, the contrast between
“bad” and “good” stress).
