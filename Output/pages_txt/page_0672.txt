e’ve covered lots of ground, and some themes have arisen
repeatedly. It’s worth reviewing them before considering two
final points.
As the single most important of them, virtually every scientific fact
presented in this book concerns the average of what’s being measured.
There is always variation, and it’s often the most interesting thing about
a fact. Not every person activates the amygdala when seeing the face of a
Them; not every yeast adheres to another one bearing the same surface
protein marker. Instead, on the average, both do. Reflecting this, I’ve just
discovered that this book contains variations on “average,” “typically,”
“usually,” “often,” “tend to,” and “generally” more than five hundred
times. And I probably should have inserted them even more as
reminders. There are individual differences and interesting exceptions
everywhere you look in science.
Now, in no particular order:
It’s great if your frontal cortex lets you avoid temptation,
allowing you to do the harder, better thing. But it’s
usually more effective if doing that better thing has
become so automatic that it isn’t hard. And it’s often
easiest to avoid temptation with distraction and
reappraisal rather than willpower.
While it’s cool that there’s so much plasticity in the
brain, it’s no surprise—it has to work that way.
Childhood adversity can scar everything from our DNA
to our cultures, and effects can be lifelong, even
multigenerational. However, more adverse consequences
can be reversed than used to be thought. But the longer
you wait to intervene, the harder it will be.
