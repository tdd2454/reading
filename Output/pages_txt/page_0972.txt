* A recent study adds an important twist to this story. There are the kids with problems with impulse control—“I’m
absolutely going to hold out for two marshmallow”—who then instantly eat that first one. That profile is a statistical predictor
of adult violent crime. In contrast, there are kids with steep time-discounting curves—“Wait fifteen minutes for two
marshmallows when I can have one right now? What kind of fool waits fifteen minutes?” That is a predictor of adult property
crime.
