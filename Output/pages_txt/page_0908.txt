* This is a rich literature showing the subtleties of the human psyche. The winning effect on testosterone is lessened in
circumstances where people feel like they won by luck or where, despite winning, they feel like they underperformed. In
contast, the effect is enhanced among people who went into the competition having the strongest psychological motives for
domination. Finally, testosterone levels can rise robustly in “losers” who nonetheless performed far better than they
anticipated. Thus one might see testosterone levels rise after a marathon in a guy who came in at the back of the pack but is
triumphant because he was sure he was going to drop dead halfway through, and may decline in the guy who comes in third
but was expected to win. We all belong to numerous hierarchies, but some of the most powerful are the ones in our heads
based on our internal standards.
