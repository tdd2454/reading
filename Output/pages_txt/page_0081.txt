tragically, organically damaged in combat vets with
PTSD, then these legislators have some neurological
problems of their own. Yet it required precisely this
to “prove” to many that PTSD was an organic brain
disorder.
The notion that “if a neuroscientist can
demonstrate it, we know that the person’s
problem is for real” has a corollary—the fancier
the neurobiology utilized, the more reliable the
verification. That’s simply not true; for example, a
good neuropsychologist can discern more of what’s
happening to someone with subtle but pervasive
memory problems than can a gazillion-dollar brain
scanner.
It shouldn’t take neuroscience to “prove”
what we think and feel.
2. There’s been a proliferation of “neuro-” fields. Some,
like neuroendocrinology and neuroimmunology, are
stodgy old institutions by now. Others are relatively new
—neuroeconomics, neuromarketing, neuroethics, and, I
kid you not, neuroliterature and neuroexistentialism. In
other words, a hegemonic neuroscientist might conclude
that their field explains everything. And with that comes
the danger, raised by the New Yorker writer Adam
Gopnik under the sardonic banner of “neuroskepticism,”
that explaining everything leads to forgiving
everything.111 This premise is at the heart of debates in
the new field of “neurolaw.” In chapter 16 I will argue
that it is wrong to think that understanding must lead to
forgiveness—mainly because I think that a term like
“forgiveness,” and others related to criminal justice
(e.g., “evil,” “soul,” “volition,” and “blame”), are
incompatible with science and should be discarded.
3. Finally, there is the danger of thinking that neuroscience
supports a tacit sort of dualism. A guy does something
impulsive and awful, and neuroimaging reveals that,
unexpectedly, he’s missing all his PFC neurons. There’s
a dualist temptation now to view his behavior as more
