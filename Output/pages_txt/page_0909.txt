* All these circumstances of testosterone levels rising raises a question: why not just produce higher levels all the time and
save the effort? For one thing, all those androgens are lousy for the cardiovascular system. But more important, they’d get in
the way of various prosocial behaviors. For example, among monogamous birds and rodents, if testosterone levels don’t drop
around the time the female gives birth, the males won’t act paternally. And some similar patterns seem to apply to humans:
Fathers have lower testosterone levels than age-matched, married men without children, and more involved fathers have
lower levels than less involved ones. Moreover, evoking nurturing behavior in men lowers testosterone levels, as does the
birth of a man’s child. And when compared with high-testosterone fathers, those with lower average testosterone levels are
rated as better parents by their partners and have more activation of their reward-related ventral tegmentum when seeing a
picture of their child.
