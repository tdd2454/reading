* And one thing that I’m not going anywhere near is this New Age–y notion: “Of course we have free will. You can’t say that
our behaviors are determined by a mechanistic universe, because the universe is indeterminate, because of quantum
mechanics.” Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a) the consequences of the
subatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don’t ripple upward enough to influence
behavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn’t be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of
behavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a
role in any of this, “Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ‘I don’t know what came over me.’” Except
you wouldn’t actually be able to make that statement, since you’d just be making gargly sounds because the muscles in your
tongue would be doing all sorts of random things.
