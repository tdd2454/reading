YEAH, SURE IT IS: SOCIAL
INTUITIONISM
E
xcept there’s a problem with this conclusion—people often haven’t
a clue why they’ve made some judgment, yet they fervently believe
it’s correct.
This is straight out of chapter 11’s rapid implicit assessments of Us
versus Them and our post-hoc rational justifications for visceral
prejudice. Scientists studying moral philosophy increasingly emphasize
moral decision making as implicit, intuitive, and anchored in emotion.
The king of this “social intuitionist” school is Jonathan Haidt, whom
we’ve encountered previously.6 Haidt views moral decisions as primarily
based on intuition and believes reasoning is what we then use to
convince everyone, including ourselves, that we’re making sense. In an
apt phrase of Haidt’s, “moral thinking is for social doing,” and sociality
always has an emotional component.
The evidence for the social intuitionist school is plentiful:
When contemplating moral decisions, we don’t just activate the
eggheady dlPFC.7 There’s also activation of the usual emotional
cast—amygdala, vmPFC and the related orbitofrontal cortex,
insular cortex, anterior cingulate. Different types of moral
transgressions preferentially activate different subsets of these
regions. For example, moral quandaries eliciting pity
preferentially activate the insula; those eliciting indignation
activate the orbitofrontal cortex. Quandaries generating intense
conflict preferentially activate the anterior cingulate. Finally, for
acts assessed as equally morally wrong, those involving
nonsexual transgression (e.g., stealing from a sibling) activate
the amygdala, whereas those involving sexual transgressions
(e.g., sex with a sibling) also activate the insula.*
Moreover, when such activation is strong enough, we also
activate the sympathetic nervous system and feel arousal—and
