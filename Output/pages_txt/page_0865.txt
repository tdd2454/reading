* Just to bring some specificity into it, the precise pattern of which subregions of the hypothalamus and which autonomic
relay nuclei are activated can vary with the type of stimulus—thus the fear and aggression associated with responding to a
predator are somewhat different from those in response to the menace of a member of one’s own species; similarly, the
pattern of response in a rodent to the smell of a cat is a bit different from the response to a cat itself.
