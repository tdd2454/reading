* Examples of “good alien” movies include The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977),
Cocoon (1985), Avatar (2009), and, of course, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Meanwhile, the numerous “bad alien”
movies include The Blob (1958), Liquid Sky (1982), Devil Girl from Mars (1954), and, naturally, Alien (1979). The bad/good
alien ratio is consistent over the decades (in other words, it’s not the case that the 1950s were disproportionately filled with
scary alien movies so that the directors weren’t called by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and the 1960s filled
with good-alien efforts of stoned directors just back from Kathmandu). I thank Katrina Hui, a student research assistant, who
did this analysis.
