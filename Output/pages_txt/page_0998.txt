* Note: This does not mean that every neuron in the frontal cortex had the regulation of a thousand-odd genes changed.
Instead, there are glial cells in addition to neurons, and the neurons are of a variety of types. So in reality the average number
of changes within any given cell was probably far less than a thousand. Note about note: which doesn’t make any of this less
interesting, just harder to study.
