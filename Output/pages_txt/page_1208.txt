* Cars may soon be entering discussions of moral decision making—when having to do one or the other, should a self-
driving car smash itself into a wall, killing the passenger, in order to save five pedestrians? Most people think that is how
such cars should be programmed but, predictably, would prefer that one that they used make the opposite choice. Perhaps
more expensive models will work that way, while the hoi polloi have more utilitarian cars. Or maybe the car will decide,
based on how frequently you clean it and change its oil.
