* To help keep “dlPFC” and “vmPFC” straight, I’ll constantly refer to their falsely dichotomized functions, just as a reminder
—“the cognitive dlPFC” and “the emotional vmPFC.” Or here’s a mnemonic—“dl” of the cognitive dlPFC standing for
“deliberative,” the “vm” of the emotional vmPFC as “very (e)motional.” Lame, but it’s saved me on a few occasions.
