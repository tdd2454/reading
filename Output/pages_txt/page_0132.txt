SOME IMPORTANT DEBUNKING:
ALCOHOL
N
o review of the biological events in the minutes to hours prior to a
behavior can omit alcohol. As everyone knows, alcohol lessens
inhibitions, making people more aggressive. Wrong, and in a familiar
way—alcohol only evokes aggression only in (a) individuals prone to
aggression (for example, mice with lower levels of serotonin signaling in
the frontal cortex and men with the oxytocin receptor gene variant less
responsive to oxytocin are preferentially made aggressive by alcohol)
and (b) those who believe that alcohol makes you more aggressive, once
more showing the power of social learning to shape biology.84 Alcohol
works differently in everyone else—for example, a drunken stupor has
caused many a quickie Vegas wedding that doesn’t seem like a great idea
with the next day’s sunrise.
