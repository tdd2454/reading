MANIPULATING THE EXTENT OF
US/THEM-ING
W
hat situations lessen or exacerbate Us/Them-ing? (I define
“lessen” as decreased antipathy toward Thems and/or decreased
perception of the size or importance of contrasts between Us and Them.
Here are some brief summaries, a warm-up for the final two chapters.
The Subterranean Forces of Cuing and Priming
Subliminally flash a picture of a hostile and/or aggressive face, and
people are subsequently more likely to perceive a Them as the same (an
effect that does not occur in-group).67 Prime subjects subliminally with
negative stereotypes of Thems, and you exacerbate Them-ing. As noted
in chapter 3, amygdala activation* in white subjects seeing black faces is
increased if rap music is playing in the background and lessened if music
associated with negative white stereotypes—heavy metal—is played
instead. Moreover, implicit racial bias is lessened after subliminal
exposure to counterstereotypes—faces of popular celebrities of that race.
Such priming can work within seconds to minutes and can persist;
for example, the counterstereotype effect lasted at least twenty-four
hours.68 Priming can also be extraordinarily abstract and subtle. An
example concerned differences in electroencephalographic (EEG)
responses in the brain when looking at same- versus different-race faces.
In the study the other-race response lessened if subjects unconsciously
felt they were drawing the person toward them—if they were pulling a
joystick toward themselves (versus pushing it away) at the time.
Finally, priming is not equally effective at altering all domains of
Them-ing; it is easier to subliminally manipulate warmth than
competence ratings.
These can be powerful effects. And to be more than merely semantic,
the malleability of automatic responses (e.g., of the amygdala) shows
that “automatic” does not equal “inevitable.”
