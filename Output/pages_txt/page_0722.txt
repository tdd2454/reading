Introduction
1. R. Byrne, “Game 21 Adjourned as Thrust and Parry Give Way to Melee,” New York Times,
December 20, 1990.

(2012): 991; and L. Kow and D. Pfaff, “Mapping of Neural and Signal Transduction Pathways
for Lordosis in the Search for Estrogen Actions on the Central Nervous System,” BBR 92
(1998): 169.

5. E. Moniz, quoted in T. Szasz, Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry (Syracuse, NY:
Syracuse University Press, 1988).
6. K. Lorenz, quoted in R. Learner, Final Solutions: Biology, Prejudice, and Genocide
(University Park: Penn State Press, 1992).
7. For discussions of Lorenz’s activities during the Nazi era, see B. Sax, “What is a ‘Jewish
Dog’? Konrad Lorenz and the Cult of Wildness,” Soc and Animals 5 (1997): 3; U. Deichman,
Biologists Under Hitler (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1999); and B. Müller-Hill,

8. The Wellesley effect was first reported by Martha McClintock of the University of Chicago:
M. McClintock, “Menstrual Synchrony and Suppression,” Nat 229 (1971): 244. While a
number of studies have replicated the Wellesley effect, some have not, as summarized in H.
Wilson, “A Critical Review of Menstrual Synchrony Research,” PNE 17 (1992): 565. A
critique of that critique can be found in M. McClintock, “Whither Menstrual Synchrony?”
ARSR 9 (1998): 77.
9. V. S. Naipaul, Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey (New York: Vintage Books, 1992).
And for the definitive book on this entire field of behavioral biology, see M. Konner, The
Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit (New York: Henry Holt, 2003).
This is the finest book in existence on the biology of human social behavior—subtle, nuanced,
nondogmatic, and wonderfully written—by the anthropologist/physician Mel Konner. To my
vast good fortune, Konner was my academic adviser and mentor when I was an undergraduate,
and he has had the greatest intellectual impact on me of anyone in my life. Those who know
Mel will recognize his intellectual imprint on every page of this book.
