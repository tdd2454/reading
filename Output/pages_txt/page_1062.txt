* Note: No one is claiming that a langur monkey is thinking this through, any more than would be some brine shrimp who
has evolved some sort of optimal behavioral reproductive strategy. An animal has the “goal” of “wanting” to pass on copies
of their genes and thus “decides” to do X. This is just shorthand for saying something like “Over the course of millennia,
individuals who do X have passed on copies of their genes at a higher rate, and this has become a common behavioral feature
of this species.” Animals don’t know about evolutionary biology, just as prototypes of airplane wings in a wind tunnel don’t
know about aerodynamics.
