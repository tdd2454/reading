* I recently read in the Kenya Daily Nation about a case that takes one’s breath away, in its challenge not just to kin-selection
thinking but to our notion of what boundaries of inhumanity would never be crossed. In parts of Tanzania there is the
widespread belief that the organs of albinos have magical healing powers, and a shocking number of albino individuals are
murdered there for that purpose. The story reports on a five-year-old albino girl in neighboring Kenya and the plot to smuggle
her into Tanzania to sell her to a shaman to be sacrificed for her organs. The plotters? The girl’s stepfather and father.
