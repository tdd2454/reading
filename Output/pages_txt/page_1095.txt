* By great fortune, I arrived at Harvard as a freshman bio/anthropology major the season when Wilson published
Sociobiology and all hell broke loose. And while it was fantastic, giddying fun for me, watching the fireworks, the personal
nature of the attacks was clearly devastating to some of the principals—for example, protestors at Wilson’s talks regularly
and absurdly chanted about his being a genocidal racist. Those years afforded me the chance to observe some of the players
up close, to even get to know a few of them slightly, and both camps had roughly equal distributions of terrific, admirable
role models and arrogant, insufferable egotists. My favorite story from this period: Many sociobiologists favored a macho,
hard-edged persona. One day I rushed into the office of one of them, Professor X, holding a new paper I had just read. This
guy was famed for a sociobiological model about some behavior, and this paper, by his adversary Professor Z, ripped apart
the model with page after page of statistical analyses. “Wow, did you see this paper? Whaddya think?” I stupidly asked.
Professor X flipped through the paper backward, glancing at the equations now and then. Finally he dismissively tossed the
paper on his desk and delivered the ultimate sociobiological putdown: “Professor Z has a slide rule instead of a penis.”
