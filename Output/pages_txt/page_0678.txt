I have also had the fortune to interact with the spectacular students at
Stanford University, and a number of them have directly contributed to
this book. This has taken the form of their being library assistants,
helping out with specific topics, or being members of a small seminar
that I taught a few times that focused on the content of this book.
They’ve been wonderful to work with and learn from. They are:
