* A recent study shows life-and-death consequences of linguistic cuing. For the same storm intensity, hurricanes arbitrarily
given female names kill more people than do those with male names (names alternate between the two genders). Why?
People unconsciously take male-named hurricanes more seriously and are more likely to comply with evacuation orders. And
this despite both male and female names being selected for their innocuousness—this isn’t comparing Hurricane Mary
Poppins with Hurricane Vlad the Impaler.
