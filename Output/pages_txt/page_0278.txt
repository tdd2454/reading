immigration. Currently, 12 percent of Americans are immigrants, another
12 percent are (like me) children of immigrants, and everyone else
except for the 0.9 percent pure Native Americans descend from people
who emigrated within the last five hundred years.20 And who were the
immigrants? Those in the settled world who were cranks, malcontents,
restless, heretical, black sheep, hyperactive, hypomanic, misanthropic,
itchy, unconventional, yearning to be free, yearning to be rich, yearning
to be out of their damn boring repressive little hamlet, yearning. Couple
that with the second reason—for the majority of its colonial and
independent history, America has had a moving frontier luring those
whose extreme prickly optimism made merely booking passage to the
New World insufficiently novel—and you’ve got America the
individualistic.
Why has East Asia provided textbook examples of collectivism?21
The key is how culture is shaped by the way people traditionally made a
living, which in turn is shaped by ecology. And in East Asia it’s all about
rice. Rice, which was domesticated there roughly ten thousand years ago,
requires massive amounts of communal work. Not just backbreaking
planting and harvesting, which are done in rotation because the entire
village is needed to harvest each family’s rice.* Collective labor is first
needed to transform the ecosystem—terracing mountains and building
and maintaining irrigation systems for controlled flooding of paddies.
And there’s the issue of dividing up water fairly—in Bali, religious
authority regulates water access, symbolized by iconic water temples.
How’s this for amazing—the Dujiuangyan irrigation system irrigates
more than five thousand square kilometers of rice farms near Changdu,
China, and it is more than two thousand years old. The roots of
collectivism, like those of rice, run deep in East Asia.*
