the frontocortical power behind willpower. In a task where one chooses
between an immediate and a (larger) delayed reward, contemplating the
immediate reward activates limbic targets of dopamine (i.e., the
mesolimbic pathway), whereas contemplating the delayed reward
activates frontocortical targets (i.e., the mesocortical pathway). The
greater the activation of the latter, the more likely there’ll be gratification
postponement.
These studies involved scenarios of a short burst of work soon
followed by reward.101 What about when the work required is prolonged,
and reward is substantially delayed? In that scenario there is a secondary
rise of dopamine, a gradual increase that fuels the sustained work; the
extent of the dopamine ramp-up is a function of the length of the delay
and the anticipated size of the reward:

This reveals how dopamine fuels delayed gratification. If waiting X
amount of time for a reward has value Z; waiting 2X should logically
have value ½Z; instead we “temporally discount”—the value is smaller,
e.g., ¼Z. We don’t like waiting.
Dopamine and the frontal cortex are in the thick of this phenomenon.
Discounting curves—a value of ¼Z instead of ½Z—are coded in the
accumbens, while dlPFC and vmPFC neurons code for time delay.102
This generates some complex interactions. For example, activate the
vmPFC or inactivate the dlPFC, and short-term reward becomes more
alluring. And a cool neuroimaging study of Knutson’s gives insight into
impatient people with steep temporal discounting curves; their
