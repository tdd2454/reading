* Studies using this Cyberball paradigm typically have an important control group: The subject is in the same three-way
game of virtual catch when they are told, “Oops, there is a computer glitch. We’ve lost contact with the other two players.
Hang out in there while we fix this.” While things are being “fixed,” the other two players toss the ball. In other words, the
person is left out, but because of technical problems, not for social reasons. And none of those brain regions activate. (Mind
you, if it were me when in a less secure state of mind, it would certainly cross my mind that by the time that computer glitch
was fixed, the other two would have already bonded and realized they were happier without me as part of the game and
would continue to exclude me or, if they started throwing the ball back to me, would be doing so out of sheer condescension,
thereby causing my mesolimbic dopamine system to instantly atrophy.)
