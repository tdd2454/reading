PART 2: GENES FROM THE TOP DOWN—
BEHAVIOR GENETICS
L
ong before anything was known about promoters, exons, or
transcription factors, it became clear that you study genetics top
down, by observing traits shared by relatives. Early in the last century,
this emerged as the science of “behavior genetics.” As we’ll see, the field
has often been mired in controversy, typically because of disagreements
over the magnitude of genetic effects on things like IQ or sexual
orientation.
First Attempts
The field began with the primitive idea that, if everyone in a family
does it, it must be genetic. This was confounded by environment running
in families as well.
The next approach depended on closer relatives having more genes in
common than distant ones. Thus, if a trait runs in a family and is more
common among closer relatives, it’s genetic. But obviously, closer
relatives share more environment as well—think of a child and parent
versus a child and grandparent.
Research grew subtler. Consider someone’s biological aunt (i.e., the
sister of a parent), and the uncle who married the aunt. The uncle shares
some degree of environment with the individual, while the aunt shares
the same, plus genes. Therefore, the extent to which the aunt is more
similar to the individual than the uncle reflects the genetic influence. But
as we’ll see, this approach has problems.
More sophistication was needed.
Twins, Adoptees, and Adopted Twins
A major advance came with “twin studies.” Initially, examining
twins helped rule out the possibility of genetic determination of a
