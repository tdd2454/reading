* I once got a poignant reminder of just how permeating the consequences of lack of privilege are in my professional world. I
was interviewing candidates for a position in my lab. In the process, I’d ask each person about how they handled
interpersonal conflict, looking for people who promptly addressed a social tension, rather than letting it fester into passive-
aggressiveness. I was interviewing a guy whose background was in Queens, rather than the Upper East Side. And when
asked, instead of giving the Upper East Side answer I hoped for (“Yeah, I know how bad things get when you don’t
communicate; I’d be pretty good at just asking the person to be considerate and please return my pipette when they borrow
it”), I got the correct answer from Queens: “Nope, no problems there. I know that a lab is no place for fighting; you take it
outside. You’ve got nothing to worry about with me.”
