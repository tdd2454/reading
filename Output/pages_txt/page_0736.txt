Castration’ for Sex Offenders,” NEJM 336 (1997): 1030. Lack of effectiveness in “hostile”
rapists: K. Peters, “Chemical Castration: An Alternative to Incarceration,” Duquesne
University Law Rev 31 (1992): 307. Broad conclusion that it doesn’t work particularly well: P.
Fagan, “Pedophilia,” JAMA 288 (2002): 2458. I thank Arielle Lasky for excellent assistance
with this research subject.
