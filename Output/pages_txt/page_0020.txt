“A grape lollipop.” I was awed by her savage passive-aggressiveness
—“You’re such a mean, awful human that something must have gone
really wrong in your childhood, and maybe this lollipop will help correct
that just a little.” That guy was going to think twice before screwing with
us again. I swelled with pride and love.
And the second example: In the mid-1960s, a rightist military coup
overthrew the government of Indonesia, instituting the thirty-year
dictatorship of Suharto known as the New Order. Following the coup,
government-sponsored purges of communists, leftists, intellectuals,
unionists, and ethnic Chinese left about a half million dead.9 Mass
executions, torture, villages torched with inhabitants trapped inside. V. S.
Naipaul, in his book Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey, describes
hearing rumors while in Indonesia that when a paramilitary group would
arrive to exterminate every person in some village, they would,
incongruously, bring along a traditional gamelan orchestra. Eventually
Naipaul encountered an unrepentant veteran of a massacre, and he asked
him about the rumor. Yes, it is true. We would bring along gamelan
musicians, singers, flutes, gongs, the whole shebang. Why? Why would
you possibly do that? The man looked puzzled and gave what seemed to
him a self-evident answer: “Well, to make it more beautiful.”
Bamboo flutes, burning villages, the lollipop ballistics of maternal
love. We have our work cut out for us, trying to understand the virtuosity
with which we humans harm or care for one another, and how deeply
intertwined the biology of the two can be.
