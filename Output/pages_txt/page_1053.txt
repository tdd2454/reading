* When Chagnon was a guest lecturer in an anthro class of mine when I was an undergrad, students dressed up as Yanomamö
in a salute to him (hell no, I didn’t—I’m too inhibited); apparently it was standard fare for anthro students to crash his road-
trip lectures that way, which was probably totally irksome after a while, as he’d have to act all surprised and then pose for
pictures with them. Chagnon was at the center of a firestorm of controversy in 2000 when the journalist Patrick Tierney, in
his book Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon, accused Chagnon and a
collaborator of causing a genocidal measles epidemic among the Yanomamö, along with other ethical abuses of them as
research subjects. The American Anthropological Association initially condemned Chagnon, which was generally interpreted
as his being convicted as much for being an abrasive, anti–old boy enfant terrible as for the factuality of the charges.
Eventually both the AAA and independent investigators exonerated Chagnon entirely, showing Tierney’s charges to range
from the sloppy to the fraudulent. Chagnon’s most recent book, a memoir, is entitled Noble Savages: My Life Among Two
Dangerous Tribes—the Yanomamö and the Anthropologists.
