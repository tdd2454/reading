* Goodall, in her chimp fieldwork, reported the case of Flint, the youngest child of the very aged Flo; she never fully weaned
him, and he remained highly dependent on her, even into adolescence. When she died of old age, Flint underwent what can
only be described as a reactive depression, failing to forage or socially interact; he died a month later.
