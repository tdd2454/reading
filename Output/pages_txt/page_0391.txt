Eleven
Us Versus Them
A
s a kid, I saw the original 1968 version of Planet of the Apes. As
a future primatologist, I was mesmerized, saw it repeatedly, and
loved the cheesy ape costumes.
Years later I discovered a great anecdote about the filming of the
movie, related by both Charlton Heston and Kim Hunter, its stars: at
lunchtime, the people playing chimps and those playing gorillas ate in
separate groups.1
As it’s been said (most often attributed to Robert Benchley), “There
are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into
two kinds of people and those who don’t.” There are more of the first.
And it is vastly consequential when people are divided into Us and
Them, in-group and out-group, “the people” (i.e., our kind) and the
Others.
This chapter explores our tendency to form Us/Them dichotomies
and to favor the former. Is this mind-set universal? How malleable are
“Us” and “Them” categories? Is there hope that human clannishness and
xenophobia can be vanquished so that Hollywood-extra chimps and
gorillas break bread together?
