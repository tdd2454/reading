COMPLEXIFICATION
C
hildhood is obviously about increasing complexity in every realm
of behavior, thought, and emotion. Crucially, such increasing
complexity typically emerges in stereotypical, universal sequences of
stages. Most child behavioral development research is implicitly stage
oriented, concerning: (a) the sequence with which stages emerge; (b)
how experience influences the speed and surety with which that
sequential tape of maturation unreels; and (c) how this helps create the
adult a child ultimately becomes. We start by examining the
neurobiology of the “stage” nature of development.
