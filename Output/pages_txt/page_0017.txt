This was Konrad Lorenz, animal behaviorist, Nobel laureate,
cofounder of the field of ethology (stay tuned), regular on nature TV
programs.7 Grandfatherly Konrad, in his Austrian shorts and suspenders,
being followed by his imprinted baby geese, was also a rabid Nazi
propagandist. Lorenz joined the Nazi Party the instant Austrians were
eligible, and joined the party’s Office of Race Policy, working to
psychologically screen Poles of mixed Polish/German parentage, helping
to determine which were sufficiently Germanized to be spared death.
Here was a man pathologically mired in an imaginary bucket related to
gross misinterpretations of what genes do.
These were not obscure scientists producing fifth-rate science at
Podunk U. These were among the most influential scientists of the
twentieth century. They helped shape who and how we educate and our
views on what social ills are fixable and when we shouldn’t bother. They
enabled the destruction of the brains of people against their will. And
they helped implement final solutions for problems that didn’t exist. It
can be far more than a mere academic matter when a scientist thinks that
human behavior can be entirely explained from only one perspective.
