I can’t stay here any longer.” As empathic pain increases, your own pain
becomes your primary concern.
In contrast, the more individuals can regulate their adverse empathic
emotions, the more likely they are to act prosocially. Related to that, if a
distressing, empathy-evoking circumstance increases your heart rate,
you’re less likely to act prosocially than if it decreases it. Thus, one
predictor of who actually acts is the ability to gain some detachment, to
ride, rather than be submerged, by the wave of empathy.
Where do adolescents fit in, with their hearts on their sleeves, fully
charged limbic systems, and frontal cortices straining to catch up? It’s
obvious. A tendency toward empathic hyperarousal that can disrupt
acting effectively.29
This adolescent empathy frenzy can seem a bit much for adults. But
when I see my best students in that state, I have the same thought—it
used to be so much easier to be like that. My adult frontal cortex may
enable whatever detached good I do. The trouble, of course, is how that
same detachment makes it easy to decide that something is not my
problem.
