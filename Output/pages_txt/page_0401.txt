The nature of group membership can be bloodily contentious
concerning people’s relationship to the state. Is it contractual? The
people pay taxes, obey laws, serve in the army; the government provides
social services, builds roads, and helps after hurricanes. Or is it one of
sacred values? The people give absolute obedience and the state provides
the myths of the Fatherland. Few such citizens can conceive that if the
stork had arbitrarily deposited them elsewhere, they’d fervently feel the
innate rightness of a different brand of exceptionalism, goose-stepping to
different martial music.
