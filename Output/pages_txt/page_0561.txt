regions are silent, but the ACC activates. For those neurons, feeling
someone else’s pain isn’t just a figure of speech.
Moreover, the brain intermixes literal and psychic pain.9 The
neurotransmitter substance P plays a central role in communicating
painful signals from pain receptors in skin, muscles, and joints up into
the brain. It’s got pain-ometer written all over it. And remarkably, its
levels are elevated in clinical depression, and drugs that block the actions
of substance P can have marked antidepressant properties. Stubbed toe,
stubbed psyche. Moreover, there is activation of the cortical parts of pain
networks when we feel dread—anticipating an impending shock.
Furthermore, the brain becomes literal when we do the flip side of
empathy.10 It’s painful watching a hated competitor succeed, and we
activate the ACC at that time. Conversely, if he fails, we gloat, feel
schadenfreude, get pleasure from his pain, and activate dopaminergic
reward pathways. Forget “Your pain is my pain.” Your pain is my gain.
