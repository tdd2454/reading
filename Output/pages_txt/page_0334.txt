Evolution sculpts the traits of an organism in two broad ways. “Sexual
selection” selects for traits that attract members of the opposite sex,
“natural selection” for traits that enhance the passing on of copies of
genes through any other route—e.g., good health, foraging skills,
predator avoidance.
The two processes can work in opposition.3 For example, among
wild sheep one gene influences the size of horns in males. One variant
produces large horns, improving social dominance, a plus for sexual
selection. The other produces small horns, which are metabolically
cheaper, allowing males to live and mate (albeit at low rates) longer.
Which wins—transient but major reproductive success, or persistent but
minor success? An intermediate form.* Or consider male peacocks
paying a price, in terms of natural selection, for their garish plumage—it
costs a fortune metabolically to grow, restricts mobility, and is
conspicuous to predators. But it sure boosts fitness via sexual selection.
Importantly, neither type of selection necessarily selects for “the”
most adaptive version of a trait, which replaces all others. There can be
frequency-dependent selection, where the rarer version of two traits is
preferable, or balanced selection, where multiple versions of traits are
maintained in equilibrium.
