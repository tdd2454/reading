this final chapter, we must turn Santayana on his head—those who do
not remember the extraordinary truces of the World War I trenches, or
who do not learn of Thompson, Colburn, and Andreotta, or of the
reconciliative distances traveled by Abe and Fiske, Mandela and Viljoen,
Hussein and Rabin, or of the stumbling, familiar moral frailties that
Newton vanquished, or who do not recognize that science can teach us
how to make events like these more likely—those who do not remember
these are condemned to be less likely to repeat these reasons to hope.
