* An example of this that I found to be excruciatingly uncomfortable: I used to play in a regular pickup soccer game at
Stanford. I was terrible, which was widely and tolerantly recognized by all. One of the best, most respected players was a
Guatemalan guy who happened to be a janitor in my building. At soccer he’d call me Robert (on the rare occasion when
anything I did was relevant to play). And when he came to empty the garbage from my office and lab, no matter how much I
tried to get him to stop, it would be “Dr. Sapolsky.”
