* This arms race is revealed in two classes of diseases. Normal development represents a balancing of paternally derived
progrowth genes and maternally derived ones doing the opposite. What if there is a mutation in a paternally derived
imprinted gene, removing it from the equation? The counteracting maternal genes, unopposed, greatly inhibit fetal growth,
and the fetus doesn’t implant. And what if the opposite occurs, with a mutation incapacitating the female gene, leaving the
progrowth paternal genes working unopposed? Out-of-control growth of the placenta, resulting in an aggressive cancer,
choriocarcinoma.
