* The unique feature of the eusocial insect genetic system is that a sterile worker passes on more copies of her genes by
helping the queen to reproduce than by reproducing herself. Meanwhile, the eusocial insect world has been shaken up by the
fact that in some species (e.g., termites) there is a more conventional genetic system in place. People are still sorting that one
out.
