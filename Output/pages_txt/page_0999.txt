* The strongest ideological criticisms of genetics have typically been leftist in flavor. Despite that, and to my surprise, the one
study I know of that has examined the subject showed no Left/Right ideological differences in the tendency to attribute
individual differences to genetics. Where they differ concerns what sorts of differences are attributed. Thus right-wing
ideology is more associated with genetic interpretations for race or class differences, while left-wing ideology is more
associative when it comes to sexual orientation.
