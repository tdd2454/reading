* How do you demonstrate object permanence in a preverbal infant? Show a child who is not yet at this stage a stuffie, which
you then place in a box. For her, the stuffie no longer exists. Now take it out, and she thinks, “OMG, where’d that stuffie
come from?” Her heart rate increases. Once the kid masters object permanence, pull the stuffie out of the box and (yawn) “Of
course that’s where you put the stuffie”—no heart-rate increase. Even better: put the stuffie in a box and then pull something
different (say, a ball) out of the box. Pre-object-permanence kid isn’t surprised—the stuffie stopped existing, and the ball just
came into existence. Older kid with object permanence: “Wait, that stuffie turned into a ball!”—heart rate increases.
