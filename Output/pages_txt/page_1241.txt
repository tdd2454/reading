* There are other, rarer types of mutations. One class of them, for example, involves the codon coding for an amino acid
called glutamine being repeated over and over in the gene, even dozens of times, producing what are called “polyglutamine
expansion diseases,” the most famous being Huntington’s disease. They are extremely rare mutations, though.
