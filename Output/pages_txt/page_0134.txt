aggression is facilitated by the presence of androgens in
females and by complex neuroendocrine tricks for
generating androgenic signals in “aggressive,” but not
“maternal” or “affiliative,” parts of the female brain.
Mood and behavioral changes around the time of
menses are a biological reality (albeit poorly understood
on a nuts-and-bolts level); in contrast, pathologizing
these shifts is a social construct. Finally, except for rare,
extreme cases, the link between PMS and aggression is
minimal.
Sustained stress has numerous adverse effects. The
amygdala becomes overactive and more coupled to
pathways of habitual behavior; it is easier to learn fear
and harder to unlearn it. We process emotionally salient
information more rapidly and automatically, but with
less accuracy. Frontal function—working memory,
impulse control, executive decision making, risk
assessment, and task shifting—is impaired, and the
frontal cortex has less control over the amygdala. And
we become less empathic and prosocial. Reducing
sustained stress is a win-win for us and those stuck
around us.
“I’d been drinking” is no excuse for aggression.
Over the course of minutes to hours, hormonal effects
are predominantly contingent and facilitative. Hormones
don’t determine, command, cause, or invent behaviors.
Instead they make us more sensitive to the social
triggers of emotionally laden behaviors and exaggerate
our preexisting tendencies in those domains. And where
do those preexisting tendencies come from? From the
contents of the chapters ahead of us.
