Male baboon giving a (hopefully) intimidating threat yawn.
When viewed without Perkins-colored glasses, the benefits of
hierarchy are individualistic. Interactions that proclaim the status quo
obviously help the upper crust. Meanwhile, for subordinates, better to
not get a shady spot than to not get it after receiving a canine slash. This
is logical in a static, hereditary ranking system. In systems where ranks
change, this caution must be balanced with occasionally challenging
things—because the alpha male may be past his prime and getting by on
bluff.
This is a classic “pecking order” (a term derived from the
hierarchical system of hens). Variations begin. A first concern is whether
there’s actually a hierarchy, in the sense of gradations of rank. Instead, in
some species (e.g., South American marmoset monkeys) there’s the
alpha and there’s everyone else, with fairly equal relations.
In species with gradations, there’s the issue of what a “rank” actually
means. If your rank is number six in a hierarchy, in your mind are
numbers one through five interchangeable guys you’d better kowtow to,
while seven through infinity are undifferentiated peons? If so, it would
be irrelevant to you if numbers two and three, or numbers nine and ten,
were having tensions; rank gradations would be in the eyes of the
primatologist, not the primate.
