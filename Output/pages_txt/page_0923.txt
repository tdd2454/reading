* Think about this: Among typical mammals, when males are terrified, they lose erections. Among hyenas, that’s when they
get one (and when some moth-eaten male has the chance to mate, he’s probably terrified out of his mind). This implies some
very different wiring of the autonomic nervous system, whereby stress promotes rather than inhibits erections.
