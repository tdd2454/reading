* I’ve been mighty interested in the history of the Rwandan genocide. I spent time in Rwanda a few years before it occurred,
looking at mountain gorillas on its border with the Congo. Predictably, pathetically, stupidly, poignantly, something-ly, I came
away thinking of the people there as kind and generous. I assume that most everyone I encountered wound up dead, killers,
and/or refugees. At moments when I wonder why anyone should bother writing a book like this, I taunt myself by thinking,
“Golly gee, if only I’d teamed up with the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to give some lectures in Rwanda about the
biology of pseudospeciation, all of this could have been prevented.”
