Adolescence; or, Dude,
Where’s My Frontal
Cortex?

his chapter is the first of two focusing on development. We’ve
established our rhythm: a behavior has just occurred; what events
in the prior seconds, minutes, hours, and so on helped bring it about? The
next chapter extends this into the developmental domain—what
happened during that individual’s childhood and fetal life that
contributed to the behavior?
The present chapter breaks this rhythm in focusing on adolescence.
Does the biology introduced in the preceding chapters work differently
in an adolescent than in an adult, producing different behaviors? Yes.
One fact dominates this chapter. Chapter 5 did in the dogma that
adult brains are set in stone. Another dogma was that brains are pretty
much wired up early in childhood—after all, by age two, brains are
already about 85 percent of adult volume. But the developmental
trajectory is much slower than that. This chapter’s key fact is that the
final brain region to fully mature (in terms of synapse number,
myelination, and metabolism) is the frontal cortex, not going fully online
until the midtwenties.1
This has two screamingly important implications. First, no part of the
adult brain is more shaped by adolescence than the frontal cortex.
Second, nothing about adolescence can be understood outside the context
of delayed frontocortical maturation. If by adolescence limbic,
autonomic, and endocrine systems are going full blast while the frontal
cortex is still working out the assembly instructions, we’ve just
