behaviorism, and its considerable limitations. The point is that Watson
was pathologically caught inside a bucket having to do with the
environmental influences on development. “I’ll guarantee . . . to train
him to become any type.” Yet we are not all born the same, with the
same potential, regardless of how we are trained.*4
The next quote:
Normal psychic life depends upon the good functioning of brain
synapses, and mental disorders appear as a result of synaptic
derangements. . . . It is necessary to alter these synaptic
adjustments and change the paths chosen by the impulses in their
constant passage so as to modify the corresponding ideas and
force thought into different channels.5
Alter synaptic adjustments. Sounds delicate. Yeah, right. These were
the words of the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, around the time he
was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949 for his development of frontal
leukotomies. Here was an individual pathologically stuck in a bucket
having to do with a crude version of the nervous system. Just tweak
those microscopic synapses with a big ol’ ice pick (as was done once
leukotomies, later renamed frontal lobotomies, became an assembly line
operation).
And a final quote:
The immensely high reproduction rate in the moral imbecile has
long been established. . . . Socially inferior human material is
enabled . . . to penetrate and finally to annihilate the healthy
nation. The selection for toughness, heroism, social utility . . .
must be accomplished by some human institution if mankind, in
default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-
induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has
already accomplished much in this respect. We must—and should
—rely on the healthy feelings of our Best and charge them . . .
with the extermination of elements of the population loaded with
dregs.6
