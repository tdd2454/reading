that mediates epigenetic changes, thereby producing randomly different
patterns of gene silencing. Right, that’s bound to work out swell.
Parachute a transposable genetic element into the middle of some gene,
change a splicing enzyme so that it mixes and matches different exons in
multiple proteins. Both asking for major trouble. Implicit in this is stasis,
a conservatism about evolutionary change—it takes very unique macro
changes during times of very unique challenge to luck out.
Show us some actual rapid change. A final rebuttal from gradualists
was to demand real-time evidence of rapid evolutionary change in
species. And plenty exist. One example was wonderful research by the
Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyaev, who in the 1950s domesticated
Siberian silver foxes.65 He bred captive ones for their willingness to be
in proximity to humans, and within thirty-five generations he’d
generated tame foxes who’d cuddle in your arms. Pretty punctuated, I’d
say. The problem here is that this is artificial rather than natural
selection.
Interestingly, the opposite has occurred in Moscow, which has a
population of thirty thousand feral dogs dating back to the nineteenth
century (and where some contemporary dogs have famously mastered
riding the Moscow subway system).66 Most Moscow dogs are now
descendants of generations of feral dogs, and over that time they have
