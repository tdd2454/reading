honor. Many a Confederate boy went off to war advised by his mother
that better he come back in a coffin than as a coward who fled.
The result of this all is a long, still-extant history of high rates of
violence in the South. But crucially, violence of a particular type. I once
heard it summarized by a Southern studies scholar describing the
weirdness of leaving the rural South to start grad school in a strange
place, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where families would get together at
Fourth of July picnics and no one would shoot each other. Nisbett and
Dov Cohen have shown that the high rates of violence, particularly of
murder, by white Southern males are not features of large cities or about
attempts to gain material goods—we’re not talking liquor store stickups.
Instead the violence is disproportionately rural, among people who know
each other, and concerns slights to honor (that sleazebag cousin thought
it was okay to flirt with your wife at the family reunion, so you shot
him). Moreover, Southern juries are atypically forgiving of such acts.30
