* Nauta was not only a towering scientist but also a force of integrity, as well as a renowned teacher who made
neuroanatomy, taught in three-hour evening classes, borderline fun. During college I did research in the lab next to his, and I
was so in awe of the guy that I’d find every possible autonomic excuse to go to the bathroom whenever I saw him heading in
that direction, just for the chance to offhandedly say hello to him by the urinals. (My awe grew further later, with my
discovery that he and his family sheltered Jews from Nazis in Holland during World War II and are cited in the Holocaust
Museum in Washington, DC.)
