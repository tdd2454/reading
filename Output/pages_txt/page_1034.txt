* These are tough studies to pull off, as neuroimaging is a bit of an art in addition to a science, and being able to
quantitatively compare data derived from two scanners and scanning protocols on opposite sides of the globe is challenging.
The alternative—having subjects from both cultures studied in the same scanner—is challenging as well; those aren’t going
to be representative subjects, since half of them are probably international students—connected, well off, and adventurous
enough to be in an American college town, volunteering for a Psych 101 study.
