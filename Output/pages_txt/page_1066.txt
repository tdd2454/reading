* Such fraternal polyandry occurs in resource-poor regions, basically acting as a means to decrease population growth and
prevent family plots from winding up being below subsistance level when subdivided and inherited among all the sons in a
family. Instead, all the brothers are married to the one woman, who has equal sexual access to all of them; the brothers
“believe” that all of them, down to their infant brother, are equally biologically responsible for the children.
