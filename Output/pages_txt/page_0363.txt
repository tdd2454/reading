discovered in a creative synthesis by evolutionary biologist David Haig
of Harvard. Paternal imprinted genes bias toward more fetal growth,
while maternal imprinted genes counter this. For example, some paternal
genes code for potent versions of growth factors, while the maternal
genes code for growth factor receptors that are relatively unresponsive.
A paternally derived gene expressed in the brain makes newborns more
avid nursers; the maternally derived version counters this. It’s an arms
race, with Dad genetically egging on his offspring toward more growth
at the cost of the female’s future reproductive plans, and Mom
genetically countering this with a more balanced reproductive strategy.*
Tournament species, where males have minimal investment in a
female’s future reproductive success, have numerous imprinted genes,
while pair-bonders don’t.42 What about humans? Stay tuned.
