We love the right amount of stress, would wither without it. But back
now to sustained stress and the right side of the inverted U.
Sustained Stress and the Neurobiology of Fear
For starters, sustained stress makes people implicitly (i.e., not
consciously) look more at angry faces. Moreover, during stress, that
sensory shortcut from the thalamus to the amygdala becomes more
active, with more excitable synapses; we know the resulting trade-off
between speed and accuracy. Compounding things further,
glucocorticoids decrease activation of the (cognitive) medial PFC during
processing of emotional faces. Collectively, stress or glucocorticoid
administration decreases accuracy when rapidly assessing emotions of
faces.69
