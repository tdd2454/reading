marmoset monkeys, where the first individual got nothing and merely
chose whether the other guy got a cricket to eat (of note, a number of
studies have failed to find other-regarding preference in chimps).16
Really interesting evidence for a nonhuman sense of justice comes in
a small side study in a Brosnan/de Waal paper. Back to the two monkeys
getting cucumbers for work. Suddenly one guy gets shifted to grapes. As
we saw, the one still getting the cucumber refuses to work. Fascinatingly,
the grape mogul often refuses as well.
What is this? Solidarity? “I’m no strike-breaking scab”? Self-interest,
but with an atypically long view about the possible consequences of the
cucumber victim’s resentment? Scratch an altruistic capuchin and a
hypocritical one bleeds? In other words, all the questions raised by
human altruism.
Given the relatively limited reasoning capacities of monkeys, these
findings support the importance of social intuitionism. De Waal
perceives even deeper implications—the roots of human morality are
older than our cultural institutions, than our laws and sermons. Rather
than human morality being spiritually transcendent (enter deities, stage
right), it transcends our species boundaries.17
