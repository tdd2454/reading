* Although it is fascinating that over the last century, while Scandinavian countries developed their enlightened and far-
reaching system of governmental support of people’s social needs, religiosity there plummeted dramatically; today only a
small minority of Scandinavians are devoutly religious. So religiosity may not be as robust in the future as one would think,
and as we saw in chapter 9, as secular institutions become better at caring for people’s needs, religiosity declines. Probably
more important, this is a good demonstration that religion sure isn’t the only route for highly inclusive in-group prosociality.
