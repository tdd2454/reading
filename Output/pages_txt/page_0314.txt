copies of their genes. This suggested that if you excel at waging it, war
can do wonders for your genetic legacy.
Thus, among these nonstate tribal cultures standing in for our
prehistoric past, nearly all have histories of lethal warfare, some virtually
nonstop, and those who excel at killing are more evolutionarily
successful. Pretty grim.
And numerous anthropologists object strenuously to every aspect of
that picture:62
Again with the cherry-picking. In Pinker’s analysis of
violence among hunter-horticulturalists and other tribal
groups, all but one of his examples come from the
Amazon or the New Guinea highlands. Global surveys
yield much lower rates of warfare and violence.
Pinker had foreseen this criticism by playing the Keeley
pacification-of-the-past card, questioning those lower
rates. In particular he has leveled this charge against the
anthropologists (whom he somewhat pejoratively calls
“anthropologists of peace,” somewhat akin to “believers
in the Easter Bunny”) who have reported on the
remarkably nonviolent Semai people of Malaysia. This
produced a testy letter to Science from this group that, in
addition to saying that they are “peace anthropologists,”
not “anthropologists of peace,”* stated that they are
objective scientists who studied the Semai without
preconceived notions, rather than a gaggle of hippies
(they even felt obliged to declare that most of them are
not pacifists). Pinker’s response was “It is encouraging
that ‘anthropologists of peace’ now see their discipline
as empirical rather than ideological, a welcome change
from the days when many anthropologists signed
manifestos on which their position on violence was
‘correct,’ and censured, shut down, or spread libelous
rumors about colleagues who disagreed.” Whoof,
accusing your academic adversaries of signing
manifestos is like a sharp knee to the groin.63
Other anthropologists have studied the Yanomamö, and
no one else reports violence like Chagnon has.64
