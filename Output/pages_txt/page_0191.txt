me. What majorly predicts a life of
crime? Being born to a mother who,
if she could, would have chosen
that you not be. What’s the most
basic thing provided by a mother?
Knowing that she is happy that you
exist.*26
Harlow also helped demonstrate
a cornerstone of this book, namely
what mothers (and later peers)
provide as children grow. To do so,
he performed some of the most
inflammatory research in
psychology’s history. This involved
raising infant monkeys in isolation,
absent mother or peers; they spent
the first months, even years, of their lives without contact with another
living being, before being placed in a social group.*
Predictably, they’d be wrecks. Some would sit alone, clutching
themselves, rocking “autistically.” Others would be markedly
inappropriate in their hierarchical or sexual behaviors.
There was something interesting. It wasn’t that these ex-isolates did
behaviors wrong—they didn’t aggressively display like an ostrich, make
the sexually solicitive gestures of a gecko. Behaviors were normal but
occurred at the wrong time and place—say, giving subordination
gestures to pipsqueaks half their size, threatening alphas they should
cower before. Mothers and peers don’t teach the motoric features of
fixed action patterns; those are hardwired. They teach when, where, and
to whom—the appropriate context for those behaviors. They give the
first lessons about when touching someone’s arm or pulling a trigger can
be among the best or worst of our behaviors.
I saw a striking example of this among the baboons that I study in
Kenya, when both a high-ranking and a low-ranking female gave birth to
daughters the same week. The former’s kid hit every developmental
landmark earlier than the other, the playing field already unlevel. When
the infants were a few weeks old, they nearly had their first interaction.
