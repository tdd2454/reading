positively than do adults and smaller-than-expected rewards as aversive.
A gyrating top, nearly skittering out of control.
This suggests that in adolescents strong rewards produce exaggerated
dopaminergic signaling, and nice sensible rewards for prudent actions
feel lousy. The immature frontal cortex hasn’t a prayer to counteract a
dopamine system like this. But there is something puzzling.
Amid their crazy, unrestrained dopamine neurons, adolescents have
reasoning skills that, in many domains of perceiving risk, match those of
adults. Yet despite that, logic and reasoning are often jettisoned, and
adolescents act adolescent. Work by Laurence Steinberg of Temple
University has identified a key juncture where adolescents are
particularly likely to leap before looking: when around peers.
