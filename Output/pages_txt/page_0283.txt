PASTORALISTS AND SOUTHERNERS
A
nother important link among ecology, mode of production, and
culture is seen in dry, hardscrabble, wide-open environments too
tough for agriculture. This is the world of nomadic pastoralism—people
wandering the desert, steppes, or tundra with their herds.
There are Bedouins in Arabia, Tuareg in North Africa, Somalis and
Maasai in East Africa, Sami of northern Scandinavia, Gujjars in India,
Yörük in Turkey, Tuvans of Mongolia, Aymara in the Andes. There are
herds of sheep, goats, cows, llamas, camels, yaks, horses, or reindeer,
with the pastoralists living off their animals’ meat, milk, and blood and
trading their wool and hides.
Anthropologists have long noted similarities in pastoralist cultures
born of their tough environments and the typically minimal impact of
centralized government and the rule of law. In that isolated toughness
stands a central fact of pastoralism: thieves can’t steal the crops on
someone’s farm or the hundreds of edible plants eaten by hunter-
gatherers, but they can steal someone’s herd. This is the vulnerability of
pastoralism, a world of rustlers and raiders.
This generates various correlates of pastoralism:26
Militarism abounds. Pastoralists, particularly in deserts, with
their far-flung members tending the herds, are a spawning
ground for warrior classes. And with them typically come (a)
military trophies as stepping-stones to societal status; (b) death
in battle as a guarantee of a glorious afterlife; (c) high rates of
economic polygamy and mistreatment of women; and (d)
authoritarian parenting. It is rare for pastoralists to be pastoral, in
the sense of Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony.
Worldwide, monotheism is relatively rare; to the extent that it
does occur, it is disproportionately likely among desert
pastoralists (while rain forest dwellers are atypically likely to be
polytheistic). This makes sense. Deserts teach tough, singular
