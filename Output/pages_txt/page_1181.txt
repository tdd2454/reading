* I once benefited in a Maimonides-esque scenario when I, sitting on a toilet in a Starbucks, discovered much too late that
there was no toilet paper. Soon someone else entered; hearing him rummaging around one of the urinals, I tentatively begged
for a charitable act—“Uh, hey, when you’re done, could you tell the people at the counter that there is no toilet paper here?”
“Sure,” answered the anonymous voice, and soon a barista’s hand appeared underneath the toilet stall door offering, if not
alms for the poor, TP for the stranded. The trick now is how to re-create this scenario with subjects in brain scanners. This
may not, in fact, have been the perfect anonymous interaction. While the Good Samaritan who carried my message and I
were anonymous to each other, he wasn’t to the baristas. And for all I know, they promptly gave him a free latte or praised
him in song or offered to mate with him. So now we need to know whether the guy expected any/all of these things to happen
when he agreed to help me. More research is needed.
