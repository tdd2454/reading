STAGES

hat stages of child development help explain the good/bad/in-
between adult behavior that got the ball rolling in chapter 1?
The mother of all developmental stage theories was supplied in 1923,
pioneered by Jean Piaget’s clever, elegant experiments revealing four
stages of cognitive development:4
Sensorimotor stage (birth to ~24 months). Thought
concerns only what the child can directly sense and
explore. During this stage, typically at around 8 months,
children develop “object permanence,” understanding
that even if they can’t see an object, it still exists—the
infant can generate a mental image of something no
longer there.*
Preoperational stage (~2 to 7 years). The child can
maintain ideas about how the world works without
explicit examples in front of him. Thoughts are
increasingly symbolic; imaginary play abounds.
However, reasoning is intuitive—no logic, no cause and
effect. This is when kids can’t yet demonstrate
“conservation of volume.” Identical beakers A and B are
filled with equal amounts of water. Pour the contents of
beaker B into beaker C, which is taller and thinner. Ask
the child, “Which has more water, A or C?” Kids in the
preoperational stage use incorrect folk intuition—the
water line in C is higher than that in A; it must contain
more water.
Concrete operational stage (7 to 12 years). Kids think
logically, no longer falling for that different-shaped-
beakers nonsense. However, generalizing logic from
specific cases is iffy. As is abstract thinking—for
example, proverbs are interpreted literally (“‘Birds of a
