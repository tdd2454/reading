d. What this translates into is nonspecificity. For example,
serotonin transporter gene variants have been linked to
risk of depression, but also anxiety, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
Tourette’s syndrome, and borderline personality
disorder. In other words, that gene is part of a network
of hundreds of genes pertinent to depression, but also
part of another equally large and partially overlapping
network relevant to anxiety, another relevant to OCD,
and so on. And meanwhile, we’re plugging away, trying
to understand interactions of two genes at a time.
e. And, of course, gene and environment, gene and
environment.
