TWO SIDE TOPICS
S
o varied types of childhood adversity converge in producing similar
adult problems. Nonetheless, two types of adversity should be
considered separately.
Observing Violence
What happens when children observe domestic violence, warfare, a
gang murder, a school massacre? For weeks afterward there is impaired
concentration and impulse control. Witnessing gun violence doubles a
child’s likelihood of serious violence within the succeeding two years.
And adulthood brings the usual increased risks of depression, anxiety,
and aggression. Consistent with that, violent criminals are more likely
than nonviolent ones to have witnessed violence as kids.*40
This fits our general picture of childhood adversity. A separate topic
is the effects of media violence on kids.
Endless studies have analyzed the effects of kids witnessing violence
on TV, in movies, in the news, and in music videos, and both witnessing
and participating in violent video games. A summary:
Exposing children to a violent TV or film clip increases their odds of
aggression soon after.41 Interestingly, the effect is stronger in girls (amid
their having lower overall levels of aggression). Effects are stronger
when kids are younger or when the violence is more realistic and/or is
presented as heroic. Such exposure can make kids more accepting of
aggression—in one study, watching violent music videos increased
adolescent girls’ acceptance of dating violence. The violence is key—
aggression isn’t boosted by material that’s merely exciting, arousing, or
frustrating.
Heavy childhood exposure to media violence predicts higher levels
of aggression in young adults of both sexes (“aggression” ranging from
behavior in an experimental setting to violent criminality). The effect
typically remains after controlling for total media-watching time,
maltreatment or neglect, socioeconomic status, levels of neighborhood
