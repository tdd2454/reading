but is good enough, given the starting materials. Squid are not great
swimmers compared with sailfish (maximum speed: sixty-eight miles per
hour). But they’re damn good for something whose great-great-
grandparents were mollusks.
Meanwhile, ran the criticism, some traits exist not because they’re
adaptive, or were adapted for something else but got co-opted, but
because they’re baggage carried along with other traits that were selected
for. It was here that Gould and Lewontin famously introduced
“spandrels” in their 1979 paper “The Spandrels of San Marco and the
Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme.” A
spandrel is an architectural term for the space between two arches, and
Gould and Lewontin considered the artwork on the spandrels of the
Basilica San Marco in Venice.*
Gould and Lewontin’s
stereotypical adaptationist would
look at these spandrels and
conclude that they were built to
provide spaces for the artwork. In
other words, that these spandrels
evolved for their adaptive value in
providing space for art. In reality
they didn’t evolve for a purpose—if
you’re going to have a series of
arches (which most definitely exist
for the adaptive purpose of holding
up a dome), a space between each
pair is an inevitable by-product. No
adaptation. And as long as these
spaces were carried along as
evolutionary baggage as a result of
selection for the adaptive arches,
might as well paint on them. In that
view, male nipples are spandrels—they serve an adaptive role in females
and came along for the ride as baggage in males because there’s been no
particular selection against males having them.* Gould and Lewontin
argued that numerous traits that prompted just-so stories from
adaptationists are merely spandrels.
