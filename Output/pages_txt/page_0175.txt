A BRIEF TOUR OF BRAIN
DEVELOPMENT
T
he stages of human brain development make sense. A few weeks
after conception, a wave of neurons are born and migrate to their
correction locations. Around twenty weeks, there is a burst of synapse
formation—neurons start talking to one another. And then axons start
being wrapped in myelin, the glial cell insulation (forming “white
matter”) that speeds up action.
Neuron formation, migration, and synaptogenesis are mostly prenatal
in humans.1 In contrast, there is little myelin at birth, particularly in
evolutionarily newer brain regions; as we’ve seen, myelination proceeds
for a quarter century. The stages of myelination and consequent
functional development are stereotypical. For example, the cortical
region central to language comprehension myelinates a few months
earlier than that for language production—kids understand language
before producing it.
Myelination is most consequential when enwrapping the longest
axons, in neurons that communicate the greatest distances. Thus
myelination particularly facilitates brain regions talking to one another.
No brain region is an island, and the formation of circuits connecting far-
flung brain regions is crucial—how else can the frontal cortex use its few
myelinated neurons to talk to neurons in the brain’s subbasement to
make you toilet trained?2
As we saw, mammalian fetuses overproduce neurons and synapses;
ineffective or unessential synapses and neurons are pruned, producing
leaner, meaner, more efficient circuitry. To reiterate a theme from the last
chapter, the later a particular brain region matures, the less it is shaped
by genes and the more by environment.3
