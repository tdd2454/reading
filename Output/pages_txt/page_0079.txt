This lengthy section has concerned dopamine, but an additional
neurotransmitter, serotonin, plays a clear role in some behaviors that
concern us.
Starting with a 1979 study, low levels of serotonin in the brain were
shown to be associated with elevated levels of human aggression, with
end points ranging from psychological measures of hostility to overt
violence.106 A similar serotonin/aggression relationship was observed in
other mammals and, remarkably, even crickets, mollusks, and
crustaceans.
As work continued, an important qualifier emerged. Low serotonin
didn’t predict premeditated, instrumental violence. It predicted impulsive
aggression, as well as cognitive impulsivity (e.g., steep temporal
discounting or trouble inhibiting a habitual response). Other studies
linked low serotonin to impulsive suicide (independent of severity of the
associated psychiatric illness).107
Moreover, in both animals and humans pharmacologically decreasing
serotonin signaling increases behavioral and cognitive impulsivity (e.g.,
impulsively torpedoing a stable, cooperative relationship with a player in
an economic game).108 Importantly, while increasing serotonin signaling
did not lessen impulsiveness in normal subjects, it did in subjects prone
toward impulsivity, such as adolescents with conduct disorder.
How does serotonin do this? Nearly all serotonin is synthesized in
one brain region,* which projects to the usual suspects—the tegmentum,
accumbens, PFC, and amygdala, where serotonin enhances dopamine’s
effects on goal-directed behavior.109
This is as dependable a finding as you get in this business.110 Until
we get to chapter 8 and look at genes related to serotonin, at which point
everything becomes a completely contradictory mess. Just as a hint of
what’s to come, one gene variant has even been referred to, straight
faced, by some scientists as the “warrior gene,” and its presence has been
used successfully in some courtrooms to lessen sentences for impulsive
murders.
