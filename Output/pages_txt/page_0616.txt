War and Peace
L
et’s review some facts. The amygdala typically activates when
seeing a face of another race. If you’re poor, by the time you’re
five, your frontal cortical development probably lags behind average.
Oxytocin makes us crappy to strangers. Empathy doesn’t particularly
translate into compassionate acts, nor does refined moral development
translate into doing the harder, right thing. There are gene variants that,
in particular settings, make you prone toward antisocial acts. And
bonobos aren’t perfectly peaceful—they wouldn’t be masters of
reconciliation if they didn’t have conflicts to reconcile.
All this makes one mighty pessimistic. Yet the rationale for this book
is that, nonetheless, there’s ground for optimism.
Thus this final chapter’s goals are (a) to evidence that things have
improved, that many of our worst behaviors are in retreat, our best ones
ascendant; (b) to examine ways to improve this further; (c) to derive
emotional support for this venture, to see that our best behaviors can
occur in the most unlikely circumstances; (d) and finally, to see if I can
actually get away with calling this chapter “War and Peace.”
