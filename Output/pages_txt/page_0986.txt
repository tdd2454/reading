* I’ve experienced a manifestation of such parenting in my decades of fieldwork in Kenya, where my nearest neighbors have
been highly un-Westernized members of the Maasai tribe. Sometimes I’d run into someone I hadn’t seen in a while who had
had a baby in the interim, and it took me years to get out of my ridiculous Western reflex—“A new baby! That’s wonderful!
Mazel tov! What’s her name?” Awkward silence—you don’t give a baby a name (or perhaps aren’t willing to utter it) until
she’s survived her first malarial rainy season and hungry dry season.
