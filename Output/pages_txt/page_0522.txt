And then there are distinctions introduced in chapter 6, describing
how much you and your own feelings play into resonating with someone
else’s distress. There’s the emotionally distanced sense of sympathy, of
feeling for someone. There’s the rawer, vicarious state of feeling their
pain as if it were happening to you. And then there is the more
cognitively distanced state of perspective taking, of imagining what this
must be like for her, not you. As we’ll see, an as-if state carries the
danger that you experience her pain so intensely that your primary
concern becomes alleviating your own distress.
Which raises a different word—“compassion,” where your resonance
with someone’s distress leads you to actually help.1
Perhaps most important, these words are generally about inwardly
motivated states—you can’t force someone to truly feel empathy, can’t
induce it in them with guilt or a sense of obligation. You can generate
ersatz versions of it those ways, but not the real thing. Consistent with
that, some recent work shows that when you help someone out of
empathy, there is a very different profile of brain activation from when
you do so out of an obliged sense of reciprocity.2
As usual, we gain insights into the nature and biology of these states
by looking at their rudiments in other species, their development in
children, and their pathological manifestations.
