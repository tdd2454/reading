pain—say, an insect bite. How can you stop the throbbing? Briefly
stimulate the fast fiber. This adds to the pain for an instant, but by
stimulating neuron C, you shut the system down for a while. And that is
precisely what we often do in such circumstances. An insect bite throbs
unbearably, we scratch hard right around it to dull the pain, and the slow,
chronic pain pathway is shut down for up to a few minutes.
The fact that pain works this way has important clinical implications.
For one thing, it has allowed scientists to design treatments for people
with severe chronic pain syndromes (for example, someone with a severe
back injury). Implanting a little electrode into the fast pain pathway and
attaching it to a stimulator on the person’s hip enables the patient to buzz
that pathway now and then to turn off the chronic pain; it works wonders
in many cases.
Thus we have a circuit that encompasses a temporal sharpening
mechanism, introduces the double negative of inhibiting inhibitors, and
is just all-around cool. And one of the biggest reasons why I love it is
that it was first proposed in 1965 by the great neurobiologists Ronald
Melzack and Patrick Wall. It was merely proposed as a theoretical model
—“No one has ever seen this sort of wiring, but we propose that it’s got
to look something like this, given how pain works.” And subsequent
work showed that’s exactly how this part of the nervous system is wired.
Which Guy Is It?
One final, completely hypothetical circuit.
Suppose we have a circuit made of two layers of neurons:
