* Note: not all olfactory kin recognition is based on MHC proteins; there are numerous other sources of an individual
olfactory signature. Note also how this can explain the kin-selection phenomenon mentioned earlier, where sperm form
cooperative swimming aggregates only with sperm from the same individual or a close relative. How to pull this off? Use the
MHC proteins on the surface of the sperm as Velcro—if two sperm have identical proteins (i.e., they’re from the same
person), they aggregate very tightly; close relative, not as tightly but still pretty tightly; more distant relative, less tightly, etc.
