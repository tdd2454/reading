COLLECTIVIST VERSUS
INDIVIDUALIST CULTURES
A
s introduced in chapter 7, a large percentage of cross-cultural
psychology studies compare collectivist with individualist
cultures. This almost always means comparisons between subjects from
collectivist East Asian cultures and Americans, coming from that mother
of all individualist cultures.* As defined, collectivist cultures are about
harmony, interdependence, conformity, and having the needs of the
group guiding behavior, whereas individualist cultures are about
autonomy, personal achievement, uniqueness, and the needs and rights of
the individual. Just to be a wee bit caustic, individualist culture can be
summarized by that classic American concept of “looking out for
number one”; collectivist culture can be summarized by the archetypical
experience of American Peace Corps teachers in such countries—pose
your students a math question, and no one will volunteer the correct
answer because they don’t want to stand out and shame their classmates.
Individualist/collectivist contrasts are striking. In individualist
cultures, people more frequently seek uniqueness and personal
accomplishment, use first-person singular pronouns more often, define
themselves in terms that are personal (“I’m a contractor”) rather than
relational (“I’m a parent”), attribute their successes to intrinsic attributes
(“I’m really good at X”) rather than to situational ones (“I was in the
right place at the right time”). The past is more likely to be remembered
via events (“That’s the summer I learned to swim”) rather than social
interactions (“That’s the summer we became friends”). Motivation and
satisfaction are gained from self- rather than group-derived effort
(reflecting the extent to which American individualism is about
noncooperation, rather than nonconformity). Competitive drive is about
getting ahead of everyone else. When asked to draw a “sociogram”—a
diagram of their social network, with circles representing themselves and
their friends, connected by lines—Americans tend to place the circle
representing themselves in the middle of the page and make it the
largest.13
