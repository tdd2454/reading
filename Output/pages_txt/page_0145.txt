DIGGING DEEPER IN THE ASH HEAP OF
HISTORY

ecall the crude, Neanderthal-ish notion that new memories require
new neurons, an idea discarded when Hebb was in diapers. The
adult brain does not make new neurons. You’ve got your maximal
number of neurons around birth, and it’s downhill from there, thanks to
aging and imprudence.
You see where we’re heading—adult brains, including aged human
brains, do make new neurons. The finding is truly revolutionary, its
discovery epic.
In 1965 an untenured associate professor at MIT named Joseph
Altman (along with a longtime collaborator, Gopal Das) found the first
evidence for adult neurogenesis, using a then-novel technique. A newly
made cell contains newly made DNA. So, find a molecule unique to
DNA. Get a test tube full of the stuff and attach a miniscule radioactive
tag to each molecule. Inject it into an adult rat, wait awhile, and examine
its brain. If any neurons contain that radioactive tag, it means they were
born during the waiting period, with the radioactive marker incorporated
into the new DNA.
This is what Altman saw in a series of studies.18 As even he notes,
the work was initially well received, being published in good journals,
generating excitement. But within a few years something shifted, and
Altman and his findings were rejected by leaders in the field—it couldn’t
be true. He failed to get tenure, spent his career at Purdue University, lost
funding for his adult neurogenesis work.
Silence reigned for a decade until an assistant professor at the
University of New Mexico named Michael Kaplan extended Altman’s
findings with some new techniques. Again this caused mostly crushing
rejection by senior figures in the field, including one of the most
established men in neuroscience, Pasko Rakic of Yale.19
Rakic publicly rejected Kaplan’s (and tacitly Altman’s) work, saying
he had looked for new neurons himself, they weren’t there, and Kaplan
was mistaking other cell types for neurons. At a conference he
