* Not all remapping is logical; some is just plain weird. A few years back, during an extremely stressed period, I developed a
tic—when I’d be acutely upset about something, the second and third fingers on my left hand would rhythmically contract for
a few seconds. What the hell was that about? No idea, but I marvel at the randomness of the remapping, at how unpleasant
tumult in limbic circuitry somehow tapped into this motor circuit.
