“Most people are more prejudiced than they think they are,” before
taking the test with a black tester, performance plummets more than if
they are told, “Most people perform worse [on a frontal cortical
cognitive test] than they think they did.” Moreover, if white subjects are
primed with a command reeking of frontal regulation (“avoid prejudice”
during an interracial interaction), performance declines more than when
they are told to “have a positive intercultural exchange.”65
A different type of executive control can occur in minority Thems
when dealing with individuals of the dominant culture—be certain to
interact with them in a positive manner, to counter their assumed
prejudice against you. In one startling study African American subjects
were primed to think about either racial or age prejudice, followed by an
interaction with someone white.66 When the prime was racial, subjects
became more talkative, solicited the other person’s opinion more, smiled
more, and leaned forward more; the same didn’t occur when subjects
interacted with another African American. Think about chapter 3’s
African American grad student intentionally whistling Vivaldi each
evening on the way home.
Two points are worth making about these studies about executive
control and interactions with Thems:
Frontal cortical activation during an interracial interaction could
reflect: (a) being prejudiced and trying to hide it; (b) being
prejudiced and feeling bad about it; (c) feeling no prejudice and
working to communicate that; (d) who knows what else.
Activation merely implies that the interracial nature of the
interaction is weighing on the subject (implicitly or otherwise)
and prompting executive control.
As per usual, subjects in these studies were mostly university
students fulfilling some Psych 101 requirement. In other words,
individuals of an age associated with openness to novelty,
residing in a privileged place where Us/Them cultural and
economic differences are less than in society at large, and where
there is not only institutionalized celebration of diversity but also
some actual diversity (beyond the university’s home page with
