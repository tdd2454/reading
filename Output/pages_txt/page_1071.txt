* To rein in the length of this chapter, I’ve had to force myself to relegate to this footnote a description of a system of
reciprical altruism found in single-cell amoeba called Dictyostelium discoideum (aka slime mold). In order to reproduce,
individual cells join in a structured colony in which about 80 percent of the cells reproduce and the rest play nonreproductive
supporting roles. When the colony consists of two different genetic lines of amoebas, there is cooperation in that each line
contributes about 20 percent of its cells to the unfun supporting role. Except that lines evolve to try to cheat by sneaking all
their cells into the reproductive pool, and other lines evolve to detect cheaters and refuse to interact with them. For example,
the amoebas express a cell-surface protein “adhesion molecule” that lets cells adhere to one another, forming the colony; an
anticheater mechanism is to express an adhesion molecule that doesn’t recognize (i.e., attach to) the adhesion protein of a
cheater line.
