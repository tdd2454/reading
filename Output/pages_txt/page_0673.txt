Brains and cultures coevolve.
Things that seem morally obvious and intuitive now
weren’t necessarily so in the past; many started with
nonconforming reasoning.
Repeatedly, biological factors (e.g., hormones) don’t so
much cause a behavior as modulate and sensitize,
lowering thresholds for environmental stimuli to cause
it.
Cognition and affect always interact. What’s interesting
is when one dominates.
Genes have different effects in different environments; a
hormone can make you nicer or crummier, depending on
your values; we haven’t evolved to be “selfish” or
“altruistic” or anything else—we’ve evolved to be
particular ways in particular settings. Context, context,
context.
Biologically, intense love and intense hate aren’t
opposites. The opposite of each is indifference.
Adolescence shows us that the most interesting part of
the brain evolved to be shaped minimally by genes and
maximally by experience; that’s how we learn—context,
context, context.
Arbitrary boundaries on continua can be helpful. But
never forget that they are arbitrary.
Often we’re more about the anticipation and pursuit of
pleasure than about the experience of it.
You can’t understand aggression without understanding
fear (and what the amygdala has to do with both).
Genes aren’t about inevitabilities; they’re about
potentials and vulnerabilities. And they don’t determine
anything on their own. Gene/environment interactions
are everywhere. Evolution is most consequential when
altering regulation of genes, rather than genes
themselves.
We implicitly divide the world into Us and Them, and
prefer the former. We are easily manipulated, even
subliminally and within seconds, as to who counts as
each.
