“FOR” VERSUS “AS IF” AND OTHER
DISTINCTIONS
E
mpathy, sympathy, compassion, mimicry, emotional contagion,
sensorimotor contagion, perspective taking, concern, pity. Let the
terminology and squabbles begin over definitions of ways in which we
resonate with someone else’s adversity (along with the question of
whether the opposite of such resonance is gloating pleasure or
indifference).
We start with, for want of a better word, primitive versions of
resonating with someone’s pain. There’s sensorimotor contagion—you
see a hand poked with a needle, and the part of your sensory cortex that
maps onto your hand activates, sensitizing you to the imagined sensation.
Perhaps your motor cortex will also activate, causing you to compress
your own hand. Or you watch a tightrope walker and involuntarily put
your arms out for balance. Or someone has a coughing fit, and your
throat constricts.
Even more explicitly motoric is the act of matching movements with
simple mimicry. Or there’s emotional contagion, the automatic transfer
of strong emotive states—such as one baby crying because another is, or
someone catching the fever of a mob plunging into a riot.
Your resonance with someone’s plight can carry an implicit power
differential. You can pity someone in pain—recalling Fiske’s categories
of Thems in chapter 11, this belittling pity means you view the person as
high in warmth and low in competence and agency. And we all know the
everyday meaning of “sympathy” (“Look, I sympathize with your
situation, but . . .”); you have the power to alleviate their distress but
choose not to.
Then there are terms reflecting how much your resonance is about
emotion versus cognition. In that sense “sympathy” means you feel sorry
for someone else’s pain without understanding it. In contrast, “empathy”
contains the cognitive component of understanding the cause of
someone’s pain, taking his perspective, walking in his shoes.
