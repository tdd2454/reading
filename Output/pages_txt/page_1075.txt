* A particularly clever exploitative strategy is called Pavlov. If you’re playing PD, the most advantageous outcomes for you,
in rank order, are: (a) you defect while the other person is a sucker who cooperates; (b) you both cooperate; (c) you both
defect; (d) you’re the sucker who cooperates while the other defects. Pavlov’s basic temperament is to cooperate, but every so
often, randomly, it defects, and the rule is that, independent of those occasional random actions, if your play resulted in one of
the two better outcomes, you do the same thing again next time; if the result was one of the two worse outcomes, you switch
your behavior the next time. What that means is that if you are playing against Always Cooperate or a highly forgiving
version of Forgiving Tit for Tat, your occasional random defections are either never or rarely punished, allowing you to
exploit the other player at length.
