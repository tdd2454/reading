punishing can be costly to the third party, meaning that there’s the
evolutionary challenge not just of jump-starting cooperation but also of
jump-starting altruistic third-party punishment.31
The answer, as repeatedly derived by humans, is to add layers.
Develop secondary punishment, punishing someone who fails to do
third-party punishment—the world of honor codes, where you’re
punished if you don’t report a violation. An alternative is to reward third-
party punishers—humans make livings as cops and judges. Moreover,
recent theoretical and empirical work shows that being a conspicuous
third-party punisher makes people trust you. But who monitors third-
party punishers? Here is where you get people to share and lower the
cost by taking sociality to the max—costs are shouldered by everyone,
and free riders are punished (e.g., we pay taxes and punish tax evaders).
When the moving parts are balanced, you generate extraordinary levels
of cooperation.32
The moving parts were examined in a fascinating 2010 Science
paper. The authors studied 113,000 online participants, who each
purchased an item (a souvenir photo) under one of the following
conditions:33
a. Could buy for a set price. (This was the control
condition.)
b. Could pay whatever they wanted; sales soared but
people tended to pay tiny amounts, putting the “store” in
the red.
c. Were charged the original price, knowing that the
company gave X percent of earnings to charity; sales
increased, but less than X percent, and the store lost
money.
d. Could pay whatever they wanted, with half of that going
to a charity. This boosted both sales and the price
voluntarily paid, yielding profits for the store and a large
charitable contribution.
In other words, while evidence of corporate social responsibility
(scenario C) boosts sales a bit, it’s far more effective when the individual
