The nervous system is about contrasts, unambiguous extremes
between having something and having nothing to say, maximizing
signal-to-noise ratios. And this is demanding and expensive.*
ONE NEURON AT A TIME
T
he basic cell type of the nervous system, what we typically call a
“brain cell,” is the neuron. The hundred billion or so in our brains
communicate with one another, forming complex circuits. In addition,
there are glia cells, which do a lot of gofering—providing structural
support and insulation for neurons, storing energy for them, helping to
mop up neuronal damage.
Naturally, this neuron/glia comparison is all wrong. There are about
ten glial cells for every neuron, coming in various subtypes. They greatly
influence how neurons speak to one another, and also form glial
networks that communicate completely differently from neurons. So glia
are important. Nonetheless, to make this primer more manageable, I’m
going to be very neuron-centric.
Part of what makes the nervous system so
distinctive is how distinctive neurons are as cells.
Cells are usually small, self-contained entities—
consider little round red blood cells:
Neurons, in contrast, are highly asymmetrical,
elongated beasts, typically with processes sticking
out all over the place:
These processes can be elaborated to nutty
extents. Consider this single neuron, drawn in the
early twentieth century by one of the gods in the
field, Santiago Ramón y Cajal:
It’s like the branches of a manic tree, explaining the jargon that this is
a highly “arborized” neuron.
