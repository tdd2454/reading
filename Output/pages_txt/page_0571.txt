the insula helps get us into heaven, in addition to purging our guts of
toxins. The latter is a case of what has been called “neural reuse.”27
This isn’t to say it’s been an easy process, that magically one day
neurons that help make you puke are suddenly involved in running the
president’s bioethics panel. It is insanely interesting to me that the most
unique neurons in our brains, the recently evolved and slow-developing
von Economo neurons, are predominantly housed in the anterior
cingulate and insula. And that the neurodegenerative disease
frontotemporal dementia, destined to eventually destroy the entire fancy
neocortex, takes out von Economo neurons first—there’s something
extra fancy (and thus expensive and vulnerable) about those cells. The
tinkering and improvising was inspired.
What’s most interesting is that we see the beginnings of the “I know,
let’s persuade the ACC and insula to volunteer for these new jobs” in
other species. As we saw in chapter 14, the emotional contagion and
protoempathy that a rodent can feel for another one in pain is centered in
the anterior cingulate. And full-blown von Economo neurons are also
found in those same brain regions in the other apes, elephants, and
cetaceans—evolution’s Mensa club—and exist in rudimentary forms in
monkeys. It’s unclear if, say, a blue whale wants to wash its flippers after
a social-norm violation, but a handful of other species seem to have
taken the first steps into this strange new territory along with us.
