* The fact that brain injury, such as a stroke, triggers neurogenesis created huge excitement—wow, the brain has a means to
try to repair itself after an injury, how cool is that? What was obvious from the start is that whatever compensatory
neurogenesis there is, there isn’t a ton, since so many neurological insults leave the nervous system an irreparable mess
afterward. But to add insult to injury, work in that area began to show that sometimes the new neurons actually made things
worse, migrating where they shouldn’t, integrating into circuits the wrong way, making those circuits seizure prone. To
metaphorically appropriate a concept from chapter 1, this seems a case of neuronal pathological altruism—beware when
freshly minted neurons that may not yet know feces from Shinola want to lend a helping hand.
