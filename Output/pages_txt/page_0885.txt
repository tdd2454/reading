* In humans activation of the dopaminergic system is typically assessed with functional imaging techniques like fMRI, which
detect changes in metabolism in different parts of the brain. To be precise, while an increase in metabolic demands in these
regions is typically due to neurons there having lots of (dopamine-releasing) action potentials, the two are not synonymous.
Nonetheless, for simplicity I’m using “dopaminergic signaling increases,” “dopamine pathways activate,” “dopamine is
released” interchangeably.
