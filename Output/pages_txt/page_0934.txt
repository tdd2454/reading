* How does the brain pull off an inverted U, where a moderate rise in glucocorticoid levels enhances memory (for example),
while a bigger rise does the opposite? One solution that the brain has evolved is to have two receptor systems for
glucocorticoids. One (the “MR”) is responsive to small increases in glucocorticoid levels above baseline and mediates the
stimulatory effects. The other (“GR”) receptors respond only to big, prolonged increases and mediate the adverse effects.
Predictably, levels of the two types of receptors vary by brain region, person, and circumstance.
