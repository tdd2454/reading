* A quick primer for directions in the brain, for anyone who cares. They come in three dimensions: (1) Dorsal/ventral. Dorsal
= the top of the brain (in the same way that the fin on the top of a horizontal dolphin is the dorsal fin). Ventral = the bottom.
(2) Medial/lateral. Medial = at the midline of the brain, when viewed in cross section. Lateral = as far as possible from the
midline, moving left or right. Thus the “dorsolateral” PFC is the part of the PFC that is on top and to the outside. (3)
Anterior/posterior. At the front or back of the brain. Lateralized brain structures come in pairs—one in the left hemisphere,
one in the right, both at the same place in the dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior planes, but in opposite locations in the
medial/lateral plane.
