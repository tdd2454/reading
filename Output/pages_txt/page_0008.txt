Introduction
T
he fantasy always runs like this: A team of us has fought our way
into his secret bunker. Okay, it’s a fantasy, let’s go whole hog. I’ve
single-handedly neutralized his elite guard and have burst into his
bunker, my Browning machine gun at the ready. He lunges for his Luger;
I knock it out of his hand. He lunges for the cyanide pill he keeps to
commit suicide rather than be captured. I knock that out of his hand as
well. He snarls in rage, attacks with otherworldly strength. We grapple; I
manage to gain the upper hand and pin him down and handcuff him.
“Adolf Hitler,” I announce, “I arrest you for crimes against humanity.”
And this is where the medal-of-honor version of the fantasy ends and
the imagery darkens. What would I do with Hitler? The viscera become
so raw that I switch to passive voice in my mind, to get some distance.
What should be done with Hitler? It’s easy to imagine, once I allow
myself. Sever his spine at the neck, leave him paralyzed but with
sensation. Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument. Puncture his
eardrums, rip out his tongue. Keep him alive, tube-fed, on a respirator.
Immobile, unable to speak, to see, to hear, only able to feel. Then inject
him with something that will give him a cancer that festers and
pustulates in every corner of his body, that will grow and grow until
every one of his cells shrieks with agony, till every moment feels like an
infinity spent in the fires of hell. That’s what should be done with Hitler.
That’s what I would want done to Hitler. That’s what I would do to
Hitler.

I’ve had versions of this fantasy since I was a kid. Still do at times. And
when I really immerse myself in it, my heart rate quickens, I flush, my
fists clench. All those plans for Hitler, the most evil person in history, the
soul most deserving of punishment.
