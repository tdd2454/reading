* Some years ago a game show called Golden Balls ran in Britain. As the final step in a series of competitions, two
competitors would face each other and play a modified version of the PD. There’d be a pot of money (potentially tens of
thousands of pounds); each player would have to independently choose either “Split” or “Steal.” If both chose Split, they split
the money. If one chose Split and the other Steal, the sucker got zero and the defector got everything. If they both chose Steal,
they got nothing. YouTube is full of clips from various episodes, and they’re embarrassingly addictive. Also, see this
