killer, still at large, probably looked pretty much the same.
Keeley and Pinker also document how prehistoric settlements
frequently protected themselves with defensive palisades and
fortifications. And, of course, as the poster child for prehistoric violence,
there is Otzi, the 5,300-year-old Tyrolean “iceman” found in a melting
glacier in 1991 on the Italian/Austrian border. In his shoulder was a
freshly embedded arrowhead.
Thus, Keeley and Pinker document mass casualties of warfare long
predating civilization. Just as important, both (starting with Keeley’s
subtitle) suggest a hidden agenda among archaeologists to ignore that
evidence. Why had there been, to use Keeley’s phrase, “pacification of
