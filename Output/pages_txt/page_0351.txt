Example 2:

Example 3:
You: C C C C C C C C C C D

Example 4:
You: C C C C C C C C C C D C C C. . . .
Her: C C C C C C C C C D C C C C. . . .
If she continues defecting, you do as well:
Example 5:
You: C C C C C C C C C C D D D D D. . . .
Her: C C C C C C C C C D D D D D D. . . .
Suppose you play against someone who always defects. Things look

Example 6:
