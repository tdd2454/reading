Gigantic Question #1: What Strategy for
Cooperating Is Optimal?
While biologists were formulating these questions, other scientists
were already starting to answer them. In the 1940s “game theory” was
founded by the polymath John von Neumann, one of the fathers of
computer science. Game theory is the study of strategic decision making.
Framed slightly differently, it’s the mathematical study of when to
cooperate and when to cheat. The topic was already being explored with
respect to economics, diplomacy, and warfare. What was needed was for
game theorists and biologists to start talking. This occurred around 1980
concerning the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD), introduced in chapter 3. Time
to see its parameters in detail.
Two members of a gang, A and B, are arrested. Prosecutors lack
evidence to convict them of a major crime but can get them on a lesser
charge, for which they’ll serve a year in prison. A and B can’t
communicate with each other. Prosecutors offer each a deal—inform on
the other and your sentence is reduced. There are four possible
outcomes:
Both A and B refuse to inform on each other: each
serves one year.
Both A and B inform on each other: each serves two
years.
A informs on B, who remains silent: A walks free and B
serves three years.
B informs on A, who remains silent: B walks and A
serves three years.
Thus, each prisoner’s dilemma is whether to be loyal to your partner
(“cooperate”) or betray him (“defect”). The thinking might go, “Best to
cooperate. This is my partner; he’ll also cooperate, and we’ll each serve
only a year. But what if I cooperate and he stabs me in the back? He
walks, and I’m in for three years. Better defect. But what if we both
