Us-es and Thems together under very narrow circumstances and
something sort of resembling that happens, but you can also blow it and
worsen things.
Some of those effective narrower circumstances: there are roughly
equal numbers from each side; everyone’s treated equally and
unambiguously; contact is lengthy and on neutral, benevolent territory;
there are “superordinate” goals where everyone works together on a task
they care about (say, the summer campers turning an overgrown meadow
into a soccer field).72
Essentialism Versus Individuation
This harks back to two important earlier points. First, that Thems
tend to be viewed as homogeneous, simple, and having an unchangeable
(and negative) essence. Second, that being forced to think of a Them as
an individual can make them seem more like an Us. Decreasing
essentialist thinking via individuation is a powerful tool.
One elegant study showed this. White subjects were given a
questionnaire assessing the extent of their acceptance of racial
inequalities, after being given one of two primes.73 The first bolstered
essentialist thinking about race as invariant and homogeneous
—“Scientists pinpoint the genetic underpinnings of race.” The other
prime was antiessentialist—“Scientists reveal that race has no genetic
basis.” Being primed toward essentialism made subjects more accepting
of racial inequalities.
Hierarchy
Predictably, making hierarchies steeper, more consequential, or more
overt worsens Them-ing; the need for justification fuels those on top to
pour the stereotypes of, at best, high warmth/low competence or, worse,
low warmth/low competence onto the heads of those struggling at the
bottom, and those on the bottom reciprocate with the simmering time
bomb that is the perception of the ruling class as low warmth/high
competence.74 Fiske has explored how those on top perceiving the
underclass as high warmth/low competence can stabilize the status quo;
the powerful feel self-congratulatory about their presumed benevolence,
