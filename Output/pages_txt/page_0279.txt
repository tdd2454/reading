A fascinating 2014 Science paper strengthens the rice/collectivism
connection by exploring an exception.22 In parts of northern China it’s
difficult to grow rice, and instead people have grown wheat for
millennia; this involves individual rather than collective farming. And by
the standard tests of individualist versus collectivist cultures (e.g., draw a
sociogram, which two are most similar of a rabbit, dog, and carrot?)—
they look like Westerners. The region has two other markers of
individualism, namely higher rates of divorce and of inventiveness—
patent filings—than in rice-growing regions. The roots of individualism,
likes those of wheat, run deep in northern China.
The links between ecology, mode of production, and culture are
shown in a rare collectivist/individualist study not comparing Asians and
Westerners.23 The authors studied a Turkish region on the Black Sea,
where mountains hug the coastline. There, in close proximity, people live
by fishing, by farming the narrow ribbon of land between the sea and the
mountains, or as mountain shepherds. All three groups had the same
language, religion, and gene stock.
Herding is solitary; while Turkish farmers and fishermen (and
women) were no Chinese rice farmers, they at least worked their fields in
groups and manned their fishing boats in crews. Herders thought less
holistically than farmers or fishermen—the former were better at judging
