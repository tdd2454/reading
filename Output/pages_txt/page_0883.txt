* And then there are circumstances where the limbic system overwhelms the frontal cortex, where there is no such thing as a
good decision, where each choice is worse than the other. Think about what is, for a parent, probably the most excruciating
scene in all of cinema—in Sophie’s Choice, when Sophie must make the Choice, when, without warning, she has seconds to
choose which of her two children lives, which dies. Making her bludgeoned, unimaginable choice requires her frontocortical
neurons to send signals to her prefrontal cortex and on to her motor cortex—after all, she eventually says words and moves
her hands, pushing one child forward. And the bidirectionality of the circuitry is shown by the fact that her limbic system, no
doubt, was screaming in agony to the frontal cortex.
