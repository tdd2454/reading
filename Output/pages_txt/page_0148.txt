SOME OTHER DOMAINS OF
NEUROPLASTICITY

e’ve seen how in adults experience can alter the number of
synapses and dendritic branches, remap circuitry, and stimulate
neurogenesis.26 Collectively, these effects can be big enough to actually
change the size of brain regions. For example, postmenopausal estrogen
treatment increases the size of the hippocampus (probably through a
combination of more dendritic branches and more neurons). Conversely,
the hippocampus atrophies (producing cognitive problems) in prolonged
depression, probably reflecting its stressfulness and the typically
elevated glucocorticoid levels of the disease. Memory problems and loss
of hippocampal volume also occur in individuals with severe chronic
pain syndromes, or with Cushing’s syndrome (an array of disorders
where a tumor causes extremely elevated glucocorticoid levels).
Moreover, post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with increased
volume (and, as we know, hyperreactivity) of the amygdala. In all of
these instances it is unclear how much the stress/glucocorticoid effects
are due to changes in neuron number or to changes in amounts of
dendritic processes.*
One cool example of the size of a brain region changing with
experience concerns the back part of the hippocampus, which plays a
role in memory of spatial maps. Cab drivers use spatial maps for a living,
and one renowned study showed enlargement of that part of the
hippocampus in London taxi drivers. Moreover, a follow-up study
imaged the hippocampus in people before and after the grueling
multiyear process of working and studying for the London cabbie license
test (called the toughest test in the world by the New York Times). The
hippocampus enlarged over the course of the process—in those who
passed the test.27
Thus, experience, health, and hormone fluctuations can change the
size of parts of the brain in a matter of months. Experience can also
cause long-lasting changes in the numbers of receptors for
neurotransmitters and hormones, in levels of ion channels, and in the
