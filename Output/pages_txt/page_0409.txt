UNIQUE REALMS OF HUMAN US/THEM-
ING
D
espite other primates displaying rudimentary abstractions of
Us/Them-ing, humans are in a stratosphere of uniqueness. In this
section I consider how:
we all belong to multiple categories of Us, and their
relative importance can rapidly change;
all Thems are not the same, and we have complex
taxonomies about different types of Thems and the
responses they evoke;
we can feel badly about Us/Them-ing and try to conceal
it;
cultural mechanisms can sharpen or soften the edges of
our dichotomizing.
Multiple Us-es
I am a vertebrate, mammal, primate, ape, human, male, scientist,
lefty, sun sneezer, Breaking Bad obsessive, and Green Bay Packers fan.*
All grounds for concocting an Us/Them. Crucially, which Us is most
important to me constantly shifts—if some octopus moved in next door, I
would feel hostile superiority because I have a spine and it didn’t, but
that animosity might melt into a sense of kinship when I discovered that
the octopus, like me, loved playing Twister as a kid.

We all belong to multiple Us/Them dichotomies. Sometimes one can be
a surrogate for another—for example, the dichotomy of people who
are/aren’t knowledgeable about caviar is a good stand-in for a dichotomy
about socioeconomic status.
