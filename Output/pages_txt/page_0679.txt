of the title to chapter 6. Warm, heartfelt thanks to Katinka Matson and
Steven Barclay, my publishing and speaking agents, sounding boards,
and friends—you both know how long and difficult the gestation of this
book was, and thank you for sticking with me throughout. I thank Scott
Moyers of Penguin with huge gratitude—you have been a dream of an
editor. And I apologize to anyone whose support I have missed noting
here, as I rush frantically to meet the deadline for this book. . . .
Finally, above all else, I thank and madly love those who have given
the most support, and who have withstood the most interruptions of
board games, while I worked on the book—my family.
