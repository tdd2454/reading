SUMMARY AND SOME CONCLUSIONS
Hormones are great; they run circles around
neurotransmitters, in terms of the versatility and
duration of their effects. And this includes affecting the
behaviors pertinent to this book.
Testosterone has far less to do with aggression than most
assume. Within the normal range, individual differences
in testosterone levels don’t predict who will be
aggressive. Moreover, the more an organism has been
aggressive, the less testosterone is needed for future
aggression. When testosterone does play a role, it’s
facilitatory—testosterone does not “invent” aggression.
It makes us more sensitive to triggers of aggression,
particularly in those most prone to aggression. Also,
rising testosterone levels foster aggression only during
challenges to status. Finally, crucially, the rise in
testosterone during a status challenge does not
necessarily increase aggression; it increases whatever is
needed to maintain status. In a world in which status is
awarded for the best of our behaviors, testosterone
would be the most prosocial hormone in existence.
Oxytocin and vasopressin facilitate mother-infant bond
formation and monogamous pair-bonding, decrease
anxiety and stress, enhance trust and social affiliation,
and make people more cooperative and generous. But
this comes with a huge caveat—these hormones increase
prosociality only toward an Us. When dealing with
Thems, they make us more ethnocentric and
xenophobic. Oxytocin is not a universal luv hormone.
It’s a parochial one.
Female aggression in defense of offspring is typically
adaptive and is facilitated by estrogen, progesterone, and
oxytocin. Importantly, females are aggressive in many
other evolutionarily adaptive circumstances. Such
