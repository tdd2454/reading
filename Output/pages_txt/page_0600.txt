socioeconomic status of your family of birth; a concussive head injury;
sleep quality and quantity; prenatal environment; stress and
glucocorticoid levels; whether you’re in pain; if you have Parkinson’s
disease and which medication you’ve been prescribed; perinatal hypoxia;
your dopamine D4 receptor gene variant; if you have had a stroke in
your frontal cortex; if you suffered childhood abuse; how much of a
cognitive load you’ve borne in the last few minutes; your MAO-A gene
variant; if you’re infected with a particular parasite; if you have the gene
for Huntington’s disease; lead levels in your tap water when you were a
kid; if you live in an individualist or a collectivist culture; if you’re a
heterosexual male and there’s an attractive woman around; if you’ve
been smelling the sweat of someone who is frightened. On and on. Of all
the stances of mitigated free will, the one that assigns aptitude to biology
and effort to free will, or impulse to biology and resisting it to free will,
is the most permeating and destructive. “You must have worked so hard”
is as much a property of the physical universe and the biology that
emerged from it as is “You must be so smart.” And yes, being a child
molester is as much a product of biology as is being a pedophile. To
think otherwise is little more than folk psychology.
