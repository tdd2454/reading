he two previous chapters examined the thoroughly unique
contexts for some human behaviors that are on a continuum with
behaviors in other species. Like some other species, we make automatic
Us/Them dichotomies and favor the former—though only humans
rationalize that tendency with ideology. Like many other species, we are
implicitly hierarchical—though only humans view the gap between
haves and have-nots as a divine plan.
This chapter considers another domain rife with human uniqueness,
namely morality. For us, morality is not only belief in norms of
appropriate behavior but also the belief that they should be shared and
transmitted culturally.
Work in the field is dominated by a familiar sort of question. When
we make a decision regarding morality, is it mostly the outcome of moral
reasoning or of moral intuition? Do we mostly think or feel our way to
deciding what is right?
This raises a related question. Is human morality as new as the
cultural institutions we’ve hatched in recent millennia, or are its
rudiments a far older primate legacy?
This raises more questions. What’s more impressive, consistencies
and universalities of human moral behavior or variability and its
correlation with cultural and ecological factors?
Finally, there will be unapologetically prescriptive questions. When it
comes to moral decision making, when is it “better” to rely on intuition,
