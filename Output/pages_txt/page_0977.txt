* The brutality of these studies helped spawn the animal-rights movement. I’ve been deeply conflicted about Harlow’s work
since I was first moved to tears reading about it as a teenager. He was appallingly callous, readily admitted that he felt
nothing for the monkeys, and did too many of the deprivation studies. But at the same time, the work helped, among other
things, lay the groundwork for understanding the biology of how early-life loss predisposes toward adult depression. Given
the prevailing wisdom at the time concerning child rearing and the perceived irrelevance of features of parenting that we now
view as vital, the irony is that it was Harlow’s pioneering work that most clearly demonstrated the immorality of doing such
research.
