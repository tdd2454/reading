* Consider individuals with “repressive” personalities. Such individuals have highly regimented affect and behavior—they’re
not emotionally expressive and aren’t great at reading emotions in others. They like ordered, structured, predictable lives, can
tell you what they’re having for dinner a week from Thursday, and complete everything on time. And they have elevated
metabolism in the frontal cortex and elevated circulating levels of stress hormones, showing that it can be enormously
stressful to construct a world in which nothing stressful ever occurs.
