when asked to do so, both are equally adept at dispassionately presenting
the viewpoints of the opposite camp. It’s that liberals are more motivated
to push toward situational explanations.
Why? Some have suggested it’s a greater respect for thinking, which
readily becomes an unhelpful tautology. Linda Skitka of the University
of Illinois emphasizes how the personal attributions of snap judgments
readily feel dissonant to liberals, at odds with their principles; thus they
are motivated to think their way to a more consonant view. In contrast,
even with more time, conservatives don’t become more situational,
because there’s no dissonance.
Proportion of rulings in favor of the prisoner s by ordinal position. Circled points indicate
the first decision in each of the three decision sessions; tick marks on x axis denote every
third case; dotted line denotes food break. Because unequal session lengths resulted in a low
number of cases for some of the later ordinal positions, the graph is based on the first 95%
of the data from each session.
While logical, this just turfs us to asking where the liberal ideology
causing the dissonance comes from in the first place. As we’ll see, it
comes from factors having little to do with cognitive style.
These findings suggest that it’s easier to make a liberal think like a
conservative than the other way around.35 Or, stated in a familiar way,
increasing cognitive load* should make people more conservative. This
is precisely the case. The time pressure of snap judgments is a version of
