THREE METAPHORICAL (BUT NOT
LITERAL) LAYERS
W
e start by considering the brain’s macroorganization, using a
model proposed in the 1960s by the neuroscientist Paul
MacLean.1 His “triune brain” model conceptualizes the brain as having
three functional domains:
Layer 1: An ancient part of the brain, at its base, found in species from
humans to geckos. This layer mediates automatic, regulatory functions.
If body temperature drops, this brain region senses it and commands
muscles to shiver. If blood glucose levels plummet, that’s sensed here,
generating hunger. If an injury occurs, a different loop initiates a stress
response.
Layer 2: A more recently evolved region that has expanded in
mammals. MacLean conceptualized this layer as being about emotions,
somewhat of a mammalian invention. If you see something gruesome
and terrifying, this layer sends commands down to ancient layer 1,
making you shiver with emotion. If you’re feeling sadly unloved, regions
here prompt layer 1 to generate a craving for comfort food. If you’re a
rodent and smell a cat, neurons here cause layer 1 to initiate a stress
response.
Layer 3: The recently evolved layer of neocortex sitting on the upper
surface of the brain. Proportionately, primates devote more of their brain
to this layer than do other species. Cognition, memory storage, sensory
processing, abstractions, philosophy, navel contemplation. Read a scary
passage of a book, and layer 3 signals layer 2 to make you feel
frightened, prompting layer 1 to initiate shivering. See an ad for Oreos
and feel a craving—layer 3 influences layers 2 and 1. Contemplate the
fact that loved ones won’t live forever, or kids in refugee camps, or how
the Na’vis’ home tree was destroyed by those jerk humans in Avatar
(despite the fact that, wait, Na’vi aren’t real!), and layer 3 pulls layers 2
and 1 into the picture, and you feel sad and have the same sort of stress
response that you’d have if you were fleeing a lion.
