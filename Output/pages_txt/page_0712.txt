Appendix 3
Protein Basics
P
roteins are a class of organic compounds that are the most
abundant molecules in living systems. They are hugely important,
since numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, and messengers of the
immune system are made of protein; ditto for the receptors that respond
to those messengers, the enzymes that construct or degrade them,* the
scaffolding that shapes a cell, and so on.
A key feature of proteins is their shape, since the shape of a protein
determines its function. Proteins that form the scaffolding of a cell have
the shape of the different crossbars in scaffolding at construction sites
(sort of). A protein hormone will have a distinctive shape that is unique
and distinctively different from the shape of a hormone that has different
effects.* And a protein receptor must have a shape that is complementary
to the shape of the hormone or neurotransmitter that it binds (back to the
time-honored cliché of appendix 1, namely that a messenger like a
hormone fits into its receptor like a key into a lock).
Some proteins change their shape, typically moving between two
conformations. Suppose you have an enzyme (again, a protein) that
synthesizes a molecule of sucrose by linking a molecule of glucose to a
molecule of fructose. The enzyme must have one conformation that
resembles the letter V, where one end binds a glucose molecule at a
particular angle, the other fructose. The binding of both triggers the
enzyme to shift to its other conformation, where the two ends of the V
move close enough for the glucose and fructose to be linked. The sucrose
floats off, and the enzyme flips back to its original conformation.
