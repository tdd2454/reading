One
The Behavior
W
e have our strategy in place. A behavior has occurred—one
that is reprehensible, or wonderful, or floating ambiguously in
between. What occurred in the prior second that triggered the behavior?
This is the province of the nervous system. What occurred in the prior
seconds to minutes that triggered the nervous system to produce that
behavior? This is the world of sensory stimuli, much of it sensed
unconsciously. What occurred in the prior hours to days to change the
sensitivity of the nervous system to such stimuli? Acute actions of
hormones. And so on, all the way back to the evolutionary pressures
played out over the prior millions of years that started the ball rolling.
So we’re set. Except that when approaching this big sprawling mess
of a subject, it is kind of incumbent upon you to first define your terms.
Which is an unwelcome prospect.
Here are some words of central importance to this book: aggression,
violence, compassion, empathy, sympathy, competition, cooperation,
altruism, envy, schadenfreude, spite, forgiveness, reconciliation, revenge,
reciprocity, and (why not?) love. Flinging us into definitional quagmires.
Why the difficulty? As emphasized in the introduction, one reason is
that so many of these terms are the subject of ideological battles over the
appropriation and distortions of their meanings.*1 Words pack power and
these definitions are laden with values, often wildly idiosyncratic ones.
Here’s an example, namely the ways I think about the word
“competition”: (a) “competition”—your lab team races the Cambridge
group to a discovery (exhilarating but embarrassing to admit to); (b)
“competition”—playing pickup soccer (fine, as long as the best player
shifts sides if the score becomes lopsided); (c) “competition”—your
child’s teacher announces a prize for the best outlining-your-fingers
