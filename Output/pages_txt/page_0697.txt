Such temporal sharpening of a signal can be accomplished in another
way:
Neuron A stimulates B and C. Neuron C sends an inhibitory signal
on to neuron B that will arrive sometime after B starts getting stimulated
(since the A/C/B loop is two synaptic steps, versus one for A/B). Result?
Sharpening a signal with “feed-forward inhibition.”
Now for another type of sharpening of a signal, of increasing the
signal to noise ratio. Consider this six-neuron circuit, where neuron A
stimulates B, C stimulates D, and E stimulates F:
