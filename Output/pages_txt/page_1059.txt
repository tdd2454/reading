* That is, the heterozygotic state. I made the tough decision to bypass homozygosity and heterozygosity in the main text, in
the interest of simplicity for the newcomer, and to instead exile the subject to footnotes. A brief primer: A point that I blithely
ignored in the genetics chapter is that most species, including humans, are “diploid,” which means that there are actually two
sets of chromosomes in each cell, with the same variety of genes. Eggs and sperm are specialized cells, being haploid (i.e.,
containing only a single copy of a chromosome). Put them together, and the egg that is destined to make you you is now
fertilized (i.e., diploid). Thus you actually have two copies of each gene, one from each parent. (Footnote to a footnote: the
exception is a specialized collection of genes in mitochondria, which come almost entirely from the mother). If both copies of
the gene have sequences that code for identical copies of a protein, the gene is “homozygotic.” If there are two different
versions, the gene is “heterozygotic.” What sort of trait is specified by the heterozygotic mixing of a gene? Some of the time,
the result is a trait that is intermediate between the two possible forms of homozygosity. More often the heterozygotic form
produces a trait that is identical to one of the two homozygotic forms. In other words, one of the versions “wins” out over the
other and is called a “dominant” version of the gene. In contrast, versions of genes that produce a trait only when in the
homozygotic form are “recessive.” If this is vastly confusing, I promise that you’ll be okay reading the rest of the book,
nonetheless.
