prefer to be feared than loved, and that we aim to live well as the best
revenge.
Finally, there is the challenge of a compassionate act being left by the
wayside when the empathic state is sufficiently real and vivid and awful.
I’m not advocating that people become Buddhists in order to make the
world a better place. (Nor am I advocating that people don’t become
Buddhists; what is the sound of one atheist waffling?) Most of us
typically require moments of piercing, frothing shared pain to even
notice those around us in need. Our intuitions run counter to doing it any
other way—after all, just as one of the most frightening versions of
humans at their worst is “cold-blooded” killing, one of the most puzzling
and even off-putting of us at our best is “cold-blooded” kindness. Yet, as
we’ve seen, a fair degree of detachment is just what is needed to actually
act. Better that than our hearts racing in pained synchrony with the heart
of someone suffering, if that cardiovascular activation mostly primes us
to flee when it all becomes just too much to bear.
Which brings us to a final point. Yes, you don’t act because someone
else’s pain is so painful—that’s a scenario that begs you to flee instead.
But the detachment that should be aimed for doesn’t represent choosing
a “cognitive” approach to doing good over an “affective” one. The
detachment isn’t slowly, laboriously thinking your way to acting
compassionately as an ideal utilitarian solution—the danger here is the
ease with which you can instead think your way to conveniently
concluding this isn’t your problem to worry about. The key is neither a
good (limbic) heart nor a frontal cortex that can reason you to the point
of action. Instead it’s the case of things that have long since become
implicit and automatic—being potty trained; riding a bike; telling the
truth; helping someone in need.
