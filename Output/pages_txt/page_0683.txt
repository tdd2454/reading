moment). Those axon terminals connect to the dendrites of the next
neuron in line. Thus a neuron’s dendritic ears are informed that the
neuron behind it is excited. The flow of information then sweeps from
the dendrites to the cell body to the axon to the axon terminals, and is
then passed to the next neuron.
Let’s translate “flow of information” into quasi chemistry. What
actually goes from the dendrites to the axon terminals? A wave of
electrical excitation. Inside the neuron are various positively and
negatively charged ions. Just outside the neuron’s membrane are other
positively and negatively charged ions. When a neuron has gotten an
exciting signal from the previous neuron at the end of one single
dendritic fiber, channels in the membrane in that dendrite open, allowing
various ions to flow in and others to flow out, and the net result is that
the inside of the end of that dendrite becomes more positively charged.
The charge spreads toward the axon terminal, where it is passed to the
next neuron. That’s it for the chemistry.
Two gigantically important details:
The resting potential. So when a neuron has gotten a hugely excitatory
message from the previous neuron in line, its insides can become
positively charged relative to the extracellular space around it. Back to
