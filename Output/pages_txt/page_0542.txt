THE CORE ISSUE: ACTUALLY DOING
SOMETHING
T
he previous chapter considered the world of difference between
highfalutin moral reasoning and whether, at a crucial juncture,
someone actually does the right thing. As we saw, there is something
consistent about that latter type of person: “What were you thinking
when you leaped into that river to save the child?” “I wasn’t; before I
knew it, I’d jumped in.” An act of implicit automaticity, the product of a
childhood in which doing the right thing was ingrained as an automatic,
moral imperative, light-years away from the frontal cortex calculating
costs and benefits.
We face a similar situation here, one that is the core of this chapter.
Sympathy versus empathy, “for” versus “as if,” affect versus cognition,
what we do versus what other species do—does any of this actually
predict who does something compassionate to lessen someone’s pains?
Similarly, does any of this predict whether the person acting
compassionately acts effectively, and how much it’s an act of self-
interest? As we’ll see, there is a yawning gap between being in an
empathic state and acting effectively in a way that is truly selfless.

It is far from guaranteed that an empathic state leads to a
compassionate act. One reason for this is captured superbly by the
essayist Leslie Jamison:

tempting to think that feeling someone’s pain is necessarily
virtuous in its own right. The peril of empathy isn’t simply that it
can make us feel bad, but that it can make us feel good, which can
