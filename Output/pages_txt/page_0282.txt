Quechua of the northern parts of South America, at around 55 percent.
Finally there are the descendants of folks who made it all the way to the
Amazon basin—the Ticuna, Surui, and Karitiana—with a roughly 70
percent incidence of 7R, the highest in the world. In other words, the
descendants of people who, having made it to the future downtown
Anchorage, decided to just keep going for another six thousand miles.*
A high incidence of 7R, associated with impulsivity and novelty seeking,
is the legacy of humans who made the greatest migrations in human
history.
And then in the middle of the chart is the near-zero incidence of 7R
in China, Cambodia, Japan, and Taiwan (among the Ami and Atayal).
When East Asians domesticated rice and invented collectivist society,
there was massive selection against the 7R variant; in Kidd’s words, it
was “nearly lost” in these populations.* Maybe the bearers of 7R broke
their necks inventing hang gliding or got antsy and tried to walk to
Alaska but drowned because there was no longer a Bering land bridge.
Maybe they were less desirable mates. Regardless of the cause, East
Asian cultural collectivism coevolved with selection against the 7R
variant.*
Thus, in this most studied of cultural contrasts, we see clustering of
ecological factors, modes of production, cultural differences, and
differences in endocrinology, neurobiology, and gene frequencies.* The
cultural contrasts appear in likely ways—e.g., morality, empathy, child-
rearing practices, competition, cooperation, definitions of happiness—
but also in unexpected ones—e.g., where, within milliseconds, your eyes
look at a picture, or you’re thinking about bunnies and carrots.
