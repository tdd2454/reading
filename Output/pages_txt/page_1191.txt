* The coming of peace to Northern Ireland was laden with other instances of sacred values and symbolism. For example,
around the time that the Reverend Ian Paisley, as bloody-handed a Unionist as there was, became first minister in Northern
Ireland, the Catholic president of the Republic of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, sent Paisley and his wife a fiftieth wedding-
anniversary gift—a wooden bowl. This was rife with meaning, as it was crafted from a tree at the Irish site of the Battle of the
Boyne, where in 1690 the Protestant William of Orange defeated Catholic James II. That victory was critical to the
subsequent centuries of Protestant domination in Ireland, an endless point of pain for Catholics and pride for Protestants (who
would commemorate the victory every July 12 with provocative marches through Catholic neighborhoods that usually ended
in violence). For Ahern to acknowledge the sacred historical significance of the site for Unionists was enormous. Paisley
soon reciprocated by visiting the site with Ahern, bringing him a 1685 musket as a gift and talking about the significance of
the site for all the Irish people.
