THE REALITY OF ADOLESCENCE
I
s adolescence real? Is there something qualitatively different
distinguishing it from before and after, rather than being part of a
smooth progression from childhood to adulthood? Maybe “adolescence”
is just a cultural construct—in the West, as better nutrition and health
resulted in earlier puberty onset, and the educational and economic
forces of modernity pushed for childbearing at later ages, a
developmental gap emerged between the two. Voilà! The invention of
adolescence.*2
As we’ll see, neurobiology suggests that adolescence is for real, that
the adolescent brain is not merely a half-cooked adult brain or a child’s
brain left unrefrigerated for too long. Moreover, most traditional cultures
do recognize adolescence as distinct, i.e., it brings some but not all of the
rights and responsibilities of adulthood. Nonetheless, what the West
invented is the longest period of adolescence.*
What does seem a construct of individualistic cultures is adolescence
as a period of intergenerational conflict; youth of collectivist cultures
seem less prone toward eye rolling at the dorkiness of adults, starting
with parents. Moreover, even within individualistic cultures adolescence
is not universally a time of acne of the psyche, of Sturm und Drang.
Most of us get through it just fine.
