* Pinker’s response to the cherry-picking charge is as follows: “Better Angels reports all the published estimates of per capita
rates of violent death in the archaeological and anthropological literature I could find.” S. Pinker, “Violence: Clarified,” Sci
338 (2012): 327. If I understand what he is saying accurately, this feels a bit facile. To be facetious, this would be like not
including Quakers in one’s analysis of violence because no one studying them had published something along the lines of
“Estimated per-capita rates of death in Quaker communities due to gangland-style executions in nightclubs: zero; due to
targeted drone missile strikes: zero; due to dirty bombs made with stolen plutonium: zero . . .”
