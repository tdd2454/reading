of islands and peninsulas maximizes the number of people living within
a surrounded enclave.*
The authors then considered a balkanized region, namely the
Balkans, ex-Yugoslavia, in 1990. This was just before Serbians,
Bosnians, Croatians, and Albanians commenced Europe’s worst war
since World War II, the war that taught us the names of places like
Srebrenica and people like Slobodan Milošević. Using a similar analysis,
with ethnic island size varying from roughly twenty to sixty kilometers
in diameter, they identified the spots theoretically most rife for violence;
remarkably, this predicted the sites of major fighting and massacres in
the war.
In the words of the authors, violence can arise “due to the structure of
boundaries between groups rather than as a result of inherent conflicts
between the groups themselves.” They then showed that the clarity of
borders matters as well. Good, clear-cut fences—e.g., mountain ranges
or rivers between groups—make for good neighbors. “Peace does not
depend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well defined
topographical and political boundaries separating groups, allowing for
partial autonomy within a single country,” the authors concluded.
Thus, not only do size, density, and heterogeneity of populations help
explain intergroup violence, but patterns and clarity of fragmentation do
as well. These issues will be revisited in the final chapter.
