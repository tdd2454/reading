* Strongly suggesting that these neurons independently evolved on three separate occasions, given the evolutionary distances
between primates, cetaceans, and elephants. The nearest relatives of elephants, for example, are hyraxes and manatees. The
convergent evolution of von Economo neurons from three separate lineages emphasizes that these cells go hand in hand with
major sociality.
