* Boehm emphasizes that anthropologists never really know what truly is going on among their research subjects until
they’re privy to gossip. In doing my baboon research, I spent many seasons sharing camp with Maasai guys whom I knew
relatively well and would hear about big goings-on in their community. Eventually, my soon-to-be wife started joining me in
the field, and it was only then that we started to hear about the good stuff, via her becoming friends with some of the women
—the usual of who was or wasn’t sleeping with whom.
