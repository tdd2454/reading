* Another striking difference in gene variant frequencies concerns the gene coding for the serotonin transporter, which
removes serotonin from the synapse and which, as we saw in the last chapter, is associated with impulsive aggression in
vastly confusing ways. One variant of the gene is associated with negative emotion, an attentional bias toward negative
stimuli, anxiety, and depression risk when coupled with stressful risk factors. Its incidence is less than 50 percent worldwide
but 70 to 80 percent in East Asian populations.
