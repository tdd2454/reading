* Ironic footnote: Cajal was the chief exponent of the neuron doctrine. And the leading voice in favor of synctitiums? Golgi;
the technique he invented showed that he was wrong. He apparently moped the entire way to Stockholm to receive his Nobel
Prize in 1906—shared with Cajal. The two loathed each other, didn’t even speak. In his Nobel address, Cajal managed to
muster the good manners to praise Golgi. Golgi, in his, attacked Cajal and the neuron doctrine. Jerk.
