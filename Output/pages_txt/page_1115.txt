* The story has a double layer of poignancies. Prior to the war, one of Armistead’s closest friends was Winfield Scott
Hancock, commanding a brigade at the battle . . . on the Union side. The dying Armistead asked after Hancock’s well-being
and requested that Bingham send his warm greetings to his old friend.
