MULTILEVEL SELECTION
S
o we’ve got individual selection, kin selection, and reciprocal
altruism. And then what happened in recent years? Group selection
reappeared, sneaking in the back door.
“Neo–group selection” crashed a long-standing debate as to the “unit
of selection.”
Genotype Versus Phenotype, and the Most
Meaningful Level of Selection
To appreciate this, let’s contrast genotype and phenotype. Genotype =
someone’s genetic makeup. Phenotype = the traits observable to the
outside world produced by that genotype.*
Suppose there’s a gene that influences whether your eyebrows come
in two separate halves or form a continuous unibrow. You’ve noted that
unibrow prevalence is decreasing in a population. Which is the more
important level for understanding why—the gene variant or the eyebrow
phenotype? We know after chapter 8 that genotype and phenotype are
not synonymous, because of gene/environment interactions. Maybe some
prenatal environmental effect silences one version of the gene but not the
other. Maybe a subset of the population belongs to a religion where you
must cover your eyebrows when around the opposite sex, and thus
eyebrow phenotype is untouched by sexual selection.
You’re a grad student researching unibrow decline, and you must
choose whether to study things at the genotypic or phenotypic level.
Genotypic: sequencing eyebrow gene variants, trying to understand their
regulation. Phenotypic: examining, say, eyebrow appearance and mate
choice, or whether unibrows absorb more heat from sunlight, thereby
damaging the frontal cortex, producing inappropriate social behavior and
decreased reproductive success.
This was the debate—is evolution best understood by focusing on
genotype or phenotype?
