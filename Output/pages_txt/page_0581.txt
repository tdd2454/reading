choir singing the Afrikaans anthem, “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,” a
craggy song with references to the country’s craggy mountains.* This
came before the South African host team’s mythic underdog winning of
the World Cup in 1995 in Johannesburg.
I could watch that YouTube clip of the anthems being sung at the
World Cup all day long, especially after having to write the section on
Rwanda. What do Hussein, McGuinness, Robinson, Viljoen, and
Mandela show? That our confusion of the literal and the metaphorical,
our granting of life-threatening sanctity to the symbolic, can be used to
bring about the best of our behaviors. Which prepares us for the final
chapter, soon to come.
