* A powerful example of this is seen in the first war of Indian independence, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, of 1857.
Indian soldiers—sepoys—serving in the British East India Company’s army rebelled when it became known that the bullets
they were issued were greased in either tallow, derived from cows, or lard, from pigs—major offenses to the Hindu and
Muslim soldiers, respectively. Mind you, this was not the British colonial overlords doing something offensive to the core
cultural values of either group—for example, declaring Allah a false prophet or banning polytheistic worship. Virtually every
culture on earth has food prohibitions, often pretty arbitrary ones meant to merely signal core values (kosher laws for
Orthodox Jews, for example, revolve around zoological arcana about whether a species has a cloven hoof) but that eventually
gain a huge power. Before it was over, the Sepoy Mutiny killed more than 100,000 Indians.
