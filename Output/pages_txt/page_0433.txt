RANK AND HIERARCHY IN HUMANS
H
uman hierarchies resemble those of other species in many ways.
For example, there’s the distinction between stable and unstable
hierarchies—centuries of czarist rule versus the first inning of the
Russian Revolution. As we’ll see below, those situations evoke different
patterns of brain activation.
Group size also matters—primate species with bigger social groups
have larger cortices relative to the rest of the brain (with humans topping
off both measures).5 If you graph the size of the neocortex against the
average size of the social group across primate species, you get
“Dunbar’s number,” the predicted average group size in traditional
human cultures. It’s 150 people, and there’s much evidence supporting
that prediction.
This also plays out in the Western world, where the larger the size of
someone’s social network (often calculated by the number of e-
mail/texting relationships), the larger the vmPFC, orbital PFC, and
amygdala, and the better the person’s Theory of Mind–related skills.6
Do these brain regions expand when someone has a larger social
network, or do larger sizes of these regions predispose people toward
forming larger networks? Naturally, some of both.
As with other species, human quality of life also varies with the
consequences of rank inequalities—there’s a big difference between the
powerful getting seated at a restaurant before you and the powerful
getting to behead you if the fancy strikes them. Recall the study of thirty-
seven countries showing that the more income inequality, the more
preadolescent bullying in schools. In other words, countries with more
brutal socioeconomic hierarchies produce children who enforce their
own hierarchies more brutally.7
Amid these cross-species similarities, there are unique things about
humans, including the following.
