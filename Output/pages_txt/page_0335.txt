BEHAVIOR CAN BE SHAPED BY
EVOLUTION
O
rganisms are amazingly well adapted. A desert rodent has kidneys
that excel at retaining water; a giraffe’s huge heart can pump blood
up to its brain; elephants’ leg bones are strong enough to support an
elephant. Well, yes—it has to work that way: desert rodents whose
kidneys weren’t great at retaining water didn’t pass on copies of their
genes. Thus there is a logic to evolution, where natural selection sculpts
traits into adaptiveness.
Importantly, natural selection works not only on anatomy and
physiology but on behavior as well—in other words, behavior evolves,
can be optimized by selection into being adaptive.
Various branches of biology focus on the evolution of behavior.
Probably best known is sociobiology, premised on social behavior being
sculpted by evolution to be optimized, just as biomechanical
optimization sculpts the size of a giraffe’s heart.4 Sociobiology emerged
in the 1970s, eventually generating the offshoot evolutionary psychology
—the study of the evolutionary optimization of psychological traits; as
we’ll see, both have been plenty controversial. As a simplifying
convenience, I’ll refer to people who study the evolution of social
behavior as “sociobiologists.”
