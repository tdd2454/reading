The most visible proponent of
the gene-centered view has long
been Dawkins, with his iconic
“selfish gene” meme—it is the gene
that is passed to the next
generation, the thing whose variants
spread or decline over time.
Moreover, a gene is a clear and
distinctive sequence of letters,
reductive and irrefutable, while
phenotypic traits are much fuzzier
and less distinct.
This is the core of the concept
of “a chicken is just an egg’s way of making another egg”—the organism
is just a vehicle for the genome to be replicated in the next generation,
and behavior is just this wispy epiphenomenon that facilitates the
replication.
This gene-centered view can be divided in two. One is that the
genome (i.e., the collection of all the genes, regulatory elements, and so
on) is the best level to think about things. The more radical view, held by
Dawkins, is that the most appropriate level is that of individual genes—
i.e., selfish genes, rather than selfish genomes.
Amid some evidence for single-gene selection (an obscure
phenomenon called intragenomic conflict, which we won’t go into),
most people who vote for the importance of gene(s) over phenotype view
single-gene selfishness as a bit of a sideshow and vote for the genome
level of selection being most important.
Meanwhile, there’s the view that phenotype trumps genotype,
something championed by Ernst Mayr, Stephen Jay Gould, and others.
The core of their argument is that it’s phenotypes rather than genotypes
that are selected for. As Gould wrote, “No matter how much power
Dawkins wishes to assign to genes, there is one thing he cannot give
them—direct visibility to natural selection.” In that view, genes and the
frequencies of their variants are merely the record of what arose from
phenotypic selection.43
Dawkins introduced a great metaphor: a cake recipe is a genotype,
and how the cake tastes is the phenotype.* Genotype chauvinists
emphasize that the recipe is what is passed on, the sequence of words
