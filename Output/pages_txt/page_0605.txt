menstruating (which typically exacerbates symptoms in seriously
depressed women, making it more likely that they’ll be socially
withdrawn rather than reaching out to someone). Some more
predictability. Maybe even above the 50 percent mark by now. Add
enough factors, many of which, possibly most of which, have not yet
been discovered, and eventually your multifactorial biological
knowledge will give you the same predictive power as in the fractured-
bone scenario. Not different amounts of biological causation; different
types of causation.
The artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky once defined free
will as “internal forces I do not understand.”26 People intuitively believe
in free will, not just because we have this terrible human need for agency
but also because most people know next to nothing about those internal
forces. And even the neuroscientist on the witness stand can’t accurately
predict which individual with extensive frontal damage will become the
serial murderer, because science as a whole still knows about only a
handful of those internal forces. Shattered bone → inflammation →
constricted movement is easy. Neurotransmitters + hormones +
childhood + ____ + ____ + isn’t.*27
Another factor comes into play. When I go to the Web of Science, a
search engine for scanning databases of papers published in science and
medical journals. Under search terms I put in “oxytocin” and “trust”—
just to pick an example of the umpteen links between biology and social
behavior that we’ve covered. And up comes the news that 193 papers
have been published on the subject. Consider the following figure,
showing that most of those papers have been published in the last few
years.
Same with the next figure, a search for “oxytocin” and “social
behavior” or, after that, “transcranial magnetic stimulation” and
“decision-making,” and then “brain” and “aggression.”
