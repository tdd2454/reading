THE ENDOCRINOLOGY OF
AGGRESSION IN FEMALES
H
elp!
This topic confuses me. Here’s why:
This is a domain where the ratios of two hormones can
matter more than their absolute levels, where the brain
responds the same way to (a) two units of estrogen plus
one unit of progesterone and (b) two gazillion units of
estrogen plus one gazillion units of progesterone. This
requires some complex neurobiology.
Hormone levels are extremely dynamic, with
hundredfold changes in some within hours—no male’s
testes ever had to navigate the endocrinology of
ovulation or childbirth. Among other things, re-creating
such endocrine fluctuations in lab animals is tough.
There’s dizzying variability across species. Some breed
year-round, others only in particular seasons; nursing
inhibits ovulation in some, stimulates it in others.
Progesterone rarely works in the brain as itself. Instead
it’s usually converted into various “neurosteroids” with
differing actions in different brain regions. And
“estrogen” describes a soup of related hormones, none
of which work identically.
Finally, one must debunk the myth that females are
always nice and affiliative (unless, of course, they’re
aggressively protecting their babies, which is cool and
inspirational).
