* How is such priming done? The subject is given a series of scrambled sentences and has to scramble them. In one group
most of the sentences discuss things that tap into the concept of loyalty (“teammates helps Jane her”), while the other group’s
sentences are about equality (“fairness advocates Chris for”).
