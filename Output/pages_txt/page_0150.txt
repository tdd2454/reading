SOME CONCLUSIONS
T
he discovery of adult neurogenesis is revolutionary, and the general
topic of neuroplasticity, in all its guises, is immensely important—
as is often the case when something the experts said couldn’t be turns out
to be.29 The subject is also fascinating because of the nature of the
revisionism—neuroplasticity radiates optimism. Books on the topic are
entitled The Brain That Changes Itself, Train Your Mind, Change Your
Brain, and Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life, hinting at
the “new neurology” (i.e., no more need for neurology once we can fully
harness neuroplasticity). There’s can-do Horatio Alger spirit every which
way you look.
Amid that, some cautionary points:
One recalls caveats aired in other chapters—the ability
of the brain to change in response to experience is value
free. Axonal remapping in blind or deaf individuals is
great, exciting, and moving. It’s cool that your
hippocampus expands if you drive a London cab. Ditto
about the size and specialization of the auditory cortex
in the triangle player in the orchestra. But at the other
end, it’s disastrous that trauma enlarges the amygdala
and atrophies the hippocampus, crippling those with
PTSD. Similarly, expanding the amount of motor cortex
devoted to finger dexterity is great in neurosurgeons but
probably not a societal plus in safe crackers.
The extent of neuroplasticity is most definitely finite.
Otherwise, grievously injured brains and severed spinal
cords would ultimately heal. Moreover, the limits of
neuroplasticity are quotidian. Malcolm Gladwell has
explored how vastly skilled individuals have put in vast
amounts of practice—ten thousand hours is his magic
number. Nevertheless, the reverse doesn’t hold: ten
thousand hours of practice does not guarantee the
