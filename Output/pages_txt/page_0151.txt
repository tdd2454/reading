neuroplasticity needed to make any of us a Yo-Yo Ma or
LeBron James.
Manipulating neuroplasticity for recovery of function does have
enormous, exciting potential in neurology. But this domain is far from
the concerns of this book. Despite neuroplasticity’s potential, it’s
unlikely that we’ll ever be able to, say, spritz neuronal growth factors up
people’s noses to make them more open-minded or empathic, or to target
neuroplasticity with gene therapy to blunt some jerk’s tendency to
displace aggression.
So what’s the subject good for in the realm of this book? I think the
benefits are mostly psychological. This recalls a point from chapter 2, in
the discussion of the neuroimaging studies demonstrating loss of volume
in the hippocampus of people with PTSD (certainly an example of the
adverse effects of neuroplasticity). I sniped that it was ridiculous that
many legislators needed pictures of the brain to believe that there was
something desperately, organically wrong with veterans with PTSD.
Similarly, neuroplasticity makes the functional malleability of the
brain tangible, makes it “scientifically demonstrated” that brains change.
That people change. In the time span considered in this chapter, people
throughout the Arab world went from being voiceless to toppling tyrants;
Rosa Parks went from victim to catalyst, Sadat and Begin from enemies
to architects of peace, Mandela from prisoner to statesman. And you’d
better bet that changes along the lines of those presented in this chapter
occurred in the brains of anyone transformed by these transformations. A
different world makes for a different worldview, which means a different
brain. And the more tangible and real the neurobiology underlying such
change seems, the easier it is to imagine that it can happen again.
