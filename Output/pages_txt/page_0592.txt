and shouldn’t be expected to be capable of. To get a feel for that, let’s
look at some of these debates.
Age, Maturity of Groups, Maturity of Individuals
In 2005’s Roper v. Simmons decision, the Supreme Court ruled that
you can’t execute someone for a crime committed before the age of
eighteen. The appropriate reasoning was straight out of chapters 6 and 7:
the brain, especially the frontal cortex, is not yet at adult levels of
emotional regulation and impulse control. In other words, adolescents,
with their adolescent brains, aren’t as culpable as adults. The reasoning
was the same as why the pig was executed but not her piglets.
In the years since, there have been related rulings. In 2010’s Graham
v. Florida and 2012’s Miller v. Alabama, the Court emphasized that
juvenile offenders have the highest potential for reform (because of their
still-developing brains) and thus banned life sentences without parole for
them.
These decisions have prompted a number of debates:
Just because adolescents are, on the average, less
neurobiologically and behaviorally mature than adults
doesn’t rule out the possibility of some individual
adolescents being as mature, thus being appropriately
held to adult standards of culpability. Related to that is
the obvious absurdity of implying that something
neurobiologically magical happens on the morning of
someone’s eighteenth birthday, endowing them with
adult levels of self-control. The usual response to these
points is that, yes, these are true, but the law often relies
on group-level attributes with arbitrary age boundaries
(e.g., the age at which someone can vote, drink, or
drive). There is this willingness because you can’t test
every teenager each year, month, hour, to determine
whether they are mature enough yet to, say, vote. But
it’s worth doing so when it comes to a teenage murderer.
In another contrarian view the issue isn’t whether a
seventeen-year-old is as mature as an adult but whether
