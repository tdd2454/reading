THREE PERSPECTIVES
L
et’s get down to cases. There are three ways of viewing the place of
biology in making sense of our behaviors, criminal or otherwise:
1. We have complete free will in our behavior.
2. We have none.
3. Somewhere in between.
If people are forced to carefully follow the logical extensions of their
views, probably less than a thousandth of a percent would support the
first proposition. Suppose someone convulsing with a grand mal
epileptic seizure, flinging their arms around, strikes someone. If you
truly believe we freely control our behavior, you must convict them of
assault.
Virtually everyone considers that absurd. Yet that legal outcome
would have occurred half a millennium ago in much of Europe.9 That
seems ludicrous because in the last few centuries the West has crossed a
line and left it so far behind that a world on the other side is
unimaginable. We embrace a concept that defines our progress—“It’s not
him. It’s his disease.” In other words, at times biology can overwhelm
anything resembling free will. This woman didn’t bump into you
maliciously; she’s blind. This soldier standing in formation didn’t pass
out because he doesn’t have what it takes; he’s diabetic and needs his
insulin. This woman isn’t heartless because she didn’t help the elderly
person who had fallen; she’s paralyzed from a spinal cord injury. Similar
shifts in the perception of criminal responsibility have occurred in other
realms. For example, from two to seven centuries ago, prosecution of
animals, objects, and corpses thought to have intentionally harmed
someone was commonplace. Some of these trials had a weirdly modern
tint to them—in a 1457 trial of a pig and her piglets for eating a child,
the pig was convicted and executed, whereas the piglets were found to be
too young to have been responsible for their acts. Whether the judge
cited the maturational state of their frontal cortices is unknown.
