* How would ethologists figure out what sensory information is pertinent to an animal? An example: Among gulls, the
mother’s beak has a conspicuous red spot. When she brings food to the chicks, they peck at the beak, and Mom regurgitates
the food. Here’s how Tinbergen proved that the red spot triggers the pecking behavior: A subtraction approach, where he’d
paint over the red spot on birds; chicks no longer pecked. A replication approach, where he’d take a two-by-four, paint a red
dot on it, and wave it over the nest; chicks would start pecking. Or super stimulation, where he’d paint a gigantic red dot on
the mother’s beak; chicks would go berserk with the pecking. This approach now incorporates robotics, where ethologists
have built, for example, robotic bees that infiltrate and fiendishly deceive bee colonies by dancing about nonexistent food
sources, which the bees then fly off in search of.
