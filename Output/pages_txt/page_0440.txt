A first wrinkle was provided by Jeanne Altmann of Princeton and
Susan Alberts of Duke, studying wild baboons with stable hierarchies.
They found the familiar picture, namely of subordination associated with
elevated basal glucocorticoid levels. However, unexpectedly, levels in
alphas were elevated into the range seen in lowest-ranking males. Why is
life more stressful for alpha than beta males? The two ranks had similar
rates of being challenged by lower-ranking males (a source of stress) and
being groomed by females (a source of coping). However, alpha males
fight more often and spend more time in sexual consortships with
females (which is majorly stressful, as the male has to defend his
consortship from harassing males). Ironically, a chief benefit of
alphadom—sexual consortships—can be a major stressor. Be careful
what you wish for.20

Okay, so except for the curse of being alpha, social subordination is
generally stressful. But this is also wrong. It’s not just the rank that
matters but what the rank means.
Consider the primate species in which a relationship has been found
between rank and glucocorticoid levels. Across these species, basal
