This chapter explores the neurobiology of some of the most
interesting outposts of symbolic and metaphorical thinking. It makes a
key point: these capacities evolved so recently that our brains are, if you
will, winging it and improvising on the fly when dealing with metaphor.
As a result, we are actually pretty lousy at distinguishing between the
metaphorical and literal, at remembering that “it’s only a figure of
speech”—with enormous consequences for our best and worst behaviors.
We start with examples of odd ways our brains handle metaphor, and
the behavioral manifestations of those oddities; some have been
introduced previously.
