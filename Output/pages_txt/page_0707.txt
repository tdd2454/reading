Suppose you have someone who has
sustained an injury in one particular
part of the brain, mysterious spot X.
This gives the opportunity to learn
something about the brain by now
seeing what no longer works right in
the person. Neuroscience as a field
really got its starts thanks to studies of soldiers who had
suffered “missile projection wounds.” Viewed in a
detached manner, the endless nineteenth-century
European military bloodbaths were God’s gift to
neuroanatomists. The injured individual now does
something abnormally. Can you conclude that spot X is
the part of the brain responsible for the normal version
of that behavior? Only if it’s where a cluster of neuronal
cell bodies are. If spot X is a fiber tract, you’re actually
learning something about the region of the brain whose
neurons sent axonal projections in that fiber tract, and
that region could be at the other end of the brain. So it’s
important to distinguish between “neuronal nuclei” and
“fibers of passage.”
Finally, back to the reference just now about a part of
the brain being the center for some behavior. The
examples from earlier in the chapter showed how hard it
is to make sense of the function of an individual neuron
without considering the network that it is part of. Same
theme here, writ large. Given that every brain region is
getting projections from and sending projections to a
zillion other places, it is rare that an individual brain
region is “the center for” anything. Instead it’s all
networks where, far more often, a particular region
“plays a key role in,” “helps mediate,” or “influences” a
behavior. The function of a particular brain region is
embedded in the context of its connections.
Thus, this concludes our Brain 101 primer.
