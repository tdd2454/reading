* It’s obvious which tribe I root for, being some manner of ethologist myself (but just to take this paean down a notch,
remember that one of ethology’s founders was the odious Konrad Lorenz). In an inspired move, the three founders of
ethology—Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Karl von Frisch—were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973.
The biomedical community was appalled. Giving the prize to guys with foot fungi, whose main research technique was
looking through binoculars—what’s that got to do with medicine? Of the trio, Lorenz was the energetic self-promoter and
flashy popularizer, Tinbergen, one of my heroes, was the deep thinker and amazing experimentalist, and von Frisch played
electric bass and didn’t say much.
