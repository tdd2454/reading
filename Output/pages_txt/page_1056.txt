* I was raised in an anthropology department that was a major stronghold of !Kung fandom and generalized this to a huge
fondness for all things African HG (probably in part because they’re all short). A tiny remnant HG tribe alternately called the
Ndorobo or Okiek lives in forests north of the Serengeti in Kenya. They have an oddly symbiotic relationship with the
neighboring Maasai, emerging from the forest to trade things or to serve a shamanistic role in some Maasai ceremony. They
are short and silent, dressed in animal skins, and I’ve taken great pleasure in seeing how they unnerve tall, spear-toting
Maasai. My Maasai friends would make fun of me for how obsessed I was with the Ndorobo.
