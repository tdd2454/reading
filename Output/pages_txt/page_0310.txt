prehistoric violence has the flavor of today’s archaeological graybeards
being nostalgic about getting stoned in high school and listening to John
Lennon’s “Imagine.”
Keeley and Pinker generated a strong backlash among many notable
archaeologists, who charged them with “war-ifying the past.” Most vocal
has been R. Brian Ferguson of Rutgers University, with publications with
titles like “Pinker’s List: Exaggerating Prehistoric War Mortality.”
Keeley and Pinker are criticized for numerous reasons:58
a. Some of the sites supposedly presenting evidence for
warfare actually contain only a single case of violent
death, suggesting homicide, not war.
b. The criteria for inferring violent death include skeletons
in close proximity to arrowheads. However, many such
artifacts were actually tools used for other purposes, or
simply chips and flakes. For example, Fred Wendorf,
who excavated Jebel Sahaba, considered most of the
projectiles associated with skeletons to have been mere
debris.59
c. Many fractured bones were actually healed. Instead of
reflecting war, they might indicate the ritualized club
fighting seen in many tribal societies.
d. Proving that a human bone was gnawed on by a fellow
human instead of another carnivore is tough. One tour-
de-force paper demonstrated cannibalism in a Pueblo
village from around the year 1100—human feces there
contained the human version of the muscle-specific
protein myoglobin.60 In other words, those humans had
been eating human meat. Nonetheless, even when
cannibalism is clearly documented, it doesn’t indicate
whether there was exo- or endocannibalism (i.e., eating
vanquished enemies versus deceased relatives, as is
done in some tribal cultures).
e. Most important, Keeley and Pinker are accused of
cherry-picking their data, discussing only sites of
putative war deaths, rather than the entire literature.*
