* Where do more copies of the receptors come from? Miles away from that dendritic spine, in the center of that neuron, is the
nucleus, containing the DNA, which includes genes coding for glutamate receptors. Somehow the nucleus needs to hear that
a calcium wave occurred in one dendritic spine in the boondocks. The nucleus then directs the synthesis of more copies of the
receptor, which are then shipped to that specific spine, out of the neuron’s ten thousand. That’s insanely hard. Typically,
instead, there are extra glutamate receptors mothballed inside dendritic spines, and the calcium tidal wave is the signal that
pulls them onto the spine’s membrane.
