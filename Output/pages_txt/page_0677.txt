Acknowledgments
The naturalist Edward O. Wilson, one of the most influential thinkers of
our time, has found himself at the center of fiery controversies related to
the evolution of human social behavior (discussed in chapter 10). An
elegant and graceful man, he has written about those disputes and those
who have most strongly opposed him—“Without a trace of irony I can
say I have been blessed with brilliant enemies. I owe them a great debt,
because they redoubled my energies and drove me in new directions.”
When it comes to this book, I count myself even luckier than Wilson,
in that I’ve had the good fortune of brilliant friends, ones who have been
enormously helpful and generous with their time in vetting the chapters
of this book. They’ve flagged my errors of omission and commission and
my under-, over-, and misinterpretations, and tactfully let me know areas
where I was twenty years out of date in my knowledge, or just plain
woefully wrong. This book has benefited enormously from their collegial
kindness, and I thank them all deeply (while taking credit for any errors
remaining). They are:
