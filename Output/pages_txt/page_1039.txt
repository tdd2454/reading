* As noted earlier, within a few generations of immigration, East Asian Americans are typically as individualist as European
Americans. This raises the question of whether East Asians who chose to immigrate had a higher frequency of 7R than East
Asians in general (one might also wonder whether there is a higher incidence of 7R in the wheat-growing regions of China
than in the rice districts). Unfortunately, according to Kenneth Kidd, no one knows about either.
