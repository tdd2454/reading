There’s no way I could ever be Thompson, Andreotta, or Colburn.
I’m not brave; I run away to solitary African field sites instead of
confronting difficult things. Maybe, at best, I would have been one of the
soldiers standing in confusion, compelled by the inhibitions that
Grossman discusses into repeatedly checking my rifle to make sure it
was loaded, rather than firing it. I see little indication that as an old man I
will achieve the grace and moral stature of a Zenji Abe or a Richard
Fiske. Bouazizi’s act is incomprehensible to me.
But Newton, Newton is different; Newton is familiar. He takes
convenient comfort from the Bible’s embrace of slavery, spends decades
resisting the possibility of his personal morality moving past its
conventions. He shows great empathy but applies it selectively. He
expands his circle of who counts as an Us, but only so far. We saw how
the person who emerges from the crowd to run into the burning building
typically acts before thinking, displaying an ingrained automaticity of
doing the harder, better thing. There’s no automaticity with Newton. We
can practically see his dlPFC laboring with all that rationalizing
—“There’s nothing I can do,” “It’s too big for one person to challenge,”
“Better to be concerned about the needy who are close to home,” “I can
use the profits from the investments for good works,” “Those people
really are so fundamentally different,” “I’m tired.” Yes, journeys begin
with a single step, but with Newton it’s ten steps forward, nine self-
serving ones back. Thompson’s moment of moral perfection feels as
unattainable to me as aspiring to be a gazelle or a waterfall or an
incandescent sunset. But there’s hope for us, with our foibles and
inconsistencies and frailties, as we watch Newton slowly lurch his way
toward being a moral titan.
