state of on/off switches on genes in the brain (to be covered in chapter
8).28
With chronic stress the nucleus accumbens is depleted of dopamine,
biasing rats toward social subordination and biasing humans toward
depression. As we saw in the last chapter, if a rodent wins a fight on his
home territory, there are long-lasting increases in levels of testosterone
receptors in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmentum, enhancing
testosterone’s pleasurable effects. There’s even a parasite called
Toxoplasma gondii that can infect the brain; over the course of weeks to
months, it makes rats less fearful of the smell of cats and makes humans
less fearful and more impulsive in subtle ways. Basically, most anything
you can measure in the nervous system can change in response to a
sustained stimulus. And importantly, these changes are often reversible
in a different environment.*
