our most prosocial concerning in-group morality when
our rapid, implicit emotions and intuitions dominate, but
are most prosocial concerning out-group morality when
cognition holds sway.
It’s easy to conclude that the PFC is about preventing
imprudent behaviors (“Don’t do it; you’ll regret it”). But
that isn’t always the case. For example, in chapter 17
we’ll consider the surprising amount of frontocortical
effort it can take to pull a trigger.
Like everything about the brain, the structure and
function of the frontal cortex vary enormously among
individuals; for example, resting metabolic rate in the
PFC varies approximately thirtyfold among people.*
What causes such individual differences? See the rest of
this book.74
“Doing the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.”
“Right” in this case is used in a neurobiological and
instrumental sense, rather than a moral one.
Consider lying. Obviously, the frontal cortex aids the
hard job of resisting the temptation. But it is also a
major frontocortical task, particularly a dlPFC task, to
lie competently, to control the emotional content of a
signal, to generate an abstract distance between message
and meaning. Interestingly, pathological liars have
atypically large amounts of white matter in the PFC,
indicating more complex wiring.75
But again, the “right thing,” in the setting of the frontal cortically
assisted lying, is amoral. An actor lies to an audience about having the
feelings of a morose Danish prince. A situationally ethical child lies,
telling Grandma how excited she is about her present, concealing the fact
that she already has that toy. A leader tells bold-faced lies, starting a war.
A financier with Ponzi in his blood defrauds investors. A peasant woman
lies to a uniformed thug, telling him she does not know the whereabouts
of the refugees she knows are hiding in her attic. As with much about the
frontal cortex, it’s context, context, context.
