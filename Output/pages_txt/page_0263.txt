GWAS techniques. Thus these traits are probably influenced by hundreds
of genes.61
What about behavior? A superb 2013 GWAS study examined the
genetic variants associated with educational attainment.62 The usual
over-the-top numbers—126,559 study subjects, about 180 authors. And
the most predictive genetic variant accounted for 0.02 percent—two
hundredths of one percent—of the variation. All the identified variants
together accounted for about 2 percent of the variation. A commentary
accompanying the paper contained this landmark of understatement: “In
short, educational attainment looks to be a very polygenic trait.”
Educational attainment—how many years of high school or college
one completes—is relatively easy to measure. How about the subtler,
messier behaviors that fill this book’s pages? A handful of studies have
tackled that, and the findings are much the same—at the end, you have a
list of scores of genes implicated and can then go figure out what they do
(logically, starting with the ones that showed the strongest statistical
associations). Hard, hard approaches that are still in their infancy. Made
worse by a GWAS missing more subtly variable spots,* meaning even
more genes are likely involved.63

As we conclude this section, some key points:64
a. This review of candidate genes barely scratches even the
surface of the surface. Go on PubMed (a major search
engine of the biomedical literature) and search “MAO
gene/behavior”—up come more than 500 research
papers. “Serotonin transporter gene/behavior”—1,250
papers. “Dopamine receptor gene/behavior”—nearly
2,000.
b. The candidate gene approaches show that the effect of a
single gene on a behavior is typically tiny. In other
words, having the “warrior gene” variant of MAO
probably has less effect on your behavior than does
believing that you have it.
c. Genomewide survey approaches show that these
behaviors are influenced by huge numbers of genes,
each one playing only a tiny role.
