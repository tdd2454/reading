* Such heterogeneity is hard to appreciate in the United States, where most African Americans descend from a few West
African tribes that constitute 1 to 2 percent of the total tribal variability in Africa. One of the consequences of this, the fact
that drugs are now marketed that preferentially target hypertension among African Americans, seemingly reifies the
biological race concept but actually tells you more about the biology of descendants of a small subset of West Africans than
about race as a whole.
