Hamilton showed that eusocial insects’ unique genetic system makes a
colony of ants, bees, or termites a single superorganism; asking why
worker ants forgo reproduction is like asking why your nose cells forgo
reproduction. In other words, eusocial insects constitute a unique type of
“group.” Williams then elaborated on how the more standard genetic
system, in species from noneusocial insects to us, was incompatible with
group selection. Animals don’t behave for the good of the species. They
behave to maximize the number of copies of their genes passed into the
next generation.*
This is the cornerstone of sociobiology and was summarized in
Dawkins’s famed sound bite that evolution is about “selfish genes.” Time
to see its building blocks.
