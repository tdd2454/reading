The Anticipation of Reward
Thus, dopamine is about invidious, rapidly habituating reward. But
dopamine is more interesting than that. Back to our well-trained monkey
working for a reward. A light comes on in his room, signaling the start of
a reward trial. He goes over to the lever, presses ten times, and gets the
raisin reward; this has happened often enough that there’s only a small
increase in dopamine with each raisin.
However, importantly, lots of dopamine is released when the light
first comes on, signaling the start of the reward trial, before the monkey
starts lever pressing.

In other words, once reward contingencies are learned, dopamine is
less about reward than about its anticipation. Similarly, work by my
Stanford colleague Brian Knutson has shown dopamine pathway
activation in people in anticipation of a monetary reward.91 Dopamine is
about mastery and expectation and confidence. It’s “I know how things
work; this is going to be great.” In other words, the pleasure is in the
anticipation of reward, and the reward itself is nearly an afterthought
(unless, of course, the reward fails to arrive, in which case it’s the most
important thing in the world). If you know your appetite will be sated,
pleasure is more about the appetite than about the sating.* This is hugely
important.
