* “Epigenetic” technically refers to altering the regulation of genes, rather than the sequence of genes. Therefore a
transcription factor activating some gene for ten minutes counts as epigenetic as well. When neuroscientists talk of the
“epigenetics revolution,” however, they’re almost always referring to the long-lasting mechanisms discussed here.
