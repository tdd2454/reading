* The central dogma of “information flows from DNA to RNA to protein” can be wrong. There are circumstances where
RNA can determine the sequence of DNA. This has lots to do with how some viruses work but isn’t relevant to us. Another
bit of revisionism, one that garnered two Nobel Prizes in 2006, is that a huge percentage of RNA does not then specify the
construction of some protein. Instead it can target and destroy other sequences of RNA, a phenomenon known as “RNA
interference.” Still other RNAs are created simply to render some segments of DNA itself “unreadable.”
