* I would be remiss not to touch on one issue in this field—when a new fear is learned, where is that memory stored? Next to
the amygdala is the hippocampus, which plays a key role in “explicit” learning about straightforward facts (e.g., someone’s
name). While the hippocampus is where short-term knowledge about the name is turned into long-term memory, the memory
trace itself is most likely in the cortex. The hippocampus, to use a metaphor that will probably be obsolete by the time this
book sees the light of day, is the keyboard, the conduit, the portal to the cortical hard drive where a memory is stored. Is the
amygdala solely the keyboard (with fear memories stored elsewhere), or is it the hard drive as well? This has been an
ongoing, unresolved debate in the field, with the “keyboard + hard drive” view championed by LeDoux and the keyboard-
alone view espoused by the equally accomplished scientist James McGaugh of the University of California at Irvine.
