thousand years ago and famously said, “Mirror neurons will do for
psychology what DNA did for biology.” I’m not trying to harp on
Ramachandran, but how can you resist someone brilliant handing out
sound bites like calling mirror neurons “Gandhi neurons”? And this
wasn’t just in the first heady days of mirror neurons in the early 1990s.
Two decades later he stated, “I don’t think [the importance of mirror
neurons for empathy is] being exaggerated. I think they’re being played
down, actually.”43
Ramachandran is certainly not alone. British philosopher Anthony
Grayling has gone for the empathy link big time, writing, “We have a
great gift for empathy. This is a biologically evolved capacity, as shown
by the function of ‘mirror neurons.’” In a 2007 New York Times article
about one man’s heroic actions to save another, those cells featured
again: “People have ‘mirror neurons,’ which make them feel what
someone else is experiencing” (emphasis added). And of course there
was my daughter’s six-year-old classmate who, upon the class being
complimented by their teacher for caring about the planet and cleaning
up after their Earth Day cupcake celebration, shouted out, “It’s because
our neurons have mirrors.”44
I’d like to think that I’m being a maverick here, ahead of the crowd
in terms of crucial thinking, but in recent years most in the field have
charged overhype. Psychologist Gary Marcus of NYU calls mirror
neurons “the most oversold idea in psychology,” philosopher and
neuroscientist Patricia Churchland of UCSD calls them the “darling of
the don’t-look-too-closely crew,” and Harvard’s Stephen Pinker
concludes, “Mirror neurons do not, in fact, explain language, empathy,
society, and world peace.”45 They simply haven’t been shown to have
much to do with this chapter’s concerns.
