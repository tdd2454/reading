HOBBES OR ROUSSEAU
Y
es, those guys.
To invoke some estimates, anatomically modern humans
emerged about 200,000 years ago, and behaviorally modern ones about
40,000 to 50,000 years ago; animal domestication is 10,000 to 20,000
years old, agriculture around 12,000. After plant domestication, it was
roughly 5,000 more years until “history” began with civilizations in
Egypt, the Mideast, China, and the New World. When in this arc of
history was war invented? Does material culture lessen or worsen
tendencies toward war? Do successful warriors leave more copies of
their genes? Has the centralization of authority by civilization actually
civilized us, providing a veneer of socially contractual restraint? Have
humans become more or less decent to one another over the course of
history? Yes, it’s short/nasty/brutish versus noble savage.
In contrast to the centuries of food fights among philosophers,
contemporary Hobbes-versus-Rousseau is about actual data. Some of it
is archaeological, where researchers have sought to determine the
prevalence and antiquity of warfare from the archaeological record.
Predictably, half of each conference on the subject consists of
definitional squabbles. Is “war” solely organized and sustained violence
between groups? Does it require weapons? A standing army (even if
only seasonally)? An army with hierarchy and chain of command? If
fighting is mostly along lines of relatedness, is it a vendetta or clan feud
instead of a war?
Fractured Bones
For most archaeologists the operational definition has been
streamlined to numerous people simultaneously meeting violent deaths.
In 1996 the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley of the University of Illinois
synthesized the existing literature in his highly influential War Before
Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage, ostensibly showing that
the archaeological evidence for war is broad and ancient.55
