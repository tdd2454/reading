* We will return to Greene’s subsequent “trolleyology” work at length in the chapter on morality. Broadly, it shows that the
differing decisions pivot around (a) the personal/impersonal contrast between pulling a lever and pushing with your own
hands, (b) the means/side effect contrast between the person’s death being a necessity and its being an unintentional by-
product, (c) the psychological distance to the potential victim.
