likely to preemptively stab the other player in the back. Thus, oxytocin
makes you more prosocial to people like you (i.e., your teammates) but
spontaneously lousy to Others who are a threat. As emphasized by De
Dreu, perhaps oxytocin evolved to enhance social competence to make
us better at identifying who is an Us.
In De Dreu’s second study, Dutch student subjects took the Implicit
Association Test of unconscious bias.* And oxytocin exaggerated biases
against two out-groups, namely Middle Easterners and Germans.47
Then came the study’s truly revealing second part. Subjects had to
decide whether it was okay to kill one person in order to save five. In the
scenario the potential sacrificial lamb’s name was either stereotypically
Dutch (Dirk or Peter), German (Markus or Helmut), or Middle Eastern
(Ahmed or Youssef); the five people in danger were unnamed.
Remarkably, oxytocin made subjects less likely to sacrifice good ol’ Dirk
or Peter, rather than Helmut or Ahmed.
Oxytocin, the luv hormone, makes us more prosocial to Us and
worse to everyone else. That’s not generic prosociality. That’s
ethnocentrism and xenophobia. In other words, the actions of these
neuropeptides depend dramatically on context—who you are, your
environment, and who that person is. As we will see in chapter 8, the
same applies to the regulation of genes relevant to these neuropeptides.
