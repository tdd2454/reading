CONCLUSIONS
N
o brain operates in a vacuum, and over the course of seconds to
minutes, the wealth of information streaming into the brain
influences the likelihood of pro- or antisocial acts. As we’ve seen,
pertinent information ranges from something as simple and
unidimensional as shirt color to things as complex and subtle as cues
about ideology. Moreover, the brain also constantly receives
interoceptive information. And most important, much of these varied
types of information is subliminal. Ultimately, the most important point
of this chapter is that in the moments just before we decide upon some of
our most consequential acts, we are less rational and autonomous
decision makers than we like to think.
