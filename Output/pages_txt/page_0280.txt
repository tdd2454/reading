absolute length of lines, the other two at relative judgments; when shown
a glove, a scarf, and a hand, herders grouped gloves and scarves
categorically, while the others grouped relationally, pairing gloves and
hands. In the authors’ words, “social interdependence fosters holistic
thinking.”
This theme appears in another study, comparing Jewish boys from
either observant Orthodox homes (dominated by endless shared rules
about beliefs and behaviors) with ones from far more individualist
secular homes. Visual processing was more holistic in the Orthodox,
more focused in the secular.24
The East Asian/Western collectivist/individualist dichotomy has a
fascinating genetic correlate.25 Recall from the last chapter dopamine
and DRD4, the gene for the D4 receptor. It’s extraordinarily variable,
with at least twenty-five human variants (with lesser variability in other
primates). Moreover, the variation isn’t random, inconsequential drift of
DNA sequences; instead there has been strong positive selection for
variants. Most common is the 4R variant, occurring in about half of East
Asians and European Americans. There’s also the 7R variant, producing
a receptor less responsive to dopamine in the cortex, associated with
novelty seeking, extroversion, and impulsivity. It predates modern
humans but became dramatically more common ten to twenty thousand
years ago. The 7R variant occurs in about 23 percent of Europeans and
European Americans. And in East Asians? 1 percent.
