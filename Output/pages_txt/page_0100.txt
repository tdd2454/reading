TESTOSTERONE’S BUM RAP
T
estosterone is secreted by the testes as the final step in the
“hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular” axis; it has effects on cells
throughout the body (including neurons, of course). And testosterone is
everyone’s usual suspect when it comes to the hormonal causes of
aggression.
Correlation and Causality
Why is it that throughout the animal kingdom, and in every human
culture, males account for most aggression and violence? Well, what
about testosterone and some related hormones (collectively called
“androgens,” a term that, unless otherwise noted, I will use simplistically
as synonymous with “testosterone”)? In nearly all species males have
more circulating testosterone than do females (who secrete small
amounts of androgens from the adrenal glands). Moreover, male
aggression is most prevalent when testosterone levels are highest
(adolescence, and during mating season in seasonal breeders).
Thus, testosterone and aggression are linked. Furthermore, there are
particularly high levels of testosterone receptors in the amygdala, in the
way station by which it projects to the rest of the brain (the bed nucleus
of the stria terminalis), and in its major targets (the hypothalamus, the
central gray of the midbrain, and the frontal cortex). But these are merely
correlative data. Showing that testosterone causes aggression requires a
“subtraction” plus a “replacement” experiment. Subtraction—castrate a
male. Do levels of aggression decrease? Yes (including in humans). This
shows that something coming from the testes causes aggression. Is it
testosterone? Replacement—give that castrated individual replacement
testosterone. Do precastration levels of aggression return? Yes (including
in humans).
Thus, testosterone causes aggression. Time to see how wrong that is.
The first hint of a complication comes after castration, when average
levels of aggression plummet in every species. But, crucially, not to zero.
