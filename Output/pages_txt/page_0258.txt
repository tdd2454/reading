These findings are not consistent, no doubt reflecting
unrecognized gene/environment interactions.
Again, why should the COMT world be related to
sensation seeking, while there are the DAT people and
their happy faces? Both genes are about ending
dopamine signaling. This is probably related to different
parts of the brain differing as to whether DAT or COMT
plays a bigger role.53
The COMT literature is majorly messy, for the
inconvenient reason that the enzyme also degrades
norepinephrine. So COMT variants are pertinent to two
totally different neurotransmitter systems.
These effects are tiny. For example, knowing which
DRD4 variant someone has explains only 3 to 4 percent
of the variation in novelty-seeking behavior.
The final piece of confusion seems most important but is
least considered in the literature (probably because it
would be premature). Suppose that every study shows
with whopping clarity and consistency that a DRD4
variant is highly predictive of novelty seeking. That still
doesn’t tell us why for some people novelty seeking
means frequently switching their openings in chess
games, while for others it means looking for a new
locale because it’s getting stale being a mercenary in the
Congo. No gene or handful of genes that we are aware
of will tell us much about that.
The Neuropeptides Oxytocin and Vasopressin
Time for a quick recap from chapter 4. Oxytocin and vasopressin are
involved in prosociality, ranging from parent/offspring bonds to
monogamous bonds to trust, empathy, generosity, and social intelligence.
Recall the caveats: (a) sometimes these neuropeptides are more about
sociality than prosociality (in other words, boosting social information
gathering, rather than acting prosocially with that information); (b) they
most consistently boost prosociality in people who already lean in that
direction (e.g., making generous people more generous, while having no
effect on ungenerous people); and (c) the prosocial effects are within
