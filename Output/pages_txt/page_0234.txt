induces transpositions in particular cells, where the plant metaphorically
shuffles its DNA deck, hoping to generate some novel savior of a
protein.
Mammals have fewer transposons than plants. The immune system is
one transposon hot spot, in the enormous stretches of DNA coding for
antibodies. A novel virus invades; shuffling the DNA increases the odds
of coming up with an antibody that will target the invader.*
The main point here is that transposons occur in the brain.11 In
humans transpositional events occur in stem cells in the brain when they
are becoming neurons, making the brain a mosaic of neurons with
different DNA sequences. In other words, when you make neurons, that
boring DNA sequence you inherited isn’t good enough. Remarkably,
transpositional events occur in neurons that form memories in fruit flies.
Even flies evolved such that their neurons are freed from the strict
genetic marching orders they inherit.
Chance
Finally, chance lessens genes as the Code of Codes. Chance, driven
by Brownian motion—the random movement of particles in a fluid—has
big effects on tiny things like molecules floating in cells, including
molecules regulating gene transcription.12 This influences how quickly
an activated TF reaches the DNA, splicing enzymes bump into target
stretches of RNA, and an enzyme synthesizing something grabs the two
precursor molecules needed for the synthesis. I’ll stop here; otherwise,
I’ll go on for hours.
Some Key Points, Completing This Part of the
Chapter
a. Genes are not autonomous agents commanding
biological events.
b. Instead, genes are regulated by the environment, with
“environment” consisting of everything from events
inside the cell to the universe.
c. Much of your DNA turns environmental influences into
gene transcription, rather than coding for genes
