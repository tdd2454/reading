they are mature enough. Sandra Day O’Connor, in
dissenting from the Roper decision, wrote, “The fact that
juveniles are generally less culpable for their
misconduct than adults does not necessarily mean that a
17-year-old murderer cannot be sufficiently culpable to
merit the death penalty” (her emphasis). Another
dissenter, the late Antonin Scalia, wrote that it is “absurd
to think that one must be mature enough to drive
carefully, to drink responsibly, or to vote intelligently, in
order to be mature enough to understand that murdering
another human being is profoundly wrong.”11
Amid these differing opinions everyone, including O’Connor and
Scalia, agrees that there exist age-related boundaries on free will—
everyone’s homunculus was once too young to have its adult powers.12
Maybe it wasn’t tall enough yet to reach all the control dials; maybe it
was distracted from its job by fretting about that gross pimple on its
forehead. And that needs to be considered during legal judgments. Just
as with piglets and pigs, it’s just an issue of when a homunculus is old
enough.
The Nature and Magnitude of Brain Damage
Essentially everyone working with a model of mitigated free will
accepts that if there is enough brain damage, responsibility for a criminal
act goes out the window. Even Stephen Morse of the University of
Pennsylvania, a strident critic of neuroscience in the courtroom (much
more later), concedes, “Suppose we could show that the higher
deliberative centers in the brain seem to be disabled in these cases. If
these are people who cannot control episodes of gross irrationality,
we’ve learned something that might be relevant to the legal ascription of
responsibility.”13 In this view, mitigating biological factors are relevant if
the capacity for reasoning has been grossly impaired.
Thus, if someone had their entire frontal cortex destroyed, you
probably shouldn’t hold them responsible for their actions, because their
rationality is grossly impaired when deciding their own courses of
action.14 But the issue then becomes where a line is drawn on a
