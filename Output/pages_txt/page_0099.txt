Four
Hours to Days Before
W
e now take the next step back in our chronology, considering
events from hours to days before a behavior occurs. To do so,
we enter the realm of hormones. What are the effects of hormones on the
brain and sensory systems that filled the last two chapters? How do
hormones influence our best and worst behaviors?
While this chapter examines various hormones, the most attention is
paid to one inextricably tied to aggression, namely testosterone. And as
the punch line, testosterone is far less relevant to aggression than usually
assumed. At the other end of the spectrum, the chapter also considers a
hormone with cult status for fostering warm, fuzzy prosociality, namely
oxytocin. As we’ll see, it’s not quite as groovy as assumed.
Those who are unfamiliar with hormones and endocrinology, please
see the primer in appendix 2.
