arious muscles have moved, and a behavior has happened.
Perhaps it is a good act: you’ve empathically touched the arm of
a suffering person. Perhaps it is a foul act: you’ve pulled a trigger,
targeting an innocent person. Perhaps it is a good act: you’ve pulled a
trigger, drawing fire to save others. Perhaps it is a foul act: you’ve
touched the arm of someone, starting a chain of libidinal events that
betray a loved one. Acts that, as emphasized, are definable only by
context.
Thus, to ask the question that will begin this and the next eight
chapters, why did that behavior occur?
As this book’s starting point, we know that different disciplines
produce different answers—because of some hormone; because of
evolution; because of childhood experiences or genes or culture—and as
the book’s central premise, these are utterly intertwined answers, none
standing alone. But on the most proximal level, in this chapter we ask:
What happened one second before the behavior that caused it to occur?
This puts us in the realm of neurobiology, of understanding the brain that
commanded those muscles.
This chapter is one of the book’s anchors. The brain is the final
common pathway, the conduit that mediates the influences of all the
distal factors to be covered in the chapters to come. What happened an
hour, a decade, a million years earlier? What happened were factors that
impacted the brain and the behavior it produced.
This chapter has two major challenges. The first is its god-awful
length. Apologies; I’ve tried to be succinct and nontechnical, but this is
foundational material that needs to be covered. Second, regardless of
how nontechnical I’ve tried to be, the material can overwhelm someone
