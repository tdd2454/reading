Breakfast time, as garbage is dumped from a cart
Somehow baboons in “my” troop got word of the feasting over the
hill, and soon half a dozen would head over each morning to join. It
wasn’t random who did this, who would try to compete for food against
fifty or sixty Thems. The ones who tried were male, big, and aggressive.
And morning is when baboons do much of their socializing—sitting in
contact, grooming, playing—so going for garbage meant forgoing the
socializing. The males who went each morning were the most
aggressive, least affiliative members of the troop.
Not long after, there was a tuberculosis outbreak among the Garbage
Dump baboons. In humans tuberculosis is a chronic disease, slowly
consuming you with “consumption.” In nonhuman primates, TB is
wildfire, spreading rapidly, killing within weeks. Kenyan wildlife vet
colleagues and I identified the cause of the outbreak—the meat inspector
at the lodge was being bribed to approve tubercular cows for slaughter;
animals were killed, unsightly lesionish organs discarded and then
consumed by baboons. Most of the Garbage Dump troop died, as did all
my males who raided the dump.47
This was kinda upsetting to me; I habituated a new troop at the other
end of the park and wouldn’t go anywhere near the remnants of my troop
for half a dozen years. Finally, my soon-to-be wife visiting Kenya for the
first time, I worked up the nerve to return to the troop, to show her the
baboons of my youth.
