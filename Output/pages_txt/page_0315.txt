Moreover, his report of increased reproductive success
among more murderous Yanomamö has been
demolished by the anthropologist Douglas Fry of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, who showed that
Chagnon’s finding is an artifact of poor data analysis:
Chagnon compared the number of descendants of older
men who had killed people in battle with those who had
not, finding significantly more kids among the former.
However: (a) Chagnon did not control for age
differences—the killers happened to be an average of
more than a decade older than the nonkillers, meaning
more than a decade more time to accumulate
descendants. (b) More important, this was the wrong
analysis to answer the question posed—the issue isn’t
the reproductive success of elderly men who had been
killers in their youth. You need to consider the
reproductive success of all killers, including the many
who were themselves killed as young warriors, distinctly
curtailing their reproductive success. Not doing so is
like concluding that war is not lethal, based solely on
studies of war veterans.
Moreover, Chagnon’s finding does not generalize—at
least three studies of other cultures fail to find a
violence/reproductive success link. For example, a study
by Luke Glowacki and Richard Wrangham of Harvard
examined a nomadic pastoralist tribe, the Nyangatom of
southern Ethiopia. Like other pastoralists in their region,
the Nyangatom regularly raid one another for cattle.65
The authors found that frequent participation in large,
open battle raiding did not predict increased lifelong
reproductive success. Instead such success was
predicted by frequent participation in “stealth raiding,”
where a small group furtively steals cows from the
enemy at night. In other words, in this culture being a
warrior on ’roids does not predict amply passing on your
genes; being a low-down sneaky varmint of a cattle
rustler does.
