* There is a great contemporary version of human ritualistic aggression, namely the haka ritual performed by rugby teams
from New Zealand. Just before the game starts, the Kiwis line up midfield and perform this neo-Maori war dance, complete
with rhythmic stamping, menacing gestures, guttural shouting, and histrionically threatening facial expressions. It’s cool to
see from afar on YouTube (even better is watching the YouTube clip of Robin Williams doing a haka display at Charlie Rose
on PBS), while up close it typically appears to scare the bejesus out of the other team. However, some opposing teams have
come up with ritualistic responses straight out of the baboon playbook—getting in the haka-ers’ faces and trying to stare
them down. Other teams come out with ritualistic responses that are pure human uniqueness—ignoring the haka-ers while
nonchalantly warming up; using their smartphones to film the display, thereby emasculating it to something vaguely touristy
in flavor; tepidly applauding afterward with great condescension. One response initially seems uniquely human but would be
understandable to other primates after some translating—the sports newsletter for one Australian team printed a photo of the
mortal enemy New Zealanders doing a haka, with each player brandishing a Photoshopped woman’s handbag.
