larger the neocortex, relative to total brain size. Dunbar’s influential
“social brain hypothesis” posits that increases in social complexity and
the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex have been linked. This link
also occurs within species. Among some primates, group size can vary
tenfold (depending on the richness of the ecosystem). This was modeled
in a fascinating neuroimaging study, in which captive macaque monkeys
were housed in different-sized groups; the bigger the group, the more
thickening of the prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal gyrus, a
cortical region involved in Theory of Mind, and the tighter the activity
coupling between the two.*3
Thus primate social complexity and big brains go together. This is
shown further by examining fission-fusion species, where the size of the
social group regularly changes dramatically. Baboons, for example, start
and end the day in a large, coherent troop, whereas midday foraging
occurs in small groups. As other examples, hyenas hunt in groups but
scavenge individually, and wolves often do the opposite.
Sociality is more complex in fission-fusion species. You must
remember if someone’s rank differs when in a subgroup versus the entire
group. Being away from someone all day makes it tempting to see if
dominance relations have changed since breakfast.
One study compared fission-fusion primates (chimps, bonobos,
orangutans, spider monkeys) and non-fission-fusion (gorillas, capuchins,
long-tailed macaques).4 Among these captive animals, fission-fusion
species were better at frontocortical tasks and had larger neocortices
relative to total brain size. Studies of corvids (crows, ravens, magpies,
jackdaws) showed the same thing.
Thus “rank” and “hierarchy” in other animals is anything but
straightforward and varies considerably depending on the species,
gender, and social group.
