There have been other singular acts. In the mid-1980s a
commemoration was being held at the Pearl Harbor Memorial on the
anniversary of the attack. A group of survivors who had gathered were
approached by an elderly man. This was his third trip to the memorial,
trying to work up his nerve. He approached the survivors and, in halting

The man, Zenji Abe, was a fighter pilot in the 1937 Japanese
invasion of China and throughout the Pacific during World War II—
including helping to lead the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Little in his earlier life predicted Abe’s apologizing as an old man.
His inculcation into war started early, when he joined a military academy

like a training exercise. His sense of responsibility could readily have
been blunted, as the bomb he dropped hadn’t detonated. And his country

Some things favored Abe’s gesture. He had been captured and spent

about the attack—pilots had been told that war against America had been
