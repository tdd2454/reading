* For example, the “fusiform face area” is more responsive to faces in ovulating women than in those menstruating.
Similarly, the “emotional” vmPFC is more responsive to men’s faces when women are approaching ovulation than when they
are approaching menses; the higher the ratio of estrogen to progesterone in the bloodstream during that preovulatory phase,
the more vmPFC responsiveness. Finally, women find faces of men judged to look “aggressive” to be more attractive when
they are ovulating.
