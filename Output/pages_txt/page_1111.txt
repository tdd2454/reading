* This one puzzles me intensely. When I was a kid, I decided that bullies would be nicer to me if I knew vast amounts about
football. This was during the glory days of the Packers in the Vince Lombardi era; thus I decided that they were the team I
favored. I memorized and irritatingly spouted every pointless bit of trivia I could find on them, watched my first (and pretty
much only) football game, which turned out to be the Packers legendarily defeating the Cowboys for the 1967 championship
with a fourth-down touchdown from the one-yard line, with sixteen seconds remaining, played in minus-fifteen-degree
weather. And that’s it. My football obsession faded when I decided that knowing baseball factoids would be more
advantageous (this was fortuitous, living in Brooklyn—soon after came the miraculous 1969 championship season for the
hapless Mets). I’ve never been to a professional football game, can’t tell you anything about the Packers since (I don’t even
know if Bart Starr is still their quarterback, but it wouldn’t surprise me one bit if he’s retired by now), basically ignore
football. Yet almost fifty years later, if I happen to hear once every few years that the Packers are having a good or bad
season, my mood is briefly influenced by the news; if I see a photograph of people playing football and they include the
Packers, I’m sure I preferentially look at them versus the other team, am made fleetingly happy by it being them; I felt
excited the one time I met someone from Green Bay and, after thirty seconds of chatting pointlessly with them about the
Packers of the sixties, felt a near-spiritual connection with them. It’s just plain weird. And sure demonstrates the unlikely
power that “belonging” can have.
