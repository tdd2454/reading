T
he year 2008 marked a human milestone, a transition point nine
thousand years in the making: for the first time, the majority of
humans lived in cities.
The human trajectory from semipermanent settlements to the
megalopolis has been beneficial. In the developed world, when
compared with rural populations, city dwellers are typically healthier and
wealthier; larger social networks facilitate innovation; because of
economies of scale, cities leave a smaller per-capita ecological
footprint.42
Urban living makes for a different sort of brain. This was shown in a
2011 study of subjects from a range of cities, towns, and rural settings
who underwent an experimental social stressor while being brain-
scanned. The key finding was that the larger the population where
someone lived, the more reactive their amygdala was during that
stressor.*43
Most important for our purposes, urbanized humans do something
completely unprecedented among primates—regularly encountering
strangers who are never seen again, fostering the invention of the
anonymous act. After all, it wasn’t until nineteenth-century urbanization
that crime fiction was invented, typically set in cities—in traditional
settings there’s no whodunit, since everyone knows what everyone dun.
Growing cultures had to invent mechanisms for norm enforcement
among strangers. For example, across numerous traditional cultures, the
larger the group, the greater the punishment for norm violations and the
more cultural emphases on equitable treatment of strangers. Moreover,
larger groups evolved “third-party punishment” (stay tuned for more in
the next chapter)—rather than victims punishing norm violators,
punishment is meted out by objective third parties, such as police and
courts. At an extreme, a crime not only victimizes its victim but also is
