know of no expert who thinks the technique is
sufficiently accurate. Nonetheless, there are
entrepreneurs selling the approach (including, I kid you

to lower-tech but equally unreliable versions of is-that-
brain-lying? This includes electroencephalograms
(EEGs), which are admissible in Indian courtrooms.3
What should be the IQ cutoff for someone to be smart

resembling a liberal approach to reforming criminal justice. The reason
