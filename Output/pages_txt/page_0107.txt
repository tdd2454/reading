OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN: A
MARKETING DREAM
I
f the point of the preceding section is that testosterone has gotten a
bum rap, the point of this one is that oxytocin (and the closely related
vasopressin) is coasting in a Teflon presidency. According to lore,
oxytocin makes organisms less aggressive, more socially attuned,
trusting, and empathic. Individuals treated with oxytocin become more
faithful partners and more attentive parents. It makes lab rats more
charitable and better listeners, makes fruit flies sing like Joan Baez.
Naturally, things are more complicated, and oxytocin has an informative
dark side.
Basics
Oxytocin and vasopressin are chemically similar hormones; the DNA
sequences that constitute their genes are similar, and the two genes occur
close to each other on the same chromosome. There was a single
ancestral gene that, a few hundred million years ago, was accidentally
“duplicated” in the genome, and the DNA sequences in the two copies of
the gene drifted independently, evolving into two closely related genes
(stay tuned for more in chapter 8). This gene duplication occurred as
mammals were emerging; other vertebrates have only the ancestral
version, called vasotocin, which is structurally between the two separate
mammalian hormones.
For twentieth-century neurobiologists, oxytocin and vasopressin
were pretty boring. They were made in hypothalamic neurons that sent
axons to the posterior pituitary. There they would be released into
circulation, thereby attaining hormone status, and have nothing to do
with the brain ever again. Oxytocin stimulated uterine contraction during
labor and milk letdown afterward. Vasopressin (aka “antidiuretic
hormone”) regulated water retention in the kidneys. And reflecting their
similar structures, each also had mild versions of the other one’s effects.
End of story.
