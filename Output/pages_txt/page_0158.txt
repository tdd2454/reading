Frontal Cortical Changes in Emotional Regulation
Older teenagers experience emotions more intensely than do children
or adults, something obvious to anyone who ever spent time as a
teenager. For example, they are more reactive to faces expressing strong
emotions.*11 In adults, looking at an “affective facial display” activates
the amygdala, followed by activation of the emotion-regulating vmPFC
as they habituate to the emotional content. In adolescence, though, the
vmPFC response is less; thus the amygdaloid response keeps growing.
Chapter 2 introduced “reappraisal,” in which responses to strong
emotional stimuli are regulated by thinking about them differently.12 Get
a bad grade on an exam, and there’s an emotional pull toward “I’m
stupid”; reappraisal might lead you instead to focus on your not having
studied or having had a cold, to decide that the outcome was situational,
rather than a function of your unchangeable constitution.
Reappraisal strategies get better during adolescence, with logical
neurobiological underpinnings. Recall how in early adolescence, the
ventral striatum, trying to be helpful, takes on some frontal tasks (fairly
ineffectively, as it’s working above its pay grade). At that age reappraisal
engages the ventral striatum; more activation predicts less amygdaloid
activation and better emotional regulation. As the adolescent matures,
the prefrontal cortex takes over the task, and emotions get steadier.*13
Bringing the striatum into the picture brings up dopamine and
reward, thus bringing up the predilection of adolescents for bungee
jumping.
