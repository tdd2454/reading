* Which, among other things, is why the nervous system is so vulnerable to injury. Someone has a cardiac arrest. Their heart
stops for a few minutes before it is shocked into beating again, and during those few minutes the entire body is deprived of
blood, of oxygen and glucose. And at the end of those few minutes of “hypoxia-ischemia,” every cell in the body is miserable
and queasy. Yet it is preferentially brain cells (and a consistent subset of them) that are now destined to die over the next few
days.
