* Two important points: This intergroup bias effect was demonstrable in males but not females and was most pronounced
when males were looking at pictures of other males. Second, shortly after publication the paper was retracted; apparently a
data-coding error called into question some of the findings; however, those described here were unaltered by this error, and I
think they are perfectly valid. Out of commendable cautiousness, the authors, all top researchers, retracted the paper.
