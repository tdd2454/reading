But if the mutation codes for an amino acid that produces a protein
with a dramatically different shape, the consequences can be enormous
(even fatal).
Back to
“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”
What if there is a mutation in a nucleotide helping to code for the
first w, a mutation with a big consequence?
“I/am/not/going/to/do/the/following”
Trouble.
The next type of classical mutation is called a deletion mutation. In
this scenario a copying error is made during the inheritance of a gene.
But instead of a nucleotide being miscopied, it is deleted. For example,
in a case where the seventh nucleotide is deleted,
“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”
becomes
“I/am/now/oingt/od/ot/hef/ollowing”
This can frameshift everything over to generate gibberish, or even a
different message (e.g., “For dessert I’d like the mousse” mutating to
“For dessert I’d like the mouse”).
Deletion mutations can involve the loss of more than a single
nucleotide. At an extreme, this can involve the deletion of the entire
gene, or even a stretch of genes on a particular chromosome. Definitely
not good.
Finally, there are insertion mutations. During copying of the DNA to
pass on to the next generation, a nucleotide is inadvertently copied twice,
duplicated. Thus:
“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”
becomes
“I/am/now/ggoin/gt/od/oth/efollowin”
Gibberish, or perhaps a different message, as in the following case,
where an e has been inserted near the end of the string of letters: “Mary
turned John down for a date because she did not enjoy boweling.” In
some cases an insertion mutation can involve the insertion of more than a
single nucleotide. At an extreme, this can even involve the duplication of
an entire gene.
Point, deletion, and insertion mutations are most of what mutations
are about.* Deletion and insertion mutations often have major
