* Findings like this should not be confused with the rationale behind the “Twinkie defense.” In 1978 San Francisco mayor
George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk—the first openly gay politician in California—were assassinated by Dan
White, a disgruntled ex-supervisor. According to the common misconception, during his trial, White’s defense attorneys
argued that his addiction to sugary junk food somehow impaired his judgment and self-control. In reality, the defense argued
that White suffered from diminished capacity because of his depression, and his shift from a healthy diet to one of junk food
was merely evidence of his depressed state.
