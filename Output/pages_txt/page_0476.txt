And then we’re unlike any other species on earth in that
we belong to multiple hierarchies, are psychologically
adept at overvaluing those in which we excel, and
maintain internal standards that can trump objective
rank in their impact.
Humans committed themselves to a unique trajectory
when we invented socioeconomic status. In terms of its
caustic, scarring impact on minds and bodies, nothing in
the history of animals being crappy to one another about
status differences comes within light-years of our
invention of poverty.
We’re really out there as a species in that sometimes our
high-status individuals don’t merely plunder and instead
actually lead, actually attempt to facilitate the common
good. We’ve even developed bottom-up mechanisms for
collectively choosing such leaders on occasion. A
magnificent achievement. Which we then soil by having
our choosing of leaders be shaped by implicit, automatic
factors more suitable to five-year-olds deciding who
should captain their boat on a voyage with the
Teletubbies to Candyland.
Stripped to their idealistic core, our political differences
concern differing visions of how best to bring about the
common good. We tend to come as internally consistent
packages of political stances ranging from the small and
local to the mammoth and global. And with remarkable
regularity our stances reflect our implicit, affective
makeup, with cognition playing post-hoc catch up. If
you really want to understand someone’s politics,
understand their cognitive load, how prone they are to
snap judgments, their approaches to reappraisal and
resolving cognitive dissonance. Even more important,
understand how they feel about novelty, ambiguity,
empathy, hygiene, disease and dis-ease, and whether
things used to be better and the future is a scary place.
Like so many other animals, we have an often-frantic
need to conform, belong, and obey. Such conformity can
be markedly maladaptive, as we forgo better solutions in
