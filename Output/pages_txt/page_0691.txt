These housekeeping steps are hugely important. Suppose you want to
increase the amount of neurotransmitter signaling across a synapse. Let’s
translate that into the excitation terms of the previous section—you want
to increase excitability across the synapse, such that an action potential
in the presynaptic neuron has more of an oomph in the postsynaptic
neuron, which is to say it has an increased likelihood of causing an
action potential in that second neuron. You could increase the amount of
neurotransmitter released—the presynaptic neuron yells louder. Or you
could increase the amount of receptor on the dendritic spine—the
postsynaptic neuron is listening more acutely.
But as another possibility, you could decrease the activity of the
reuptake pump. As a result, less of the neurotransmitter is removed from
the synapse. Thus it sticks around longer and binds to the receptors
repeatedly, amplifying the signal. Or, as the conceptual equivalent, you
could decrease the activity of the degradative enzyme; less
neurotransmitter is broken down, so more sticks around longer in the
synapse, having an enhanced effect. As we saw, some of the most
interesting findings that help explain individual differences in the
behaviors that concern us in this book relate to amounts of
neurotransmitter made and released, and the amounts and functioning of
the receptors, reuptake pumps, and degradative enzymes.
