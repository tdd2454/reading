* Related to this was the notion that most of the evolution of behavior was not about dealing with the social complexities of
fellow species members but about dealing with abiotic (i.e., nonbiological) pressures. In other words, that behavior evolved
mostly for dealing with the environment, rather than for competing with other individuals. Again, the main implication of that
for our purposes is that it would be another way in which the gradualist importance of interindividual competition was less
than the sociobiologists thought. This emphasis on the importance of abiotic selective pressures was common among Soviet
evolutionary biologists, probably reflecting not only the Marxist ideology but also the awful winters.
