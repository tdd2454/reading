that offspring of more “attentive” rat mothers (those that frequently
nurse, groom, and lick their pups) become adults with lower
glucocorticoid levels, less anxiety, better learning, and delayed brain
aging. The paper showed that these changes were epigenetic—that
mothering style altered the on/off switch in a gene relevant to the brain’s
stress response.* Whoa—mothering style alters gene regulation in pups’
brains. Remarkably, Meaney, along with Darlene Francis of the
University of California, Berkeley, then showed that such rat pups, as
adults, are more attentive mothers—passing this trait epigenetically to
the next generation.* Thus, adult behavior produces persistent molecular
brain changes in offspring, “programming” them to be likely to replicate
that distinctive behavior in adulthood.76
More findings flooded in, many provided by Meaney, his
collaborator Moshe Szyf, also of McGill, and Frances Champagne of
Columbia University.77 Hormonal responses to various fetal and
childhood experiences have epigenetic effects on genes related to the
growth factor BDNF, to the vasopressin and oxytocin system, and to
estrogen sensitivity. These effects are pertinent to adult cognition,
personality, emotionality, and psychiatric health. Childhood abuse, for
example, causes epigenetic changes in hundreds of genes in the human
hippocampus. Moreover, Stephen Suomi of the National Institutes of
Health and Szyf found that mothering style in monkeys has epigenetic
effects on more than a thousand frontocortical genes.*
This is totally revolutionary. Sort of. Which segues to a chapter
summary.
