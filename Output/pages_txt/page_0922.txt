* Hyenas have a terrible reputation, thanks to outdated zoology that characterizes them, sneeringly, as “scavengers”
(snarkiness that makes little sense, given that most of us just scavenge dead stuff in the supermarket). Rather than living off
the scraps of lions’ kills, they are highly effective hunters. Most often, it is scavenging lions trying to drive hyenas off a kill,
rather than the other way around. And real hyenas don’t sing inane songs like in The Lion King.
