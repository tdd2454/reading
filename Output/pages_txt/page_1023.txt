* Harking back to how the noncoding regulatory regions of the genome are at least as important as regions that code for
genes themselves, the 5HTT variants do not differ in the DNA sequence of the gene but rather in the sequence of a promoter
for the gene. As a result, the two variants differ in their sensitivity to a transcription factor, and thus in the amount of
transporter protein made.
