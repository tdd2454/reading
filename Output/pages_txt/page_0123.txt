STRESS AND IMPRUDENT BRAIN
FUNCTION
T
he time before some of our most important, consequential
behaviors can be filled with stress. Which is too bad, since stress
influences the decisions we make, rarely for the better.
The Basic Dichotomy of the Acute and the Chronic
Stress Response
We begin with a long-forgotten term from ninth-grade biology.
Remember “homeostasis”? It means having an ideal body temperature,
heart rate, glucose level, and so on. A “stressor” is anything that disrupts
homeostatic balance—say, being chased by a lion if you’re a zebra, or
chasing after a zebra if you’re a hungry lion. The stress response is the
array of neural and endocrine changes that occur in that zebra or lion,
designed to get them through that crisis and reestablish homeostasis.*67
Critical events in the brain mediate the start of the stress response.
(Warning: the next two paragraphs are technical and not essential.) The
sight of the lion activates the amygdala; amygdaloid neurons stimulate
brain-stem neurons, which then inhibit the parasympathetic nervous
system and mobilize the sympathetic nervous system, releasing
epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the body.
The amygdala also mediates the other main branch of the stress
response, activating the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the
hypothalamus. And the PVN sends projections to the base of the
hypothalamus, where it secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH);
this triggers the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH), which stimulates glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenals.
Glucocorticoids plus the sympathetic nervous system enable an
organism to survive a physical stressor by activating the classical “fight
or flight” response. Whether you are that zebra or that lion, you’ll need
energy for your muscles, and the stress response rapidly mobilizes
energy into circulation from storage sites in your body. Furthermore,
