othing comes from nothing. No brain is an island.
Thanks to messages bouncing around your brain, a command
has been sent to your muscles to pull that trigger or touch that arm. Odds
are that a short time earlier, something outside your brain prompted this
to happen, raising this chapter’s key questions: (a) What outside
stimulus, acting through what sensory channel and targeting which parts
of the brain, prompted this? (b) Were you aware of that environmental
stimulus? (c) What stimuli had your brain made you particularly
sensitive to? And, of course, (d) what does this tell us about our best and
worst behaviors?
Varied sensory information can prompt the brain into action. This can
be appreciated by considering this variety in other species. Often we’re
clueless about this because animals can sense things in ranges that we
can’t, or with sensory modalities we didn’t know exist. Thus, you must
think like the animal to learn what is happening. We’ll begin by seeing
how this pertains to the field of ethology, the science of interviewing an
animal in its own language.
