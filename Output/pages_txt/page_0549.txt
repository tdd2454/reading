the one with the good luck when some of the reward is
transferred afterward to make things more even. Thus it’s little
surprise in the present study that subjects made happy by
reducing inequity, even at a cost to themselves, were also the
most charitable. The authors appropriately interpret this as
reflecting a compassionate act with elements independent of self-
interest.57
c. There was more dopaminergic activation (and more self-
reports of satisfaction) when people gave voluntarily than when
they were taxed. In other words, a component of the charitability
was about self-interest—it was more pleasing when those in
need were helped by voluntary efforts than when giving was
forced.
What does this show? That we’re reinforced by varying things and to
varying extents—getting money, knowing that the needy are being cared
for, feeling the warm glow of doing a good thing. And that it is rare to be
able to get the second type of pleasure with no dependence on the third
—it appears to truly be rare to scratch an altruist and see an altruist
bleed.
