A similar conclusion comes in the 2011 book The Better Angels of
Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, by Harvard’s Steven Pinker.56
Cliché police be damned, you can’t mention this book without calling it
“monumental.” In this monumental work Pinker argued that (a) violence
and the worst horrors of inhumanity have been declining for the last half
millennium, thanks to the constraining forces of civilization; and (b) the
warfare and barbarity preceding that transition are as old as the human
species.
Keeley and Pinker document savagery galore in prehistoric tribal
societies—mass graves filled with skeletons bearing multiple fractures,
caved-in skulls, “parrying” fractures (which arise from raising your arm
to fend off a blow), stone projectiles embedded in bone. Some sites
suggest the outcome of battle—a preponderance of young adult male
skeletons. Others suggest indiscriminate massacre—butchered skeletons
of both sexes and all ages. Other sites suggest cannibalism of the
vanquished.
In their separate surveys of the literature, Keeley and Pinker present
evidence of prestate tribal violence comes from sites in Ukraine, France,
Sweden, Niger, India, and numerous precontact American locations.57
This collection of sites includes the oldest such massacre, the 12,000- to
14,000-year-old Jebel Sahaba site along the Nile in northern Sudan, a
cemetery of fifty-nine men, women, and children, nearly half of whom
have stone projectiles embedded in their bones. And it includes the
largest massacre site, the 700-year-old Crow Creek in South Dakota, a
mass grave of more than four hundred skeletons, with 60 percent
showing evidence of violent deaths. Across the twenty-one sites
surveyed, about 15 percent of skeletons showed evidence of “death in
warfare.” One can, of course, be killed in war in a way that doesn’t leave
fractures or projectiles embedded in bone, suggesting that the percentage
of deaths due to warfare was higher.
