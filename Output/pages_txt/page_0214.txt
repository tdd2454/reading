BOY AND GIRL BRAINS, WHATEVER
THAT MIGHT MEAN
W
e start with a simple version of what “environment” means for a
fetal brain: the nutrients, immune messengers, and, most
important, hormones carried to the brain in the fetal circulation.
Once the pertinent glands have developed in a fetus, they are
perfectly capable of secreting their characteristic hormones. This is
particularly consequential. When hormones first made their entrance in
chapter 4, our discussion concerned their “activational” effects that
lasted on the order of hours to days. In contrast, hormones in the fetus
have “organizational” effects on the brain, causing lifelong changes in
structure and function.
Around eight weeks postconception, human fetal gonads start
secreting their steroid hormones (testosterone in males; estrogen and
progesterone in females). Crucially, testosterone plus “anti-Müllerian
hormone” (also from the testes) masculinize the brain.
Three complications, of increasing messiness:
In many rodents the brain isn’t quite sexually
differentiated at birth, and these hormonal effects
continue postnatally.
A messier complication: Surprisingly few testosterone
effects in the brain result from the hormone binding to
androgen receptors. Instead, testosterone enters targets
cells and, bizarrely, is converted to estrogen, then binds
to intracellular estrogen receptors (while testosterone
has its effects outside the brain either as itself or, after
intracellular conversion to a related androgen,
dihydrotestosterone). Thus testosterone has much of its
masculinizing effect in the brain by becoming estrogen.
The conversion of testosterone to estrogen also occurs in
the fetal brain. Wait. Regardless of fetal sex, fetal
circulation is full of maternal estrogen, plus female
