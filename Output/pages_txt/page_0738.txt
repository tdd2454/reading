care of offspring at the same time as doing the male-male competition thing to enhance their
future reproductive success. Things get complicated here in that the paternalism and the
competition should have opposite effects on testosterone levels. In the one study of this, groin
trumped paternalism—testosterone levels were elevated. P. Onyango et al., “Testosterone
