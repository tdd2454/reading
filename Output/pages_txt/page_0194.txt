develop optimally; if something stressful happens, Mom will handle it
for me.” Accordingly, deprive infant rats of their mothers, and within
hours their adrenals expand and regain the ability to secrete plenty of
glucocorticoids.
During the SHRP infants seem to use a further rule: “If Mom is
around (and I thus don’t secrete glucocorticoids), I should get attached to
any strong stimulus. It couldn’t be bad for me; Mom wouldn’t allow
that.” As evidence, inject glucocorticoids into the amygdalae of young
pups during the conditioning, and the amygdalae would activate and the
pups would develop an aversion to the odor. Conversely, block
glucocorticoid secretion in older pups during conditioning, and they’d
become attracted to the odor. Or condition them with their mother
present, and they wouldn’t secrete glucocorticoids and would develop an
attraction. In other words, in young rats even aversive things are
reinforcing in Mom’s presence, even if Mom is the source of the aversive
stimuli. As Sullivan and colleagues wrote, “attachment [by such an
infant] to the caretaker has evolved to ensure that the infant forms a bond
to that caregiver regardless of the quality of care received.” Any kind of
mother in a storm.
If this applies to humans, it helps explain why individuals abused as
kids are as adults prone toward relationships in which they are abused by
their partner.29 But what about the flip side? Why is it that about 33
percent of adults who were abused as children become abusers
themselves?
Again, useful psychological insights abound, built around
identification with the abuser and rationalizing away the terror: “I love
my kids, but I smack them around when they need it. My father did that
to me, so he could have loved me too.” But once again something
biologically deeper also occurs—infant monkeys abused by their
mothers are more likely to become abusive mothers.30
