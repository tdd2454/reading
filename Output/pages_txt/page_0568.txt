characteristics). In the next part of the study, the temperature of a held
object altered subjects’ generosity and levels of trust—cold hands, cold
heart. And a more activated insula, as shown in a follow-up study.25
Our brains also confuse metaphorical and literal interoceptive
information. Recall that remarkable study showing that in a real-world
situation, a major predictor of whether a prisoner would be granted
parole was how recently the judge had eaten. Empty stomach, harsher
judgment. Other work has shown that when people are hungry, they
become less generous with money and show more future discounting
(i.e., are more likely to want reward X now, rather than wait for reward
2X). Hungering for fame and fortune are just metaphors—yet our brain
pulls circuits related to real hunger into the mix. Moreover, we use more
abstract levels of cognition when thinking about distant events. Ask
people to make a list of the items they’d bring on a camping trip taking
place either tomorrow or in a month; if the former, the list contains more
specific subcategories. In another study subjects were shown a graph of
the average amount of paper used by an office over time. There is a
steady increase until the most recent time period:26
Subjects were then asked to predict what would happen in the next
time period. Half the subjects were told that the office was nearby.
Result: those subjects did a microanalysis, preferentially paying attention
to that final X trending downward, perceiving it to be meaningful, the
start of a pattern:
