transiently strengthened after repeated use. However, if subjects did the
daily exercise for a crazed four weeks, the remapping persisted for many
days afterward. This expansion probably involved axonal sprouting and
the formation of new connections. Remarkably, remapping also occurred
in volunteers who spent two hours a day imagining playing the finger
exercise.
As another example of remapping, after female rats give birth, there
is expansion of the tactile map representing the skin around the nipples.
As a rather different example, spend three months learning how to
juggle, and there is expansion of the cortical map for visual processing of
movement.*17
Thus, experience alters the number and strength of synapses, the
extent of dendritic arbor, and the projection targets of axons. Time for
the biggest revolution in neuroscience in years.
