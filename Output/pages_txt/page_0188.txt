e’ve now gotten a sense of various domains of behavioral
development. Time to frame things with this book’s central
question. Our adult has carried out that wonderful or crummy or
ambiguous behavior. What childhood events contributed to that
occurring?
A first challenge is to truly incorporate biology into our thinking. A
child suffers malnutrition and, as an adult, has poor cognitive skills.
That’s easy to frame biologically—malnutrition impairs brain
development. Alternatively, a child is raised by cold, inexpressive
parents and, as an adult, feels unlovable. It’s harder to link those two
biologically, to resist thinking that somehow this is a less biological
phenomenon than the malnutrition/cognition link. There may be less
known about the biological changes explaining the link between the cold
parents and the adult with poor self-esteem than about the
malnutrition/cognition one. It may be less convenient to articulate the
former biologically than the latter. It may be harder to apply a proximal
biological therapy for the former than for the latter (e.g., an imaginary
neural growth factor drug that improves self-esteem versus cognition).
But biology mediates both links. A cloud may be less tangible than a
brick, but it’s constructed with the same rules about how atoms interact.
How does biology link childhood with the behaviors of adulthood?
Chapter 5’s neural plasticity writ large and early. The developing brain
epitomizes neural plasticity, and every hiccup of experience has an
effect, albeit usually a miniscule one, on that brain.
We now examine ways in which different types of childhoods
produce different sorts of adults.
