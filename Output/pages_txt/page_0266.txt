Centuries to Millennia

L
et’s start with a seeming digression. Parts of chapters 4 and 7 have
debunked some supposed sex differences concerning the brain,
hormones, and behavior. One difference, however, is persistent. It’s far
from issues that concern this book, but bear with me.
A remarkably consistent finding, starting with elementary school
students, is that males are better at math than females. While the
difference is minor when it comes to considering average scores, there is
a huge difference when it comes to math stars at the upper extreme of the
distribution. For example, in 1983, for every girl scoring in the highest
percentile on the math SAT, there were eleven boys.
Why the difference? There have always been suggestions that
testosterone is central. During development, testosterone fuels the
growth of a brain region involved in mathematical thinking, and giving
adults testosterone enhances some math skills. Oh, okay, it’s biological.
But consider a paper published in Science in 2008.1 The authors
examined the relationship between math scores and sexual equality in
forty countries (based on economic, educational, and political indices of
gender equality; the worst was Turkey, the United States was middling,
and, naturally, the Scandinavians were tops). Lo and behold, the more
gender equal the country, the less of a discrepancy in math scores. By the
time you get to the Scandinavian countries, it’s statistically insignificant.
And by the time you examine the most gender-equal country on earth at
the time, Iceland, girls are better at math than boys.*
