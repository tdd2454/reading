declared that morning, that American defenses would be ready. He soon
learned that instead it was a sneak attack.
Some larger factors favored his gesture as well. Japanese/American
relations had transformed. And Americans were not traditional enemies.
The racial, cultural, and geographic distance might have facilitated
pseudospeciation of Americans, but it was nouveau pseudospeciation,
contrasting with centuries of hatred of a nearby enemy—Abe never went
to China to apologize for the Rape of Nanking. As we know, Thems
come in different categories.
So these likelihoods and unlikelihoods converged, and Abe stood
there, along with nine other pilots who had flown that day, apologizing.
Some survivors refused the overture. Most accepted it. Abe and other
pilots made subsequent trips to Pearl Harbor and had multiday meetings
with American survivors; reconciliative handshakes were broadcast on
the Today show for the fiftieth anniversary. Survivors generally
considered the pilots to have just been following orders and found their
current actions brave and admirable. Abe became close with one
survivor, Richard Fiske, a docent at the memorial. Fiske had been on one
of the ships during the attack, lost many friends among the 2,390
Americans killed, fought at Iwo Jima, described himself as so hating the
Japanese that he developed a bleeding ulcer. For reasons he never fully
understood, Fiske was the first to accept Abe’s gesture. Other Japanese
and Americans became close as well, visiting the homes and, eventually,
the grave sites of their ex-enemies.
