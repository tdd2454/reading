* I’ve observed a remarkable example of this among the baboons that I’ve studied in East Africa. Over the thirty-odd years
I’ve watched them, I’ve seen a handful of instances of what I believe warrants the seemingly human-specific term “rape”—
where a male baboon will forcibly vaginally penetrate a female who is not in estrus, who is not sexually receptive, who
struggles to prevent it, and who gives every indication of distress and pain when it happens. And each of these instances has
been the act of the former alpha male in the hours after he has been toppled from his position.
