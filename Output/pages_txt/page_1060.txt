* Poor Wynne-Edwards was actually a major figure in evolution and behavior but, thanks to shallow and superficial people,
he is remembered only for having blown it with group selection. I, for example, haven’t a clue what else the guy ever did. His
full name was Vero Copner Wynne-Edwards, which probably explains why he’s always called “V. C. Wynne-Edwards,” no
doubt even as an infant.
