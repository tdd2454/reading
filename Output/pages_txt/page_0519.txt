We’ve seen something equivalent with the brave act, the person who,
amid the paralyzed crowd, runs into the burning building to save the
child. “What were you thinking when you decided to go into the house”?
(Were you thinking about the evolution of cooperation, of reciprocal
altruism, of game theory and reputation?) And the answer is always “I
wasn’t thinking anything. Before I knew it, I had run in.” Interviews of
Carnegie Medal recipients about that moment shows precisely that—a
first, intuitive thought of needing to help, resulting in the risking of life
without a second thought. “Heroism feels and never reasons,” to quote
Emerson.46
It’s the same thing here: “Why did you never cheat? Is it because of
your ability to see the long-term consequences of cheating becoming
normalized, or your respect for the Golden Rule, or . . . ?” The answer is
“I don’t know [shrug]. I just don’t cheat.” This isn’t a deontological or a
consequentialist moment. It’s virtue ethics sneaking in the back door in
that moment—“I don’t cheat; that’s not who I am.” Doing the right thing
is the easier thing.
