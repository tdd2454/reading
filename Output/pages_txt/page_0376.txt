hunter version of hunter-gatherers viewed this as arising from
patrilocality (i.e., where a woman, when marrying, moves to live with
the group of her new husband), while the groovy-hunter-gatherers
version tied it to matrilocality (i.e., the opposite). However, a study of
more than five thousand people from thirty-two hunter-gatherer societies
from around the world* showed that only around 40 percent of people
within bands are blood relatives.63 In other words, hunter-gatherer
cooperativeness, the social building block of 99 percent of hominin
history, rests at least as much on reciprocal altruism among nonrelatives
as on kin selection (with chapter 9’s caveat that this assumes that
contemporary hunter-gatherers are good stand-ins for ancestral ones).
So humans excel at cooperation among nonrelatives. We’ve already
considered circumstances that favor reciprocal altruism; this will be
returned to in the final chapter. Moreover, it’s not just groups of nice
chickens outcompeting groups of mean ones that has revivified group
selectionism. It is at the core of cooperation and competition among
human groups and cultures.
Thus humans deviate from the strict predictions concerning the
evolution of behavior. And this is pertinent when considering three major
criticisms of sociobiology.
