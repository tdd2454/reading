And out of this comes a rule: the more neurons that neuron A projects to,
by definition, the more neurons it can influence; however, the more
neurons it projects to, the smaller its average influence will be at each of
those target neurons. There’s a trade-off.
This doesn’t matter in the spinal cord, where one neuron typically
sends all its projections to the next one in line. But in the brain one
neuron will disperse its projections to scads of other ones and receive
inputs from scads of other ones, with each neuron’s axon hillock
determining whether the threshold is reached and an action potential
