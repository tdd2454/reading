hat happens when everything goes wrong—no mother or family,
minimal peer interactions, sensory and cognitive neglect, plus
some malnutrition?46
These are the Romanian
institution kids, poster children for
just how nightmarish childhood can
be. In the 1980s the Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu banned
contraceptives and abortions and
required women to bear at least five
children. Soon institutions filled
with thousands of infants and kids
abandoned by impoverished
families (many intent on reclaiming
their child when finances
improved).* Kids were warehoused
in overwhelmed institutions,
resulting in severe neglect and
deprivation. The story broke after
Ceauşescu’s 1989 overthrow. Many kids were adopted by Westerners,
and international attention led to some improvements in the institutions.
Since then, children adopted in the West, those eventually returned to
their families, and those who remained institutionalized have been
studied, primarily by Charles Nelson of Harvard.
As adults, these kids are mostly what you’d expect. Low IQ and poor
cognitive skills. Problems with forming attachments, often bordering on
autistic. Anxiety and depression galore. The longer the
institutionalization, the worse the prognosis.
And their brains? Decreased total brain size, gray matter, white
matter, frontal cortical metabolism, connectivity between regions, sizes
of individual brain regions. Except for the amygdala. Which is enlarged.
That pretty much says it all.
