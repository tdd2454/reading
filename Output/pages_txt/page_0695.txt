nuts and bolts of neurotransmitterology can be changed by experience as
well.
MORE THAN TWO NEURONS AT A TIME
W
e have now triumphantly reached the point of thinking about
three neurons at a time. And within not too many pages, we will
have gone wild and considered even more than three. The purpose of this
section is to see how circuits of neurons work, the intermediate step
before examining what entire regions of the brain have to do with the
best and worst of our behaviors. Therefore, the examples here were
chosen merely to give a flavor of how things work at this level.
Neuromodulation
Consider the following diagram:
The axon terminal of neuron B forms a synapse with the dendritic
spine of the postsynaptic neuron (let’s call it neuron C) and releases an
excitatory neurotransmitter. The usual. Meanwhile, neuron A sends an
