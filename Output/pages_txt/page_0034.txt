world of speech through emotive, limbic detours—they can sing what
they want to say. The cortex and limbic system are not separate, as scads
of axonal projections course between the two. Crucially, those
projections are bidirectional—the limbic system talks to the cortex,
rather than merely being reined in by it. The false dichotomy between
thought and feeling is presented in the classic Descartes’ Error, by the
neurologist Antonio Damasio of the University of Southern California;
his work is discussed later.2
While the hypothalamus dwells at the interface of layers 1 and 2, it is
the incredibly interesting frontal cortex that is the interface between
layers 2 and 3.
Key insight into the frontal cortex was provided in the 1960s by a
giant of neuroscience, Walle Nauta of MIT.*3 Nauta studied what brain
regions sent axons to the frontal cortex and what regions got axons from
it. And the frontal cortex was bidirectionally enmeshed with the limbic
system, leading him to propose that the frontal cortex is a quasi member
of the limbic system. Naturally, everyone thought him daft. The frontal
cortex was the most recently evolved part of the very highbrow cortex—
the only reason why the frontal cortex would ever go slumming into the
limbic system would be to preach honest labor and Christian temperance
to the urchins there.
Naturally, Nauta was right. In different circumstances the frontal
cortex and limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other, collaborate and
coordinate, or bicker and work at cross-purposes. It really is an honorary
member of the limbic system. And the interactions between the frontal
cortex and (other) limbic structures are at the core of much of this book.
Two more details. First, the cortex is not a smooth surface but instead
is folded into convolutions. The convolutions form a superstructure of
four separate lobes: the temporal, parietal, occipital, and frontal, each
with different functions.
