* Unconscious cues aren’t always about faces and posture. Among closely matched teams or individual male athletic
competitors, wearing a red jersey boosts performance. This has been shown in Olympic boxing, tae kwon do, and wrestling,
for rugby and soccer teams, and when playing a virtual gladitorial computer game. It has been speculated to reflect the fact
that in many species (e.g., mandrill monkeys and widow birds) male dominance displays involve flashing a red body part,
where more testosterone equals more intense red. I’m dubious about the explanation, as it feels like cherry-picking examples
from other species.
