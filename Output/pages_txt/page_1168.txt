* The amygdaloid involvement is probably pertinent to a case report from some French neurologists concerning a man who
had a seizure every time he lied during business negotiations. He was found to have a tumor pressing on his amygdala; once
it was removed, the seizures went away (there was no mention of whether the guy was still lying at work). The authors called
this “Pinocchio syndrome.”
