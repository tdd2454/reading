In the mid-1980s the baboon troop adjacent to my study group hit the
jackpot. Their territory included a tourist lodge; as at tourist places
anywhere in the wilds, it had always been a challenge keeping wildlife
from feeding on food garbage. Hidden in a grove of trees far from the
lodge was a deep garbage pit, surrounded by a fence. But baboons climb
fences, fences get knocked down, gates are left open—and that
neighboring troop had taken to foraging daily in the dump. Like another
widely dispersed primate, humans, baboons eat almost anything—fruit,
plants, tubers, insects, eggs, prey they’ve killed, dead things they’ve
scavenged.

This transformed the “Garbage
Dump” troop. Baboons normally
descend from their sleeping trees at
dawn and walk ten miles a day
foraging. Garbage Dumpers slept in
trees above the dump, waddled
down at eight o’clock to meet the
garbage tractor from the lodge, spend ten minutes in frenzied
competition for discarded roast beef and drumsticks and plum pudding,
and then waddle out for a nap. I’d even darted Garbage Dump animals
and studied them with colleagues—they put on weight, thickened with
subcutaneous fat, had elevated circulating levels of insulin and
triglycerides, had the start of metabolic syndrome.46
