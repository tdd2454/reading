* Here’s an example of how things, naturally, are more complicated than this simple matrix. Insofar as we view low-
warmth/low-competence individuals as dehumanized objects, we objectify them. But “objectify” more frequently denotes
sexualization of women. In one study men with high degrees of hostile sexism showed less activation of the medial PFC
(along with other brain regions associated with Theory of Mind and perspective taking) when looking at pictures of women.
But only if the pictures were particularly sexualized. And there was a world of difference between how a hostilely sexist male
viewed a sexually provocative picture of a woman versus a picture of a homeless person. In the words of the authors, the
study shows that “diminished mental state attribution is not unique to targets that people prefer to avoid.”
