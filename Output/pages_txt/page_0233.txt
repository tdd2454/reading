combination of exons. Oh, and splicing enzymes are proteins, meaning
that each is coded for by a gene. Loops and loops.
Transposable Genetic Elements, the Stability of the
Genome, and Neurogenesis
Time to unmoor another cherished idea, namely that genes inherited
from your parents (i.e., what you started with as a fertilized egg) are
immutable. This calls up a great chapter of science history. In the 1940s
an accomplished plant geneticist named Barbara McClintock observed
something impossible. She was studying the inheritance of kernel color
in maize (a frequent tool of geneticists) and found patterns of mutations
unexplained by any known mechanism. The only possibility, she
concluded, was that stretches of DNA had been copied, with the copy
then randomly inserted into another stretch of DNA.
Yeah, right.
Clearly McClintock, with her (derisively named) “jumping genes,”
had gone mad, and so she was ignored (not exactly true, but this detracts
from the drama). She soldiered on in epic isolation. And finally, with the
molecular revolution of the 1970s, she was vindicated about her (now
termed) transposable genetic elements, or transposons. She was lionized,
canonized, Nobel Prized (and was wonderfully inspirational, as
disinterested in acclaim as in her ostracism, working until her nineties).
Transpositional events rarely produce great outcomes. Consider a
hypothetical stretch of DNA coding for “The fertilized egg is implanted
in the uterus.”
There has been a transpositional event, where the underlined stretch
of message was copied and randomly plunked down elsewhere: “The
fertilized eggterus is implanted in the uterus.”
Gibberish.
But sometimes “The fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus”
becomes “The fertilized eggplant is implanted in the uterus.”
Now, that’s not an everyday occurrence.

Plants utilize transposons. Suppose there is a drought; plants can’t move
to wetter pastures like animals can. Plant “stress” such as drought
