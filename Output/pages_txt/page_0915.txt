* Discriminating online shoppers can now buy “Liquid Trust,” touted as “the world’s first oxytocin pheromone product.”
Perhaps worse, perfectly straitlaced scientific publications have referred to oxytocin as the “love drug” or the “cuddle drug.”
The “cuddle” part is puzzling, since the literature is about oxytocin-laden prairie voles huddling, not cuddling, and the former
doesn’t evoke images of luv-fests as much as of tubercular huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
