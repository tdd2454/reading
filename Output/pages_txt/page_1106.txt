* Interestingly, research has shown a similar pattern with conspiracy theorists. People who believe that aliens landed in New
Mexico way back when have a higher-than-chance likelihood of also believing that Princess Di was murdered at the behest of
the other royals. And just to show how irrational this all is, as long as you don’t ask them about both scenarios too close in
time to each other, people who believe that Di was murdered . . . also . . . believe at a higher-than-chance level that she faked
her own death and is, say, living under an assumed name in Wisconsin.
