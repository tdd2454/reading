Twelve
Hierarchy, Obedience, and
Resistance
A
t first glance, this chapter simply complements the previous one.
Us/Them-ing is about relations between groups and our
automatic tendency to favor in-groups over out-groups. Similarly,
hierarchies are about a type of relations within groups, our automatic
tendency to favor people close in rank to us over those who are distant.
Other themes repeat as well—the appearance of these tendencies early in
life and in other species, and the intertwined cognitive and affective
underpinnings.
Moreover, Us/Them categorization and hierarchical position interact.
In one study subjects gave racial designations to pictures of racially
ambiguous individuals; those dressed in low-status attire were more
likely to be categorized as black, high-status attire, white.1 Thus, among
these American subjects, Us/Them dichotomizing by race and the
hierarchy of socioeconomic status overlap.
But as we’ll see, hierarchy heads in different directions from
Us/Them-ing, and in uniquely human ways: Like other hierarchical
species, we have alpha individuals, but unlike most others, we
occasionally get to choose them. Moreover, they often are not merely
highest ranking but also “lead,” attempting to maximize this thing called
the common good. Furthermore, individuals vie for leadership with
differing visions of how best to attain that common good—political
ideologies. And finally, we express obedience both to an authority and to
the idea of Authority.
