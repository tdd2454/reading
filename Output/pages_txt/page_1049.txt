* I was in San Francisco for the quake, and much was made of the fact that fancy downtown hotels opened their doors to
house people needing shelter. It’s worth noting that this generosity was for people made homeless by the quake, not people
who were already homeless. For them the earthquake was just another day of scrabbling. The hotels supposedly required a
credit card from people, not because they’d be charged for the room, but as evidence that this was the sort of person whose
homelessness mattered. This well could have been apocryphal; it’s hard to imagine that the staff at reception needed to see
someone’s plastic to tell the difference.
