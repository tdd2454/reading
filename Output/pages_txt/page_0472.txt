Finally, responsibility is diffused by anonymity.78 This comes de
facto if the group is large enough, and large groups also facilitate
individual efforts at anonymity—during the Chicago riots of 1968, many
police notoriously covered their name tags before setting on the unarmed
antiwar demonstrators. Groups also facilitate conformity by
institutionalizing anonymity; examples range from the KKK to Star
Wars’ Imperial Storm Troopers to the finding that in traditional human
societies, warriors who transform and standardize their appearance
before battle are more likely to torture and mutilate their enemies than
warriors from cultures that don’t transform themselves. All use means to
deindividuate, where the goal may not be to ensure that a victimized
Them won’t be able to recognize you afterward as much as to facilitate
moral disengagement so that you won’t be able to recognize you
afterward.
