Militaries train soldiers to override their inhibitions against killing,
and Grossman notes that the training has become more effective—
trainees no longer fire at bull’s-eyes; instead it’s rapid-fire situations of
mobile virtual-reality figures coming at you, where shooting becomes
reflexive. In the Korean War, 55 percent of American riflemen fired their
weapons; in the Vietnam War, over 90 percent. And this was before the
rise of violent, desensitizing video games.
Maybe there will soon be completely different types of wars. Perhaps
drones themselves will decide when to fire. Maybe wars will consist of
autonomous weapons fighting each other, or each side racing to win with
the most effective cyberattack on the other’s computers. But as long as
we still see the faces of those we kill, this seemingly natural inhibition
will be vital.
