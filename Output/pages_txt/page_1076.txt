* This doesn’t begin to scratch the surface of the weirdness of the naked mole rat. They live underground, have giant incisors
and no body hair so that they look like saber-toothed sausages, have remarkably little need for oxygen, have next to no pain
receptors in their skin, live about ten times longer than other rodents (up to around thirty years), and are remarkably resistant
to cancer. For this reason the prestigious science journal Nature named the naked mole rat its Vertebrate of the Year a few
years ago, which is much cooler and more impressive than making People magazine’s list of the Fifty Most Beautiful People
in the World.
