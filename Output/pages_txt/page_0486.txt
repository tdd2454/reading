Capuchin monkeys were trained in a task: A human gives them a mildly
interesting small object—a pebble. The human then extends her hand
palm up, a capuchin begging gesture. If the monkey puts the pebble in
her hand, there’s a food reward. In other words, the animals learned how
to buy food.
Now there are two capuchins, side by side. Each gets a pebble. Each
gives it to the human. Each gets a grape, very rewarding.
Now change things. Both monkeys pay their pebble. Monkey 1 gets a
grape. But monkey 2 gets some cucumber, which blows compared with
grapes—capuchins prefer grapes to cucumber 90 percent of the time.
Monkey 2 was shortchanged.
And monkey 2 would then typically fling the cucumber at the human
or bash around in frustration. Most consistently, they wouldn’t give the
pebble the next time. As the Nature paper was entitled, “Monkeys reject
unequal pay.”
This response has since been demonstrated in various macaque
monkey species, crows, ravens, and dogs (where the dog’s “work” would
be shaking her paw).*13
Subsequent work by Brosnan, de Waal, and others fleshed out this
phenomenon further:14
One criticism of the original study was that maybe
capuchins refused to work for cucumbers because
grapes were visible, regardless of whether the other guy
was getting paid in grapes. But no—the phenomenon
required unfair payment.
Both animals are getting grapes, then one gets switched
to cucumber. What’s key—that the other guy is still
getting grapes, or that I no longer am? The former—if
doing the study with a single monkey, switching from
grapes to cucumbers would not evoke refusal. Nor
would it if both monkeys got cucumbers.
Across the various species, males were more likely than
females to reject “lower pay”; dominant animals were
more likely than subordinates to reject.
It’s about the work—give one monkey a free grape, the
other free cucumber, and the latter doesn’t get pissed.
