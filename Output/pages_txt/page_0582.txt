ome years back a foundation sent a letter to various people,
soliciting Big Ideas for a funding initiative of theirs. The letter said
something along the lines of “Send us a provocative idea, something
you’d never propose to another foundation because they’d label you
crazy.”
That sounded fun. So I sent them a proposal titled “Should the
Criminal Justice System Be Abolished?” I argued that the answer was
yes, that neuroscience shows the system makes no sense and they should
fund an initiative to accomplish that.
“Ha-ha,” they said. “Well, we asked for it. That certainly caught our
attention. That’s a great idea to focus on interactions between
neuroscience and the law. Let’s do a conference.”
So I went to a conference with some neuroscientists and some legal
types—law professors, judges, and criminologists. We learned one
another’s terminology, for example seeing how we neuroscientists and
the legal people use “possible,” “probable,” and “certainty” differently.
We discovered that most of the neuroscientists, including me, knew
nothing about the workings of the legal world, and that most of the legal
folks had avoided science since being traumatized by ninth-grade
biology. Despite the two-culture problem, all sorts of collaborations got
