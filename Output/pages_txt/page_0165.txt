facial expressions. In other words, kids who are more sensitive to peer
pressure are more prepared to imitate someone else’s emotionality.
(Given the age of the subjects, the authors framed their findings as
potentially predictive of later teen behavior.)*
This atomistic level of explaining conformity might predict
something about which teens are likely to join in a riot. But it doesn’t tell
much about who chooses not to invite someone to a party because the
cool kids think she’s a loser.
Another study showed neurobiological correlates of more abstract
peer conformity. Recall how the adolescent ventral striatum helps the
frontal cortex reappraise social exclusion. In this study, young
adolescents most resistant to peer influence had the strongest such
ventral striatal responses. And where might a stronger ventral striatum
come from? You know the answer by now: you’ll see in the remaining
chapters.
