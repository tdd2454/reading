AND US
W
here do humans fit into all this? Our behavior closely matches
the predictions of these evolutionary models. Until you look
more closely.48
Let’s start by clearing up some misconceptions. First, we are not
descended from chimps. Or from any extant animal. We and chimps
share a common ancestor from roughly five million years ago (and
genomics show that chimps have been as busy evolving since then as we
have).49
And there are misconceptions as to which ape is our “closest
relative.” In my experience, someone who is fond of duck hunting and
country music usually votes chimp, but if you eat organic food and know
about oxytocin, it’s bonobo. The reality is that we’re equally related to
both, sharing roughly 98 to 99 percent of our DNA with each. Svante
Pääbo of the Max Planck Institutes in Germany has shown that 1.6
percent of the human genome is more related to bonobos than to chimps;
1.7 percent more to chimps than to bonobos.*50 Despite the combination
of some of our most fervent wishes and excuses, we’re neither bonobos
nor chimps.
On to how the conceptual building blocks of behavioral evolution
apply to humans.
Promiscuous Tournament or Monogamous Pair-
Bonded?
I can’t resist starting with an irresistible question—so, are we a pair-
bonded or tournament species?51
Western civilization doesn’t give a clear answer. We praise stable,
devoted relationships yet are titillated, tempted, and succumb to
alternatives at a high rate. Once divorces are legalized, a large percentage
of marriages end in them, yet a smaller percentage of married people get
divorced—i.e., the high divorce rate arises from serial divorcers.
