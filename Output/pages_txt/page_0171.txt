A FINAL THOUGHT: WHY CAN’T THE
FRONTAL CORTEX JUST ACT ITS AGE?
A
s promised, this chapter’s dominant fact has been the delayed
maturation of the frontal cortex. Why should the delay occur? Is it
because the frontal cortex is the brain’s most complicated construction
project?
Probably not. The frontal cortex uses the same neurotransmitter
systems as the rest of the brain and uses the same basic neurons.
Neuronal density and complexity of interconnections are similar to the
rest of the (fancy) cortex. It isn’t markedly harder to build frontal cortex
than any other cortical region.
Thus, it is not likely that if the brain “could” grow a frontal cortex as
fast as the rest of the cortex, it “would.” Instead I think there was
evolutionary selection for delayed frontal cortex maturation.
If the frontal cortex matured as fast as the rest of the brain, there’d be
none of the adolescent turbulence, none of the antsy, itchy exploration
and creativity, none of the long line of pimply adolescent geniuses who
dropped out of school and worked away in their garages to invent fire,
cave painting, and the wheel.
Maybe. But this just-so story must accommodate behavior evolving
to pass on copies of the genes of individuals, not for the good of the
species (stay tuned for chapter 10). And for every individual who scored
big time reproductively thanks to adolescent inventiveness, there’ve been
far more who instead broke their necks from adolescent imprudence. I
don’t think delayed frontal cortical maturation evolved so that
adolescents could act over the top.
Instead, I think it is delayed so that the brain gets it right. Well, duh;
the brain needs to “get it right” with all its parts. But in a distinctive way
in the frontal cortex. The point of the previous chapter was the brain’s
plasticity—new synapses form, new neurons are born, circuits rewire,
brain regions expand or contract—we learn, change, adapt. This is
nowhere more important than in the frontal cortex.
