In the Spanish Civil War, Republican and Fascist troops regularly
met at night to drink, barter, and exchange newspapers, everyone on the
lookout for officers. In the Crimean War there was regular bartering
across enemy lines of Russian vodka for French baguettes. One British
soldier in the Peninsular War described how in the evenings, British and
French troops played cards around campfires. And in the American Civil
War, Yankee and Rebel soldiers would fraternize, barter, trade
newspapers, and, with piercing poignancy, hold joint baptismal services
the evening before a battle that would clearly be a bloodbath.
Thus enemy soldiers have frequently found common ground. A little
over a hundred years ago, two such events occurred on a stunning scale.
It must be admitted that some good came of World War I—thanks to
the subsequent collapse of three empires, people in the Baltic, the
Balkans, and Eastern Europe gained independence. But from anyone
else’s perspective, it was a pointless slaughter of fifteen million people.
The war to end all wars, leading to the ruinous peace to end all peace,
turned out to be just another of centuries of examples of Europe
devouring its young with meaningless conflict. But amid the quagmire of
World War I came two examples of hope that, for want of a better word,
seem almost miraculous.
