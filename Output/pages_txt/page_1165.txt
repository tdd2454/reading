* Just to reiterate, starting with those social yeast, deception is not limited to primates. Deception along similar lines to that
observed in capuchins has been reported in those brilliant corvid birds; moreover, behaviors such as plover birds feigning
injury to lure a predator away from its nest have been interpreted as tactical deception. (“Don’t eat the babies. Look, come
after me! I’ve got more meat and I can’t get away because I’m injured.”) Similar deception has also been reported in other
birds, some ungulates, and cuttlefish.
