An oft-repeated fact about adolescents is how “emotional
intelligence” and “social intelligence” predict adult success and
happiness better than do IQ or SAT scores.33 It’s all about social
memory, emotional perspective taking, impulse control, empathy, ability
to work with others, self-regulation. There is a parallel in other primates,
with their big, slowly maturing frontal cortices. For example, what
makes for a “successful” male baboon in his dominance hierarchy?
Attaining high rank is about muscle, sharp canines, well-timed
aggression. But once high status is achieved, maintaining it is all about
social smarts—knowing which coalitions to form, how to intimidate a
rival, having sufficient impulse control to ignore most provocations and
to keep displacement aggression to a reasonable level. Similarly, as noted
in chapter 2, among male rhesus monkeys a large prefrontal cortex goes
hand in hand with social dominance.
Adult life is filled with consequential forks in the road where the
right thing is definitely harder. Navigating these successfully is the
portfolio of the frontal cortex, and developing the ability to do this right
in each context requires profound shaping by experience.
This may be the answer. As we will see in chapter 8, the brain is
heavily influenced by genes. But from birth through young adulthood,
the part of the human brain that most defines us is less a product of the
genes with which you started life than of what life has thrown at you.
Because it is the last to mature, by definition the frontal cortex is the
brain region least constrained by genes and most sculpted by experience.
This must be so, to be the supremely complex social species that we are.
Ironically, it seems that the genetic program of human brain development
has evolved to, as much as possible, free the frontal cortex from genes.
