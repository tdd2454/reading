* Antisocial behavior in the name of kin selection reaches its apogee in the animal kingdom, as far as I’m concerned, with a
phenomenon reported in a 2008 article in the Wall Street Journal. What restaurant/fast-food chain has the highest rate of
fights among clientele, nationwide? Yup, you guessed it—Chuck E. Cheese’s, where the fighting is among parents on edge
about anything that would detract from the perfection of their child’s birthday party. A particularly common scenario might
be where a parent takes exception to some kid hogging a video game and forcefully intervenes to allow their own child to
play, leading to an altercation between the parents—Cheney and Seyfarth’s monkeys would have no trouble following that
one. As reported in another journalistic exposé, such incidents can also involve attacks on the Chuck E. Cheese’s mascot,
including a case of a father accusing Chuck of having pinned his boy against a wall, while the mouse said he was just trying
to squeeze by a crowd of overexcited kids: “The man ripped the mouse’s head off and yelled at him in front of said rowdy
children, who probably were forever traumatized by the sight of the frightened 19-year-old kid’s head sticking out of the giant
mouse’s neck.”
