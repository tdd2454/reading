* For example, the phenomenon where experience can turn the on/off switch on a gene in a particular direction used to be
considered permanent; that is turning out not to be the case. Similarly, the hippocampal atrophy in Cushing’s syndrome
appears to reverse within a year or so after the tumor is removed. As one disturbing exception to this theme, most studies
suggest that the atrophy of the hippocampus with long-term major depression persists after the depression is successfully
treated. Moreover, the reversibility of some of these effects (for example, of stress-induced retraction of dendritic processes)
decreases with age.
