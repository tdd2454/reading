MR. SPOCK AND JOSEPH STALIN
M
any moral philosophers believe not only that moral judgment is
built on reasoning but also that it should be. This is obvious to
fans of Mr. Spock, since the emotional component of moral intuitionism
just introduces sentimentality, self-interest, and parochial biases. But one
remarkable finding counters this.
Relatives are special. Chapter 10 attests to that. Any social organism
would tell you so. Joseph Stalin thought so concerning Pavlik Morozov
ratting out his father. As do most American courts, where there is either
de facto or de jure resistance to making someone testify against their
own parent or child. Relatives are special. But not to people lacking
social intuitionism. As noted, people with vmPFC damage make
extraordinarily practical, unemotional moral decisions. And in the
process they do something that everyone, from clonal yeast to Uncle Joe
to the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence considers morally suspect: they
advocate harming kin as readily as strangers in an “Is it okay to sacrifice
one person to save five?” scenario.18
Emotion and social intuition are not some primordial ooze that gums
up that human specialty of moral reasoning. Instead, they anchor some of
the few moral judgments that most humans agree upon.
