motivating reconciliation. This is shown in another, realpolitik way—
kids reconcile more readily when the relationship matters to them.
Level 2: Should I Eat the Cookie? Conventional
Reasoning
Stage 3. It depends. Who will be deprived if I do? Do I like them?
What would other people do? What will people think of me for eating
the cookie? It’s nice to think of others; it’s good to be well regarded.
Stage 4. It depends. What’s the law? Are laws sacrosanct? What if
everyone broke this law? It’s nice to have order. This is the judge who,
considering predatory but legal lending practices by a bank, thinks, “I
feel sorry for these victims . . . but I’m here to decide whether the bank
broke a law . . . and it didn’t.”
Conventional moral reasoning is relational (about your interactions
with others and their consequences); most adolescents and adults are at
this level.
Level 3: Should I Eat the Cookie?
Postconventional Reasoning
Stage 5: It depends. What circumstances placed the cookie there?
Who decided that I shouldn’t take it? Would I save a life by taking the
cookie? It’s nice when clear rules are applied flexibly. Now the judge
would think: “Yes, the bank’s actions were legal, but ultimately laws
exist to protect the weak from the mighty, so signed contract or
otherwise, that bank must be stopped.”
Stage 6: It depends. Is my moral stance regarding this more vital than
some law, a stance for which I’d pay the ultimate price if need be? It’s
nice to know there are things for which I’d repeatedly sing, “We Will
Not Be Moved.”
This level is egoistic in that rules and their application come from
within and reflect conscience, where a transgression exacts the ultimate
cost—having to live with yourself afterward. It recognizes that being
good and being law-abiding aren’t synonymous. As Woody Guthrie
wrote in “Pretty Boy Floyd,” “I love a good man outside the law, just as
much as I hate a bad man inside the law.”*
