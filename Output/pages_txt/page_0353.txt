Example 8:
You: C C C C C
Her: C C C C D
You think, “What a creep, defecting like that.” You defect in the next
round. Thus, what you think has happened:
Example 9:
You: C C C C C D
Her: C C C C D C
What she thinks is happening, being unaware of the signal error:
Example 10:
You: C C C C C D
Her: C C C C C C
She thinks, “What a creep, defecting like that.” Thus she defects the
next round. “Oh, so you want more? I’ll give you more,” you think, and
defect. “Oh, so you want more? I’ll give you more,” she thinks:
Example 11:
You: C C C C C D C D C D C D C D C D. . . .
Her: C C C C D C D C D C D C D C D C. . . .
When signal errors are possible, a pair of Tit for Tat players are
vulnerable to being locked forever in this seesawing of defection.*
The discovery of this vulnerability prompted evolutionary biologists
Martin Nowak of Harvard, Karl Sigmund of the University of Vienna,
and Robert Boyd of UCLA to provide two solutions.35 “Contrite Tit for
Tat” retaliates only if the other side has defected twice in a row.
“Forgiving Tit for Tat” automatically forgives one third of defections.
Both avoid doomsday signal-error scenarios but are vulnerable to
exploitation.*
A solution to this vulnerability is to shift the frequency of
forgiveness in accordance with the likelihood of signal error (“Sorry I’m
