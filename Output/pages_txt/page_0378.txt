THE NEXT CHALLENGE: IS
EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE
CONTINUOUS AND GRADUAL?
T
he term “evolution” carries context-dependent baggage. If you’re in
the Bible Belt, evolution is leftist besmirching of God, morality,
and human exceptionalism. But to extreme leftists, “evolution” is a
reactionary term, the slow change that impedes real change—“All reform
undermines revolution.” This next challenge addresses whether evolution
is actually more about rapid revolution than about slow reform.
A basic sociobiological premise is that evolutionary change is
gradual, incremental. As a selective pressure gradually changes, a useful
gene variant grows more common in a population’s gene pool. As
enough changes accrue, the population may even constitute a new
species (“phyletic gradualism”). Over millions of years, dinosaurs
gradually turn into chickens, organisms emerge that qualify as mammals
as glandular secretions slowly evolve into milk, thumbs increasingly
oppose in proto-primates. Evolution is gradual, continuous.
In 1972 Stephen Jay Gould and paleontologist Niles Eldredge of the
American Museum of Natural History proposed an idea that simmered
and then caught fire in the 1980s. They argued that evolution isn’t
gradual; instead, most of the time nothing happens, and evolution occurs
in intermittent rapid, dramatic lurches.64
Punctuated Equilibrium
Their idea, which they called punctuated equilibrium, was anchored
in paleontology. Fossil records, we all know, show gradualism—human
ancestors show progressively larger skulls, more upright posture, and so
on. And if two fossils in chronological progression differ a lot, a jump in
the gradualism, there must be an intermediate form that is the “missing
link” from a time between those two fossils. With enough fossils in a
lineage, things will look gradualist.
