* Thanks to the wisdom of Dale, we know that the same neurotransmitter(s) is coming out of every axon terminal of neuron
C. In other words, the same neurotransmitter can be excitatory at some synapses and inhibitory at others. This is determined
by what type of ion channel the receptor is coupled to in the dendritic spine.
