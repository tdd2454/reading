THE AMYGDALA
T
he amygdala* is the archetypal limbic structure, sitting under the
cortex in the temporal lobe. It is central to mediating aggression,
along with other behaviors that tell us tons about aggression.
A First Pass at the Amygdala and Aggression
The evidence for the amygdala’s role in aggression is extensive,
based on research approaches that will become familiar.
First there’s the correlative “recording” approach. Stick recording
electrodes into numerous species’ amygdalae* and see when neurons
there have action potentials; this turns out to be when the animal is being
aggressive.* In a related approach, determine which brain regions
consume extra oxygen or glucose, or synthesize certain activity-related
proteins, during aggression—the amygdala tops the list.
Moving beyond mere correlation, if you lesion the amygdala in an
animal, rates of aggression decline. The same occurs transiently when
you temporarily silence the amygdala by injecting Novocain into it.
Conversely, implanting electrodes that stimulate neurons there, or
spritzing in excitatory neurotransmitters (stay tuned), triggers
aggression.4
Show human subjects pictures that provoke anger, and the amygdala
activates (as shown with neuroimaging). Sticking an electrode in
someone’s amygdala and stimulating it (as is done before certain types of
neurosurgery) produces rage.
The most convincing data concern rare humans with damage
restricted to the amygdala, either due to a type of encephalitis or a
congenital disorder called Urbach-Wiethe disease, or where the
amygdala was surgically destroyed to control severe, drug-resistant
seizures originating there.5 Such individuals are impaired in detecting
angry facial expressions (while being fine at recognizing other emotional
states—stay tuned).
