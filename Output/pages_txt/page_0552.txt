Metaphors We Kill By

Sinai, various branches of Abrahamic religions have had a thing

grounds. Orthodox Judaism has been into that at times; ditto for
Calvinists, especially when it came to those idolatrous Catholics.
Currently it’s branches of Sunni Islam that deploy literal graven-image
police and consider the height of offense to be images of Allah and
Muhammad.
In September 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published
cartoon images of Muhammad on its editorial page. It was a protest
against Danish censorship and self-censorship about the subject, against
Islam being a sacred cow in a Western democracy where other religions
are readily criticized satirically. None of the cartoons suggested
reverence or respect. Many explicitly linked Muhammad with terrorism
(e.g., him wearing a bomb as a turban). Many were ironic about the ban
—Muhammad as a stick figure with a turban, Muhammad (armed with a
sword) with a blackened rectangle over his eyes, Muhammad in a police

And as a direct result of the cartoons, Western embassies and
consulates were attacked, even burned, in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and

Pakistan, Somalia, and Turkey (typically either by mob stampedes or by
