The thing that makes the
tragedy of commonsense morality
so tragic is the intensity with which
you just know that They are deeply
wrong.
In general, our morally tinged
cultural institutions—religion,
nationalism, ethnic pride, team
spirit—bias us toward our best
behaviors when we are single
shepherds facing a potential tragedy
of the commons. They make us less
selfish in Me versus Us situations.
But they send us hurtling toward
our worst behaviors when
confronting Thems and their
different moralities.
The dual process nature of moral decision making gives some
insights into how to avert these two very different types of tragedies.
In the context of Me versus Us, our moral intuitions are shared, and
emphasizing them hums with the prosociality of our Us-ness. This was
shown in a study by Greene, David Rand of Yale, and colleagues, where
subjects played a one-shot public-goods game that modeled the tragedy
of the commons.34 Subjects were given differing lengths of time to
decide how much money they would contribute to a common pot (versus
keeping it for themselves, to everyone else’s detriment). And the faster
the decision required, the more cooperative people were. Ditto if you had
primed subjects to value intuition (by having them relate a time when
intuition led them to a good decision or where careful reasoning did the
opposite)—more cooperation. Conversely, instruct subjects to “carefully
consider” their decision, or prime them to value reflection over intuition,
and they’d be more selfish. The more time to think, the more time to do a
version of “Yes, we all agree that cooperation is a good thing . . . but
here is why I should be exempt this time”—what the authors called
“calculated greed.”
What would happen if subjects played the game with someone
screamingly different, as different a human as you could find, by
whatever the subject’s standards of comfort and familiarity? While the
