Many instances of supposed HG warfare, on closer
inspection, were actually singular homicides.
Some violent Great Plains HG cultures were
untraditional in the sense of using something crucial that
didn’t exist in the Pleistocene—domesticated horses
ridden into battle.
Like non-Western agriculturalists or pastoralists,
contemporary HG are not equivalent to our ancestors.
Weapons invented in the last ten thousand years have
been introduced through trade; most HG cultures have
spent millennia being displaced by agriculturalists and
pastoralists, pushed into ever tougher, resource-sparse
ecosystems.
Once again, the cherry-picking issue, i.e., failure to cite
cases of peaceful HGs.
Most crucially, there’s more than one type of HG.
Nomadic HGs are the original brand, stretching back
hundreds of thousands of years.74 But in addition to HG
2.0 equestrians, there are “complex HGs,” who are
different—violent, not particularly egalitarian, and
sedentary, typically because they’re sitting on a rich
food source that they defend from outsiders. In other
words, a transitional form from pure HGs. And many of
the cultures cited by Ember, Keeley, and Pinker are
complex HGs. This difference is relevant to Nataruk,
that northern Kenyan site of a ten-thousand-year-old
massacre—skeletons of twenty-seven unburied people,
killed by clubbing, stabbing, or stone projectiles. The
victims were sedentary HGs, living alongside a shallow
bay on Lake Turkana, prime beachfront property with
easy fishing and plentiful game animals coming to the
water to drink. Just the sort of real estate that someone
else would try to muscle in on.
The most thoughtful and insightful analyses of HG violence come
from Fry and from Christopher Boehm of the University of Southern
California. They paint a complex picture.
