started there, which eventually grew into a network of people studying
“neurolaw.”
Fun, stimulating, interdisciplinary hybrid vigor. And frustrating to
me, because I kind of meant the title of the proposal that I had written.
The current criminal justice system needs to be abolished and replaced
with something that, while having some broad features in common with
the current system,* would have utterly different underpinnings. Which
I’m going to try to convince you of. And that’s just the first part of this
chapter.

You can’t be less controversial than stating that the criminal justice
system needs reform and that this should involve more science and less
pseudoscience in the courtroom. If nothing else, consider this: according
to the Innocence Project, nearly 350 people, a mind-boggling 20 of them
on death row, imprisoned an average of fourteen years, have been
exonerated by DNA fingerprinting.1
Despite that, I’m going to mostly ignore criminal justice reform by
science. Here are some hot-button topics in that realm that I’m going to
bypass entirely:
What to do about the power and ubiquity of automatic,
implicit biases (leading to, for example, juries meting
out harsher decisions to African American defendants
with darker skin). Should Implicit Association Tests be
used in jury selection to eliminate people with strong,
pertinent biases?
Whether neuroimaging information regarding a
defendant’s brain should be admissible in a courtroom.2
This has grown less contentious as neuroimaging has
transitioned from revolutionary to a standard approach
in science’s tool kit. But there remains the issue of
whether juries should be shown actual neuroimages—
the worry is that nonexperts are readily overly impressed
with exciting, color-enhanced Pictures of the Brain (it’s
turning out to be less of an issue than feared).
Whether neuroimaging data regarding someone’s
veracity should have a place in the courtroom (or in the
