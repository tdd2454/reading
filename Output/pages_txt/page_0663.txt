transported far more people than that.
Finally—the Potential for Collective Power
There is an anecdote from the Peninsular War of 1807–14, told by
Major General George Bell, then an ensign: There was a bridge
separating the opposing British and French, with a sentry posted by each
side to sound an alarm should the enemy rush across the bridge.55 A
British officer was making rounds and found the British sentry there in
an unlikely situation—carrying British and French muskets, one on each
shoulder, seemingly guarding the bridge for the two opposing armies,
with no French sentry in sight. His explanation? His French counterpart
had snuck off to buy some liquor for them to share and, naturally, he was
watching the other guy’s gun.
Fraternizing between enemy soldiers is remarkably frequent in war.
It’s most common when they’re the same race and major religion and
when they are enlisted men rather than officers. It’s also more common
when individual enemies, rather than groups, encounter each other, when
it’s the same person day after day (e.g., guarding the bridge opposite
you), when someone could have shot you but didn’t. Fraternizing rarely
involves discussions about life, death, and geopolitics; instead it’s things
like bartering food (since the other side’s rations can’t be as bad as
yours), cigarettes, or alcohol or complaining about the miserable
weather, the miserable officers.56
