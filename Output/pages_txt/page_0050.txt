THE FRONTAL CORTEX
I
’ve spent decades studying the hippocampus. It’s been good to me;
I’d like to think I’ve been the same in return. Yet I think I might have
made the wrong choice back then—maybe I should have studied the
frontal cortex all these years. Because it’s the most interesting part of the
brain.
What does the frontal cortex do? Its list of expertise includes
working memory, executive function (organizing knowledge
strategically, and then initiating an action based on an executive
decision), gratification postponement, long-term planning, regulation of
emotions, and reining in impulsivity.35
This is a sprawling portfolio. I will group these varied functions
under a single definition, pertinent to every page of this book: the frontal
cortex makes you do the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.
To start, here are some important features of the frontal cortex:
It’s the most recently evolved brain region, not approaching full
splendor until the emergence of primates; a disproportionate
percentage of genes unique to primates are active in the frontal
cortex. Moreover, such gene expression patterns are highly
individuated, with greater interindividual variability than average
levels of whole-brain differences between humans and chimps.
The human frontal cortex is more complexly wired than in other
apes and, by some definitions as to its boundaries,
proportionately bigger as well.36
The frontal cortex is the last brain region to fully mature, with
the most evolutionarily recent subparts the very last. Amazingly,
it’s not fully online until people are in their midtwenties. You’d
better bet this factoid will be relevant to the chapter about
adolescence.
