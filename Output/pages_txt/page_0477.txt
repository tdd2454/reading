the name of the foolishness of the crowd. When we
discover we are out of step with everyone else, our
amygdalae spasm with anxiety, our memories are
revised, and our sensory-processing regions are even
pressured to experience what is not true. All to fit in.
Finally, the pull of conformity and obedience can lead us
to some of our darkest, most appalling places, and far
more of us can be led there than we’d like to think. But
despite that, even the worst of barrels doesn’t turn all
apples bad, and “Resistance” and “Heroism” are often
more accessible and less rarefied and capitalized than
assumed. We’re rarely alone in thinking this is wrong,
wrong, wrong. And we are usually no less special or
unique than those before us who have fought back.
