PART I: GENES FROM THE BOTTOM UP
W
e start by considering the limited power of genes. If you are
shaky about topics such as the central dogma (DNA codes for
RNA, which codes for protein sequence), protein structure determining
function, the three-nucleotide codon code, or the basics of point,
insertion, and deletion mutations, first read the primer in appendix 3.
Do Genes Know What They Are Doing? The
Triumph of the Environment
So genes specify protein structure, shape, and function. And since
proteins do virtually everything, this makes DNA the holy grail of life.
But no—genes don’t “decide” when a new protein is made.
Dogma was that there’d be a stretch of DNA in a chromosome,
constituting a single gene, followed by a stop codon, followed
immediately by the next gene, and then the next. . . . But genes don’t
actually come one after another—not all DNA constitutes genes. Instead
there are stretches of DNA between genes that are noncoding, that are
not “transcribed.”* And now a flabbergasting number—95 percent of
DNA is noncoding. Ninety-five percent.
What is that 95 percent? Some is junk—remnants of pseudogenes
inactivated by evolution.*3 But buried in that are the keys to the
kingdom, the instruction manual for when to transcribe particular genes,
the on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t “decide” when
to be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead, before the
start of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a
promoter*—the “on” switch. What turns the promoter switch on?
Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter. This
causes the recruitment of enzymes that transcribe the gene into RNA.
Meanwhile, other transcription factors deactivate genes.
This is huge. Saying that a gene “decides” when it is transcribed* is
like saying that a recipe decides when a cake is baked.
