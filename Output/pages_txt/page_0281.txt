So which came first, 7R frequency or cultural style? The 4R and 7R
variants, along with the 2R, occur worldwide, implying they already
existed when humans radiated out of Africa 60,000 to 130,000 years ago.
Classic work by Kenneth Kidd of Yale, examining the distribution of 7R,
shows something remarkable.
Starting at the left of the figure above, there’s roughly a 10 to 25
percent incidence of 7R in various African, European, and Middle
Eastern populations. Jumping to the right side of the figure, there’s a
slightly higher incidence among the descendants of those who started
island-hopping from mainland Asia to Malaysia and New Guinea. The
same for folks whose ancestors migrated to North America via the
Bering land bridge about fifteen thousand years ago—the Muskoke,
Cheyenne, and Pima tribes of Native Americans. Then the Maya in
Central America—up to around 40 percent. Then the Guihiba and
