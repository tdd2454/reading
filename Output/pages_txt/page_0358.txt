STANDING ON THREE LEGS
W
e’ve now seen the three foundations of thinking about the
evolution of behavior—individual selection, kin selection, and
reciprocal altruism. Moreover, we’ve seen how these three concepts can
explain otherwise puzzling behaviors. Some concern individual
selection, with competitive infanticide as the canonical example. Other
behaviors are most explicable with kin selection—why there’s male-male
aggression between groups in only some primate species; why many
species have hereditary ranking systems; why cousin matings are more
frequent than one might expect. And some behaviors are all about
reciprocal altruism. Why else would a vampire bat, aware of the
vanquishing power of group selection, regurgitate blood for someone
else’s kid?
Let’s consider a few more examples.
Pair-Bonding Versus Tournament Species
Suppose you’ve discovered two new species of primates. Despite
watching both for years, here’s all you know: In species A, male and
females have similar body sizes, coloration, and musculature; in species
B, males are far bigger and more muscular than females and have flashy,
conspicuous facial coloration (jargon: species B is highly “sexually
dimorphic”). We’ll now see how these two facts allow you to accurately
predict a ton of things about these species.
