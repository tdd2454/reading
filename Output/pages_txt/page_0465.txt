Massacre, and the SPE became bitingly relevant thirty years later with
the abuse and torture of Iraqis at Abu Ghraib Prison by perfectly normal
American soldiers.*67
Zimbardo took a particularly extreme stance as to what these findings
mean, namely his “bad barrel” theory—the issue isn’t how a few bad
apples can ruin the whole barrel; it’s how a bad barrel can turn any apple
bad. In another apt metaphor, rather than concentrating on one evil
person at a time, what Zimbardo calls a “medical” approach, one must
understand how some environments cause epidemics of evil, a “public
health” approach. As he states: “Any deed, for good or evil, that any
human being has ever done, you and I could also do—given the same
situational forces.” Anyone could potentially be an abusive Milgram
teacher, Zimbardo guard, or goose-stepping Nazi. In a similar vein,
Milgram stated, “If a system of death camps were set up in the US of the
sorts we had seen in Nazi Germany one would be able to find sufficient
personnel for those camps in any medium-sized American town.” And as
stated by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in The Gulag Archipelago, in a quote
perpetually cited in this literature, “The line dividing good and evil cuts
through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a
piece of his own heart?”68
Some Different Takes
Big surprise—the studies and their conclusions, especially those of
Milgram and Zimbardo, have been controversial. Those two attracted
firestorms of controversy because of the unethical nature of the work;
some teachers and guards were psychological wrecks afterward, seeing
what they had proven capable of;* it changed the course of a number of
their lives.* No human-subjects committee would approve the Milgram
study these days; in contemporary versions subjects are ordered to, for
example, say increasingly insulting things to the learner or administer
virtual shocks, evoking virtual pain, in avatars (stay tuned).69
The controversies about the science itself in the Milgram and
Zimbardo studies are more pertinent. The Milgram edifice has been
questioned in three ways, most piercingly by the psychologist Gina
