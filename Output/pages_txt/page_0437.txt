which provocations to ignore and which coalitions to form,
understanding other individuals’ actions.
Does the monkey make history, or does history make the monkey?
Once groups were formed, did individuals who became dominant
respond with the biggest expansions of those brain regions? Or, prior to
group formation, were the individuals destined to become dominant
already endowed in those regions?
Unfortunately, animals weren’t imaged before and after group
formation in the study. However, subsequent work showed that the larger
the size of the group, the larger the association between dominance and
those brain changes, suggesting that attaining high rank drives the
enlargement.* In contrast, the mouse study showed that when synaptic
excitability was increased or decreased in the dlPFC, rank rose or
declined, respectively, suggesting that enlargement drives attainment of
high rank. The brain can shape behavior can shape the brain can

What about biological differences outside the brain as a function of
rank? For example, do high- and low-ranking males differ in their
testosterone profiles and, if there are differences, are they causes,
consequences, or mere correlates of the rank differences?
Folk endocrinology has always held that high rank (in any species)
and elevated testosterone levels go hand in hand, with the latter powering
the former. But as covered at length in chapter 4, neither is the case in
primates. As a reminder:
In stable hierarchies high-ranking males typically don’t
have the highest testosterone concentrations. Instead it’s
usually low-ranking adolescent males, starting fights
they can’t finish. When there is an association between
high rank and high testosterone, it generally reflects the
higher rates of sexual behavior among dominant
individuals driving secretion.
An exception to the above is during unstable times. For
example, among a number of primate species, high-
