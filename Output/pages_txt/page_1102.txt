* I heard a brutally cynical joke years ago built around the zero-sum notion that anything that is bad for Them is
automatically good for Us: So God appears to all the leaders on earth and announces that he is destroying the world because
of human sinfulness. The American president assembles his cabinet and says, “I have good news and bad news. God exists,
but he is going to destroy earth.” The premier of the Soviet Union (this was told during the atheistic days of the USSR) pulls
together his advisers and says, “I have bad news and worse news. God exists, and he’s going to destroy earth.” And the prime
minister of Israel tells his cabinet, “I have good news and great news. God exists, and he’s going to destroy the Palestinians
for us.”
