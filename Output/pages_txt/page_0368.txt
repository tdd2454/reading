twentieth century, an architect of the sociobiology synthesis along with a
number of other fields, a biology god. E. O. Wilson had long dismissed
David Sloan Wilson’s ideas. And then a few years back, the octogenarian
E. O. Wilson did something extraordinary—he decided he was wrong.
And then he published a key paper with the other Wilson—“Rethinking
the Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology.” My respect for these two,
both as people and as scientists, is enormous.47
Thus something resembling détente has occurred among the
advocates for the importance of differing levels of selection. Our three-
legged chair of individual selection, kin selection, and reciprocal
altruism seems more stable with four legs.
