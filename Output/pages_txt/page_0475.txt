SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We’re just like numerous other social species in terms of
having marked status differences among individuals and
hierarchies that emerge from those differences. Like
many of these other species, we’re fantastically attuned
to status differences, are sufficiently fascinated by them
that we monitor status relations in individuals who are
irrelevant to us, and can perceive status differences in a
blink of an eye. And we find it deeply unsettling, with
the amygdala leading front and center, when status
relations are ambiguous and shifting.
As in so many other species, our brains, particularly the
neocortex and most particularly the frontal cortex, have
coevolved with the social complexity of status
differences. It takes a lot of brainpower to make sense of
the subtleties of dominance relations. This is no surprise,
given that “knowing your place” can be so contextual.
Navigating status differences is most challenging when
it comes to attaining and maintaining high rank; this
requires cognitive mastery of Theory of Mind and
perspective taking; of manipulation, intimidation, and
deceit; and of impulse control and emotion regulation.
As with so many other primates, the biographies of our
most hierarchically successful members are built around
what provocations are ignored during occasions where
the frontal cortex kept a level head.
Our bodies and brains, like those of other social species,
bear the imprint of social status, and having the “wrong”
rank can be corrosively pathogenic. Moreover, the
physiology is not so much about rank per se as about its
social meaning in your species and particular group, the
behavioral advantages and disadvantages, and the
psychological baggage of a particular rank.
