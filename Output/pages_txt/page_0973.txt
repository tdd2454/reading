* Bowlby, unlike most Freudians and behaviorists, actually had extensive experience with children, including children in the
1940s separated from their mothers—London children sent to the countryside during the Blitz, Central European Jewish
children shipped to England in the Kindertransport rescues one step ahead of Hitler, and of course war orphans. BTW, what
was Bowlby’s childhood like? He was the son of Sir Anthony Bowlby, the king’s own surgeon, and was raised by nannies.
