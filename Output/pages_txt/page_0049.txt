indifference.

This concludes our overview of the amygdala. Amid the jargon and
complexity, the most important theme is the amygdala’s dual role in both
aggression and facets of fear and anxiety. Fear and aggression are not
inevitably intertwined—not all fear causes aggression, and not all
aggression is rooted in fear. Fear typically increases aggression only in
those already prone to it; among the subordinate who lack the option of
expressing aggression safely, fear does the opposite.
The dissociation between fear and aggression is evident in violent
psychopaths, who are the antithesis of fearful—both physiologically and
subjectively they are less reactive to pain; their amygdalae are relatively
unresponsive to typical fear-evoking stimuli and are smaller than
normal.34 This fits with the picture of psychopathic violence; it is not
done in aroused reaction to provocation. Instead, it is purely
instrumental, using others as a means to an end with emotionless,
remorseless, reptilian indifference.
Thus, fear and violence are not always connected at the hip. But a
connection is likely when the aggression evoked is reactive, frenzied,
and flecked with spittle. In a world in which no amygdaloid neuron need
be afraid and instead can sit under its vine and fig tree, the world is very
likely to be a more peaceful place.*
