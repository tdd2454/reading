* Two technical notes. Social monogamy of pair-bonding species doesn’t always translate into sexual monogamy.
“Tournament” is used by some solely to describe species in which the male-male competition literally takes the form of all
the males gathering for competitive displays (as in sage grouse or some ungulate species) but is also used by many, as here, to
more broadly describe multimale, multifemale promiscuous mating systems.
