CONCLUSIONS
A
t long last, you (and I!) have gotten to the end of this
excruciatingly but necessarily long chapter. Amid all these tiny
effects and technical limitations, it’s important to not throw out the
genetic baby with the bathwater, as has been an agitated sociopolitical
goal at times (during my intellectual youth in the 1970s, sandwiched
between the geologic periods of Cranberry Bell-bottoms and of John
Travolta White Suits was the Genes-Have-Nothing-to-Do-with-Behavior
Ice Age).
Genes have plenty to do with behavior. Even more appropriately, all
behavioral traits are affected to some degree by genetic variability.65
They have to be, given that they specify the structure of all the proteins
pertinent to every neurotransmitter, hormone, receptor, etc. that there is.
And they have plenty to do with individual differences in behavior, given
the large percentage of genes that are polymorphic, coming in different
flavors. But their effects are supremely context dependent. Ask not what
a gene does. Ask what it does in a particular environment and when
expressed in a particular network of other genes (i.e.,
gene/gene/gene/gene . . . /environment).
Thus, for our purposes, genes aren’t about inevitability. Instead
they’re about context-dependent tendencies, propensities, potentials, and
vulnerabilities. All embedded in the fabric of the other factors, biological
and otherwise, that fill these pages.
Now that this chapter’s done, why don’t we all take a bathroom break
and then see what’s in the refrigerator.
