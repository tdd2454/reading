* A fascinating, grotesque example of this is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, where a woman (it’s overwhelmingly a
female disorder) generates illnesses in her child out of a pathological need for the attention, care, and envelopment of the
medical system. This is not someone falsely telling the pediatrician that her child had a fever last night. This is giving
children emetics to induce vomiting, poisoning them, smothering them to induce symptoms of hypoxia—often with fatal
consequences. One feature of the disorder is a stunning lack of affect in the mothers. One would expect an air of spittle-
flecked madness to match the actions. Instead, there is cold detachment, as if they could simply be lying to a veterinarian
about their supposedly sick goldfish or to customer service at Sears about their supposedly broken toaster, if doing so would
bring the same psychological benefits. For a lengthy overview of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, see R. Sapolsky,
“Nursery Crimes,” in Monkeyluv and Other Essays on Our Lives as Animals (New York: Simon and Schuster/Scribner,
2005).
