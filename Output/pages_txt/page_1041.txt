* I once got to experience what this looks like for an extended stretch, as I traveled with a group of Somalis who were driving
empty gasoline tankers back from Sudan to the Indian Ocean in Kenya for refilling. At the end of each day of driving through
the desert, we’d sit around a campfire between the trucks, cooking a pot of spaghetti and camel’s milk. (Why that particular
combo? That’s a whole other story. . . .) And inevitably one of the six Somalis would do something that was perceived as
insulting by someone. There would be snarling, angry words, knives drawn from boots, two guys circling and lunging at each
other until everyone else roused themselves to get the two to settle down. And then, the hospitality flip side of the culture on
display, everyone would hurry over to make sure I got the best of the spaghetti/milk glob. “Eat, eat. You are our brother,”
they’d say, including whichever two had just been slashing at each other.
