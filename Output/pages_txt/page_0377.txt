THE USUAL: WHERE ARE THE GENES?
I
pointed out earlier a requirement for neo–group selection, namely that
genes be involved in a trait that differs more between than within groups.
This applies to everything in this chapter. The first requirement for a trait
to evolve is that it be heritable. But this is often forgotten along the way,
as evolutionary models tacitly assume genetic influences. Chapter 8
showed how tenuous is the idea that there is “the gene,” or even genes,
“for” aggression, intelligence, empathy, and so on. Given that, even more
tenuous would be the idea of a gene(s) for maximizing your reproductive
success by, say, “mating indiscriminately with every available female,”
or by “abandoning your kids and finding a new mate, because the father
will raise them.”
So critics will often demand, “Show me the gene that you assume is
there.” And sociobiologists will respond, “Show me a more
parsimonious explanation than this assumption.”
