between childhood adversity and adult depression involves both
organizational effects on the developing mesolimbic system and elevated
adult glucocorticoid levels, which can deplete dopamine.39
Childhood adversity increases depression risk via “second hit”
scenarios—lowering thresholds so that adult stressors that people
typically manage instead trigger depressive episodes. This vulnerability
makes sense. Depression is fundamentally a pathological sense of loss of
control (explaining the classic description of depression as “learned
helplessness”). If a child experiences severe, uncontrollable adversity,
the most fortunate conclusion in adulthood is “Those were terrible
circumstances over which I had no control.” But when childhood
traumas produce depression, there is cognitively distorted
overgeneralization: “And life will always be uncontrollably awful.”
