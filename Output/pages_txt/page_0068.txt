THE MESOLIMBIC/MESOCORTICAL
DOPAMINE SYSTEM
R
eward, pleasure, and happiness are complex, and the motivated
pursuit of them occurs in at least a rudimentary form in many
species. The neurotransmitter dopamine is central to understanding this.
Nuclei, Inputs, and Outputs
Dopamine is synthesized in multiple brain regions. One such region
helps initiate movement; damage there produces Parkinson’s disease.
Another regulates the release of a pituitary hormone. But the
dopaminergic system that concerns us arises from an ancient,
evolutionarily conserved region near the brain stem called the ventral
tegmental area (henceforth the “tegmentum”).
A key target of these dopaminergic neurons is the last multisyllabic
brain region to be introduced in this chapter, the nucleus accumbens
(henceforth the “accumbens”). There’s debate as to whether the
accumbens should count as part of the limbic system, but at the least it’s
highly limbic-ish.
Here’s our first pass at the organization of this circuitry:76
a. The tegmentum sends projections to the accumbens and
(other) limbic areas such as the amygdala and
hippocampus. This is collectively called the
“mesolimbic dopamine pathway.”
b. The tegmentum also projects to the PFC (but,
significantly, not other cortical areas). This is called the
“mesocortical dopamine pathway.” I’ll be lumping the
mesolimbic plus mesocortical pathways together as the
“dopaminergic system,” ignoring their not always being
activated simultaneously.*
