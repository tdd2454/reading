Some regions have very distinct and compact
subregions, and each is referred to as a “nucleus.” (This
is confusing, as the part of every cell that contains the
DNA is also called the nucleus. What can you do?)
Some probably totally unfamiliar names, just as
examples: the basal nucleus of Meynert, the supraoptic
nucleus of the hypothalamus, the charmingly named
inferior olive nucleus.
As described, the cell bodies of neurons with related
functions are clumped together in their particular region
or nucleus and send their axonal projections off in the
same direction, merging together into a cable (a “fiber
tract”). Here’s an example, taken from the hippocampus:
Back to that myelin wrapping around axons that helps
action potentials propagate faster. Myelin tends to be
white, sufficiently so that the fiber tract cables in the
brain look white. Thus they’re generically referred to as
“white matter.”
As can be seen, a lot of the brain is taken up by the fiber
tracts—all sorts of regions are talking to one another,
often distant parts.*
