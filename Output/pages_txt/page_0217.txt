Male rhesus monkeys show a strong preference for playing with stereotypically
“masculine” versus “feminine” human toys.

Goy studied highly sexually dimorphic rhesus monkeys. There were
already hints that testosterone has organizational effects on their
behavior—within weeks of birth, males are more active than females and
spend more time in rough-and-tumble play. This is long before puberty
and its burst of testosterone secretion. Furthermore, even if you suppress
their testosterone levels at birth (low, but nevertheless still higher than
those of females), males still do more roughing and tumbling. This
suggested that the sex difference arose from fetal hormone differences.
Goy proved this by treating pregnant monkeys with testosterone and
examining their female offspring. Testosterone exposure throughout
pregnancy produced daughters who were “pseudohermaphrodites”—
looked like males on the outside but had female gonads on the inside.
When compared with control females, these androgenized females did
more rough-and-tumble play, were more aggressive, and displayed male-
typical mounting behavior and vocalizations (as much as males, by some
measures). Importantly, most but not all behaviors were masculinized,
