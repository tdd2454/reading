* Dogs differed from primates in two interesting ways that make sense, both dogwise and primatewise. Primates would get
pissed and stop working if there was a difference in the quality of the reward (grape versus cucumber); in contrast, dogs
didn’t distinguish quality (bread versus sausage), only whether one was rewarded and the other not. Second, while many
monkeys refused to accept an eventual reward and would never cooperate again, dogs all eventually came around, after
enough entreaties to “shake” by the human.
