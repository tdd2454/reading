neurobiological activation differs when the same act is
carried out volitionally versus obediently.74
Nonetheless, there are always those who resist.
This second finding is no surprise, given Hutus who died shielding
Tutsi neighbors from Hutu death squads, Germans with every
opportunity to look the other way who risked everything to save people
from the Nazis, the informant who exposed Abu Ghraib. Some apples,
even in the worst of barrels, do not go bad.*
Thus what becomes vital is to understand the circumstances that push
us toward actions we thought we were far better than or that reveal
strength we never suspected we had.
Modulators of the Pressures to Conform and Obey
The end of the previous chapter examined factors that lessen
Us/Them dichotomizing. These included becoming aware of implicit,
automatic biases; becoming aware of our sensitivity to disgust,
resentment, and envy; recognizing the multiplicity of Us/Them
dichotomies that we harbor and emphasizing ones in which a Them
becomes an Us; contact with a Them under the right circumstances;
resisting essentialism; perspective taking; and, most of all, individuating
Thems.
Similar factors decrease the likelihood of people doing appalling
things in the name of conformity or obedience. These include:
THE NATURE OF THE AUTHORITY OR GROUP PRESSING FOR
CONFORMITY
Does the authority(s) evoke veneration, identification, pants-wetting
terror? Is the authority in close proximity? Milgram follow-ups showed
that when the authority (i.e., the scientist) was in a different room,
compliance decreased. Does the authority come cloaked in prestige?
When the experiment was conducted in some nondescript warehouse in
New Haven, instead of on the Yale campus, compliance declined. And,
as emphasized by Tajfel in his writing, is the authority perceived as
legitimate and stable? I’d more likely comply with, say, lifestyle advice
issued by the Dalai Lama than by the head of Boko Haram.
