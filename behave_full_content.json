    "content": "he fantasy always runs like this: A team of us has fought our way\ninto his secret bunker. Okay, it’s a fantasy, let’s go whole hog. I’ve\nsingle-handedly neutralized his elite guard and have burst into his\nbunker, my Browning machine gun at the ready. He lunges for his Luger;\nI knock it out of his hand. He lunges for the cyanide pill he keeps to\ncommit suicide rather than be captured. I knock that out of his hand as\nwell. He snarls in rage, attacks with otherworldly strength. We grapple; I\nmanage to gain the upper hand and pin him down and handcuff him.\n“Adolf Hitler,” I announce, “I arrest you for crimes against humanity.”\nAnd this is where the medal-of-honor version of the fantasy ends and\nthe imagery darkens. What would I do with Hitler? The viscera become\nso raw that I switch to passive voice in my mind, to get some distance.\nWhat should be done with Hitler? It’s easy to imagine, once I allow\nmyself. Sever his spine at the neck, leave him paralyzed but with\nsensation. Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument. Puncture his\neardrums, rip out his tongue. Keep him alive, tube-fed, on a respirator.\nImmobile, unable to speak, to see, to hear, only able to feel. Then inject\nhim with something that will give him a cancer that festers and\npustulates in every corner of his body, that will grow and grow until\nevery one of his cells shrieks with agony, till every moment feels like an\ninfinity spent in the fires of hell. That’s what should be done with Hitler.\nThat’s what I would want done to Hitler. That’s what I would do to\nHitler.\n—\nI’ve had versions of this fantasy since I was a kid. Still do at times. And\nwhen I really immerse myself in it, my heart rate quickens, I flush, my\npunishment should be relevant to criminal justice. But there’s a problem\nwith that, in turn—I sure feel like some people should be put to death,\nyet I oppose the death penalty. I’ve enjoyed plenty of violent, schlocky\nmovies, despite being in favor of strict gun control. And I sure had fun\nwhen, at some kid’s birthday party and against various unformed\nprinciples in my mind, I played laser tag, shooting at strangers from\nhiding places (fun, that is, until some pimply kid zapped me, like, a\nmillion times and then snickered at me, which made me feel insecure and\nunmanly). Yet at the same time, I know most of the lyrics to “Down by\nthe Riverside” (“ain’t gonna study war no more”) plus when you’re\nsupposed to clap your hands.\nIn other words, I have a confused array of feelings and thoughts\nabout violence, aggression, and competition. Just like most humans.\nTo preach from an obvious soapbox, our species has problems with\nviolence. We have the means to create thousands of mushroom clouds;\nshower heads and subway ventilation systems have carried poison gas,\nletters have carried anthrax, passenger planes have become weapons;\nmass rapes can constitute a military strategy; bombs go off in markets,\nschoolchildren with guns massacre other children; there are\nneighborhoods where everyone from pizza delivery guys to firefighters\nfears for their safety. And there are the subtler versions of violence—say,\na childhood of growing up abused, or the effects on a minority people\nwhen the symbols of the majority shout domination and menace. We are\nalways shadowed by the threat of other humans harming us.\nIf that were solely the way things are, violence would be an easy\nproblem to approach intellectually. AIDS—unambiguously bad news—\neradicate. Alzheimer’s disease—same thing. Schizophrenia, cancer,\nmalnutrition, flesh-eating bacteria, global warming, comets hitting earth\n—ditto.\nThe problem, though, is that violence doesn’t go on that list.\nSometimes we have no problem with it at all.\nThis is a central point of this book—we don’t hate violence. We hate\nand fear the wrong kind of violence, violence in the wrong context.\nBecause violence in the right context is different. We pay good money to\nnames celebrate violence—Warriors, Vikings, Lions, Tigers, and Bears.\nWe even think this way about something as cerebral as chess\n—“Kasparov kept pressing for a murderous attack. Toward the end,\nKasparov had to oppose threats of violence with more of the same.”1 We\nbuild theologies around violence, elect leaders who excel at it, and in the\ncase of so many women, preferentially mate with champions of human\ncombat. When it’s the “right” type of aggression, we love it.\nIt is the ambiguity of violence, that we can pull a trigger as an act of\nhideous aggression or of self-sacrificing love, that is so challenging. As a\nresult, violence will always be a part of the human experience that is\nprofoundly hard to understand.\nThis book explores the biology of violence, aggression, and\ncompetition—the behaviors and the impulses behind them, the acts of\nindividuals, groups, and states, and when these are bad or good things. It\nis a book about the ways in which humans harm one another. But it is\nalso a book about the ways in which people do the opposite. What does\nbiology teach us about cooperation, affiliation, reconciliation, empathy,\nand altruism?\nThe book has a number of personal roots. One is that, having had\nblessedly little personal exposure to violence in my life, the entire\nphenomenon scares the crap out of me. I think like an academic egghead,\nbelieving that if I write enough paragraphs about a scary subject, give\nenough lectures about it, it will give up and go away quietly. And if\neveryone took enough classes about the biology of violence and studied\nhard, we’d all be able to take a nap between the snoozing lion and lamb.\nSuch is the delusional sense of efficacy of a professor.\nThen there’s the other personal root for this book. I am by nature\nmajorly pessimistic. Give me any topic and I’ll find a way in which\nthings will fall apart. Or turn out wonderfully and somehow, because of\nthat, be poignant and sad. It’s a pain in the butt, especially to people\nstuck around me. And when I had kids, I realized that I needed to get\nahold of this tendency big time. So I looked for evidence that things\nweren’t quite that bad. I started small, practicing on them—don’t cry, a T.\nrex would never come and eat you; of course Nemo’s daddy will find\n10\nanother are neither universal nor inevitable, and we’re getting some\nscientific insights into how to avoid them. My pessimistic self has a hard\ntime admitting this, but there is room for optimism.\n\nmake my living as a combination neurobiologist—someone who\nstudies the brain—and primatologist—someone who studies monkeys\nand apes. Therefore, this is a book that is rooted in science, specifically\nbiology. And out of that come three key points. First, you can’t begin to\nunderstand things like aggression, competition, cooperation, and\nempathy without biology; I say this for the benefit of a certain breed of\nsocial scientist who finds biology to be irrelevant and a bit ideologically\nsuspect when thinking about human social behavior. But just as\nimportant, second, you’re just as much up the creek if you rely only on\nbiology; this is said for the benefit of a style of molecular fundamentalist\nwho believes that the social sciences are destined to be consumed by\n“real” science. And as a third point, by the time you finish this book,\nyou’ll see that it actually makes no sense to distinguish between aspects\nof a behavior that are “biological” and those that would be described as,\nsay, “psychological” or “cultural.” Utterly intertwined.\nUnderstanding the biology of these human behaviors is obviously\nimportant. But unfortunately it is hellishly complicated.2 Now, if you\nwere interested in the biology of, say, how migrating birds navigate, or in\nthe mating reflex that occurs in female hamsters when they’re ovulating,\nthis would be an easier task. But that’s not what we’re interested in.\nInstead, it’s human behavior, human social behavior, and in many cases\nabnormal human social behavior. And it is indeed a mess, a subject\ninvolving brain chemistry, hormones, sensory cues, prenatal\nenvironment, early experience, genes, both biological and cultural\nevolution, and ecological pressures, among other things.\nHow are we supposed to make sense of all these factors in thinking\nabout behavior? We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing\nwith complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those\nseparate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation. Suppose\nthere’s a rooster standing next to you, and there’s a chicken across the\nstreet. The rooster gives a sexually solicitive gesture that is hot by\nwould be “Because circulating estrogen levels in that chicken worked in\na certain part of her brain to make her responsive to this male signaling,”\nand if you’re a bioengineer, the answer would be “Because the long bone\nin the leg of the chicken forms a fulcrum for her pelvis (or some such\nthing), allowing her to move forward rapidly,” and if you’re an\nevolutionary biologist, you’d say, “Because over the course of millions\nof years, chickens that responded to such gestures at a time that they\nwere fertile left more copies of their genes, and thus this is now an innate\nbehavior in chickens,” and so on, thinking in categories, in differing\nscientific disciplines of explanation.\nThe goal of this book is to avoid such categorical thinking. Putting\nfacts into nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its\nadvantages—for example, it can help you remember facts better. But it\ncan wreak havoc on your ability to think about those facts. This is\nbecause the boundaries between different categories are often arbitrary,\nbut once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget that it is arbitrary and\nget way too impressed with its importance. For example, the visual\nspectrum is a continuum of wavelengths from violet to red, and it is\narbitrary where boundaries are put for different color names (for\nexample, where we see a transition from “blue” to “green”); as proof of\nthis, different languages arbitrarily split up the visual spectrum at\ndifferent points in coming up with the words for different colors. Show\nsomeone two roughly similar colors. If the color-name boundary in that\nperson’s language happens to fall between the two colors, the person will\noverestimate the difference between the two. If the colors fall in the\nsame category, the opposite happens. In other words, when you think\ncategorically, you have trouble seeing how similar or different two things\nare. If you pay lots of attention to where boundaries are, you pay less\nattention to complete pictures.\nThus, the official intellectual goal of this book is to avoid using\ncategorical buckets when thinking about the biology of some of our most\ncomplicated behaviors, even more complicated than chickens crossing\nroads.\nWhat’s the replacement?\nearlier in time. What sight, sound, or smell in the previous seconds to\nminutes triggered the nervous system to produce that behavior? On to the\nnext explanatory category. What hormones acted hours to days earlier to\nchange how responsive that individual was to the sensory stimuli that\ntrigger the nervous system to produce the behavior? And by now you’ve\nincreased your field of vision to be thinking about neurobiology and the\nsensory world of our environment and short-term endocrinology in\ntrying to explain what happened.\nAnd you just keep expanding. What features of the environment in\nthe prior weeks to years changed the structure and function of that\nperson’s brain and thus changed how it responded to those hormones and\nenvironmental stimuli? Then you go further back to the childhood of the\nindividual, their fetal environment, then their genetic makeup. And then\nyou increase the view to encompass factors larger than that one\nindividual—how has culture shaped the behavior of people living in that\nindividual’s group?—what ecological factors helped shape that culture—\nexpanding and expanding until considering events umpteen millennia\nago and the evolution of that behavior.\nOkay, so this represents an improvement—it seems like instead of\ntrying to explain all of behavior with a single discipline (e.g.,\n“Everything can be explained with knowledge about this particular [take\nyour pick:] hormone/gene/childhood event”), we’ll be thinking about a\nbunch of disciplinary buckets. But something subtler will be done, and\nthis is the most important idea in the book: when you explain a behavior\nwith one of these disciplines, you are implicitly invoking all the\ndisciplines—any given type of explanation is the end product of the\ninfluences that preceded it. It has to work this way. If you say, “The\nbehavior occurred because of the release of neurochemical Y in the\nbrain,” you are also saying, “The behavior occurred because the heavy\nsecretion of hormone X this morning increased the levels of\nneurochemical Y.” You’re also saying, “The behavior occurred because\nthe environment in which that person was raised made her brain more\nlikely to release neurochemical Y in response to certain types of stimuli.”\nAnd you’re also saying, “. . . because of the gene that codes for the\nThere are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the\nend product of all the biological influences that came before it and will\ninfluence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude\nthat a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma,\nbecause the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto\ninvoking them all. No buckets. A “neurobiological” or “genetic” or\n“developmental” explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an\nexpository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole\nmultifactorial arc from a particular perspective.\nPretty impressive, huh? Actually, maybe not. Maybe I’m just\npretentiously saying, “You have to think complexly about complex\nthings.” Wow, what a revelation. And maybe what I’ve been tacitly\nsetting up is this full-of-ourselves straw man of “Ooh, we’re going to\nthink subtly. We won’t get suckered into simplistic answers, not like\nthose chicken-crossing-the-road neurochemists and chicken evolutionary\nbiologists and chicken psychoanalysts, all living in their own limited\ncategorical buckets.”\nObviously, scientists aren’t like that. They’re smart. They understand\nthat they need to take lots of angles into account. Of necessity, their\nresearch may focus on a narrow subject, because there are limits to how\nmuch one person can obsess over. But of course they know that their\nparticular categorical bucket isn’t the whole story.\nMaybe yes, maybe no. Consider the following quotes from some\ncard-carrying scientists. The first:\nGive me a dozen healthy infants, well formed, and my own\nspecified world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take any\none at random and train him to become any type of specialist I\nmight select—doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and yes, even\nbeggar-man thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies,\nabilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors.3\nThis was John Watson, a founder of behaviorism, writing around\n1925. Behaviorism, with its notion that behavior is completely malleable,\nenvironmental influences on development. “I’ll guarantee . . . to train\nhim to become any type.” Yet we are not all born the same, with the\nsame potential, regardless of how we are trained.*4\nThe next quote:\nNormal psychic life depends upon the good functioning of brain\nsynapses, and mental disorders appear as a result of synaptic\nderangements. . . . It is necessary to alter these synaptic\nadjustments and change the paths chosen by the impulses in their\nconstant passage so as to modify the corresponding ideas and\nforce thought into different channels.5\nAlter synaptic adjustments. Sounds delicate. Yeah, right. These were\nthe words of the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, around the time he\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949 for his development of frontal\nleukotomies. Here was an individual pathologically stuck in a bucket\nhaving to do with a crude version of the nervous system. Just tweak\nthose microscopic synapses with a big ol’ ice pick (as was done once\nleukotomies, later renamed frontal lobotomies, became an assembly line\noperation).\nAnd a final quote:\nThe immensely high reproduction rate in the moral imbecile has\nlong been established. . . . Socially inferior human material is\nenabled . . . to penetrate and finally to annihilate the healthy\nnation. The selection for toughness, heroism, social utility . . .\nmust be accomplished by some human institution if mankind, in\ndefault of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-\ninduced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has\nalready accomplished much in this respect. We must—and should\n—rely on the healthy feelings of our Best and charge them . . .\nprograms.7 Grandfatherly Konrad, in his Austrian shorts and suspenders,\nbeing followed by his imprinted baby geese, was also a rabid Nazi\npropagandist. Lorenz joined the Nazi Party the instant Austrians were\neligible, and joined the party’s Office of Race Policy, working to\npsychologically screen Poles of mixed Polish/German parentage, helping\nto determine which were sufficiently Germanized to be spared death.\nHere was a man pathologically mired in an imaginary bucket related to\ngross misinterpretations of what genes do.\nThese were not obscure scientists producing fifth-rate science at\nPodunk U. These were among the most influential scientists of the\ntwentieth century. They helped shape who and how we educate and our\nviews on what social ills are fixable and when we shouldn’t bother. They\nenabled the destruction of the brains of people against their will. And\nthey helped implement final solutions for problems that didn’t exist. It\nHUMAN VERSATILITY AT BEING\nAGGRESSIVE\no we have a first intellectual challenge, which is to always think in\nthis interdisciplinary way. The second challenge is to make sense of\nhumans as apes, primates, mammals. Oh, that’s right, we’re a kind of\nanimal. And it will be a challenge to figure out when we’re just like\nother animals and when we are utterly different.\nSome of the time we are indeed just like any other animal. When\nwe’re scared, we secrete the same hormone as would some subordinate\nfish getting hassled by a bully. The biology of pleasure involves the same\nbrain chemicals in us as in a capybara. Neurons from humans and brine\nshrimp work the same way. House two female rats together, and over the\ncourse of weeks they will synchronize their reproductive cycles so that\nthey wind up ovulating within a few hours of each other. Try the same\nwith two human females (as reported in some but not all studies), and\nsomething similar occurs. It’s called the Wellesley effect, first shown\nwith roommates at all-women’s Wellesley College.8 And when it comes\nto violence, we can be just like some other apes—we pummel, we\ncudgel, we throw rocks, we kill with our bare hands.\nSo some of the time an intellectual challenge is to assimilate how\nsimilar we can be to other species. In other cases the challenge is to\nappreciate how, though human physiology resembles that of other\nspecies, we use the physiology in novel ways. We activate the classical\nphysiology of vigilance while watching a scary movie. We activate a\nstress response when thinking about mortality. We secrete hormones\nrelated to nurturing and social bonding, but in response to an adorable\nbaby panda. And this certainly applies to aggression—we use the same\nmuscles as does a male chimp attacking a sexual competitor, but we use\nthem to harm someone because of their ideology.\nFinally, sometimes the only way to understand our humanness is to\nmultigenerationally, even between two individuals separated by\nmillennia—just consider that perennial best seller, the Bible. Consonant\nwith that, we can harm by doing things as unprecedented as and no more\nphysically taxing than pulling a trigger, or nodding consent, or looking\nthe other way. We can be passive-aggressive, damn with faint praise, cut\nwith scorn, express contempt with patronizing concern. All species are\nunique, but we are unique in some pretty unique ways.\nHere are two examples of just how strange and unique humans can\nbe when they go about harming one another and caring for one another.\nThe first example involves, well, my wife. So we’re in the minivan, our\nkids in the back, my wife driving. And this complete jerk cuts us off,\nalmost causing an accident, and in a way that makes it clear that it wasn’t\ndistractedness on his part, just sheer selfishness. My wife honks at him,\nand he flips us off. We’re livid, incensed. Asshole-where’s-the-cops-\nwhen-you-need-them, etc. And suddenly my wife announces that we’re\ngoing to follow him, make him a little nervous. I’m still furious, but this\ndoesn’t strike me as the most prudent thing in the world. Nonetheless,\nmy wife starts trailing him, right on his rear.\nAfter a few minutes the guy’s driving evasively, but my wife’s on\nhim. Finally both cars stop at a red light, one that we know is a long one.\nAnother car is stopped in front of the villain. He’s not going anywhere.\nSuddenly my wife grabs something from the front seat divider, opens her\ndoor, and says, “Now he’s going to be sorry.” I rouse myself feebly\n—“Uh, honey, do you really think this is such a goo—” But she’s out of\nthe car, starts pounding on his window. I hurry over just in time to hear\nmy wife say, “If you could do something that mean to another person,\nyou probably need this,” in a venomous voice. She then flings something\nin the window. She returns to the car triumphant, just glorious.\n“What did you throw in there!?”\nShe’s not talking yet. The light turns green, there’s no one behind us,\nand we just sit there. The thug’s car starts to blink a very sensible turn\nindicator, makes a slow turn, and heads down a side street into the dark\nat, like, five miles an hour. If it’s possible for a car to look ashamed, this\ncar was doing it.\nreally wrong in your childhood, and maybe this lollipop will help correct\nthat just a little.” That guy was going to think twice before screwing with\nus again. I swelled with pride and love.\nAnd the second example: In the mid-1960s, a rightist military coup\noverthrew the government of Indonesia, instituting the thirty-year\ndictatorship of Suharto known as the New Order. Following the coup,\ngovernment-sponsored purges of communists, leftists, intellectuals,\nunionists, and ethnic Chinese left about a half million dead.9 Mass\nexecutions, torture, villages torched with inhabitants trapped inside. V. S.\nNaipaul, in his book Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey, describes\nhearing rumors while in Indonesia that when a paramilitary group would\narrive to exterminate every person in some village, they would,\nincongruously, bring along a traditional gamelan orchestra. Eventually\nNaipaul encountered an unrepentant veteran of a massacre, and he asked\nhim about the rumor. Yes, it is true. We would bring along gamelan\nmusicians, singers, flutes, gongs, the whole shebang. Why? Why would\nyou possibly do that? The man looked puzzled and gave what seemed to\nhim a self-evident answer: “Well, to make it more beautiful.”\nBamboo flutes, burning villages, the lollipop ballistics of maternal\nlove. We have our work cut out for us, trying to understand the virtuosity"

    "content": "The Behavior\ne have our strategy in place. A behavior has occurred—one\nthat is reprehensible, or wonderful, or floating ambiguously in\nbetween. What occurred in the prior second that triggered the behavior?\nThis is the province of the nervous system. What occurred in the prior\nseconds to minutes that triggered the nervous system to produce that\nbehavior? This is the world of sensory stimuli, much of it sensed\nunconsciously. What occurred in the prior hours to days to change the\nsensitivity of the nervous system to such stimuli? Acute actions of\nhormones. And so on, all the way back to the evolutionary pressures\nplayed out over the prior millions of years that started the ball rolling.\nSo we’re set. Except that when approaching this big sprawling mess\nof a subject, it is kind of incumbent upon you to first define your terms.\nWhich is an unwelcome prospect.\nHere are some words of central importance to this book: aggression,\nviolence, compassion, empathy, sympathy, competition, cooperation,\naltruism, envy, schadenfreude, spite, forgiveness, reconciliation, revenge,\nreciprocity, and (why not?) love. Flinging us into definitional quagmires.\nWhy the difficulty? As emphasized in the introduction, one reason is\nthat so many of these terms are the subject of ideological battles over the\nappropriation and distortions of their meanings.*1 Words pack power and\nthese definitions are laden with values, often wildly idiosyncratic ones.\nHere’s an example, namely the ways I think about the word\n“competition”: (a) “competition”—your lab team races the Cambridge\ngroup to a discovery (exhilarating but embarrassing to admit to); (b)\n“competition”—playing pickup soccer (fine, as long as the best player\ndeity is more worth killing for? (try to avoid).\nBut the biggest reason for the definitional challenge was emphasized\nin the introduction—these terms mean different things to scientists living\ninside different disciplines. Is “aggression” about thought, emotion, or\nsomething done with muscles? Is “altruism” something that can be\nstudied mathematically in various species, including bacteria, or are we\ndiscussing moral development in kids? And implicit in these different\nperspectives, disciplines have differing tendencies toward lumping and\nsplitting—these scientists believe that behavior X consists of two\ndifferent subtypes, whereas those scientists think it comes in seventeen\nflavors.\nLet’s examine this with respect to different types of “aggression.”2\nAnimal behaviorists dichotomize between offensive and defensive\naggression, distinguishing between, say, the intruder and the resident of a\nterritory; the biology underlying these two versions differs. Such\nscientists also distinguish between conspecific aggression (between\nmembers of the same species) and fighting off a predator. Meanwhile,\ncriminologists distinguish between impulsive and premeditated\naggression. Anthropologists care about differing levels of organization\nunderlying aggression, distinguishing among warfare, clan vendettas,\nand homicide.\nMoreover, various disciplines distinguish between aggression that\noccurs reactively (in response to provocation) and spontaneous\naggression, as well as between hot-blooded, emotional aggression and\ncold-blooded, instrumental aggression (e.g., “I want your spot to build\nmy nest, so scram or I’ll peck your eyes out; this isn’t personal,\nthough”).3 Then there’s another version of “This isn’t personal”—\ntargeting someone just because they’re weak and you’re frustrated,\nstressed, or pained and need to displace some aggression. Such third-\nparty aggression is ubiquitous—shock a rat and it’s likely to bite the\nsmaller guy nearby; a beta-ranking male baboon loses a fight to the\nalpha, and he chases the omega male;* when unemployment rises, so do\nrates of domestic violence. Depressingly, as will be discussed in chapter\nThen there are specialized subtypes of aggression—maternal\naggression, which often has a distinctive endocrinology. There’s the\ndifference between aggression and ritualistic threats of aggression. For\nexample, many primates have lower rates of actual aggression than of\nritualized threats (such as displaying their canines). Similarly, aggression\nin Siamese fighting fish is mostly ritualistic.*\nGetting a definitional handle on the more positive terms isn’t easy\neither. There’s empathy versus sympathy, reconciliation versus\nforgiveness, and altruism versus “pathological altruism.”4 For a\npsychologist the last term might describe the empathic codependency of\nenabling a partner’s drug use. For a neuroscientist it describes a\nconsequence of a type of damage to the frontal cortex—in economic\ngames of shifting strategies, individuals with such damage fail to switch\nto less altruistic play when being repeatedly stabbed in the back by the\nother player, despite being able to verbalize the other player’s strategy.\nWhen it comes to the more positive behaviors, the most pervasive\nissue is one that ultimately transcends semantics—does pure altruism\nactually exist? Can you ever separate doing good from the expectation of\nreciprocity, public acclaim, self-esteem, or the promise of paradise?\nThis plays out in a fascinating realm, as reported in Larissa\nMacFarquhar’s 2009 New Yorker piece “The Kindest Cut.”5 It concerns\npeople who donate organs not to family members or close friends but to\nstrangers. An act of seemingly pure altruism. But these Samaritans\nunnerve everyone, sowing suspicion and skepticism. Is she expecting to\nget paid secretly for her kidney? Is she that desperate for attention? Will\nshe work her way into the recipient’s life and do a Fatal Attraction?\nWhat’s her deal? The piece suggests that these profound acts of goodness\nunnerve because of their detached, affectless nature.\nThis speaks to an important point that runs through the book. As\nnoted, we distinguish between hot-blooded and cold-blooded violence.\nWe understand the former more, can see mitigating factors in it—\nconsider the grieving, raging man who kills the killer of his child. And\nconversely, affectless violence seems horrifying and incomprehensible;\nthis is the sociopathic contract killer, the Hannibal Lecter who kills\noxymoronic, is unsettling. I was once at a conference of neuroscientists\nand all-star Buddhist monk meditators, the former studying what the\nbrains of the latter did during meditation. One scientist asked one of the\nmonks whether he ever stops meditating because his knees hurt from all\nthat cross-leggedness. He answered, “Sometimes I’ll stop sooner than I\nplanned, but not because it hurts; it’s not something I notice. It’s as an act\nof kindness to my knees.” “Whoa,” I thought, “these guys are from\nanother planet.” A cool, commendable one, but another planet\nnonetheless. Crimes of passion and good acts of passion make the most\nsense to us (nevertheless, as we shall see, dispassionate kindness often\nhas much to recommend it).\nHot-blooded badness, warmhearted goodness, and the unnerving\nincongruity of the cold-blooded versions raise a key point, encapsulated\nin a quote from Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and\nconcentration camp survivor: “The opposite of love is not hate; its\nopposite is indifference.” The biologies of strong love and strong hate\nare similar in many ways, as we’ll see.\nWhich reminds us that we don’t hate aggression; we hate the wrong\nkind of aggression but love it in the right context. And conversely, in the\nwrong context our most laudable behaviors are anything but. The\nmotoric features of our behaviors are less important and challenging to\nunderstand than the meaning behind our muscles’ actions.\nThis is shown in a subtle study.7 Subjects in a brain scanner entered a\nvirtual room where they encountered either an injured person in need of\nhelp or a menacing extraterrestrial; subjects could either bandage or\nshoot the individual. Pulling a trigger and applying a bandage are\ndifferent behaviors. But they are similar, insofar as bandaging the injured\nperson and shooting the alien are both the “right” things. And\ncontemplating those two different versions of doing the right thing\nactivated the same circuitry in the most context-savvy part of the brain,\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nAnd thus those key terms that anchor this book are most difficult to\ndefine because of their profound context dependency. I will therefore\ngroup them in a way that reflects this. I won’t frame the behaviors to\n24\nand frothy. Instead, as our convenient shorthand for concepts that truly\ndefy brevity, this book is about the biology of our best and worst\nbehaviors."

    "content": "One Second Before\narious muscles have moved, and a behavior has happened.\nPerhaps it is a good act: you’ve empathically touched the arm of\na suffering person. Perhaps it is a foul act: you’ve pulled a trigger,\ntargeting an innocent person. Perhaps it is a good act: you’ve pulled a\ntrigger, drawing fire to save others. Perhaps it is a foul act: you’ve\ntouched the arm of someone, starting a chain of libidinal events that\nbetray a loved one. Acts that, as emphasized, are definable only by\ncontext.\nThus, to ask the question that will begin this and the next eight\nchapters, why did that behavior occur?\nAs this book’s starting point, we know that different disciplines\nproduce different answers—because of some hormone; because of\nevolution; because of childhood experiences or genes or culture—and as\nthe book’s central premise, these are utterly intertwined answers, none\nstanding alone. But on the most proximal level, in this chapter we ask:\nWhat happened one second before the behavior that caused it to occur?\nThis puts us in the realm of neurobiology, of understanding the brain that\ncommanded those muscles.\nThis chapter is one of the book’s anchors. The brain is the final\ncommon pathway, the conduit that mediates the influences of all the\ndistal factors to be covered in the chapters to come. What happened an\nhour, a decade, a million years earlier? What happened were factors that\nimpacted the brain and the behavior it produced.\nThis chapter has two major challenges. The first is its god-awful\nlength. Apologies; I’ve tried to be succinct and nontechnical, but this is\n26\nwith no background in neuroscience. To help with that, please wade\nthrough appendix 1 around now.\n—\nNow we ask: What crucial things happened in the second before that pro-\nor antisocial behavior occurred? Or, translated into neurobiology: What\nwas going on with action potentials, neurotransmitters, and neural\ncircuits in particular brain regions during that second?\n\nLITERAL) LAYERS\ne start by considering the brain’s macroorganization, using a\nmodel proposed in the 1960s by the neuroscientist Paul\nMacLean.1 His “triune brain” model conceptualizes the brain as having\nthree functional domains:\nLayer 1: An ancient part of the brain, at its base, found in species from\nhumans to geckos. This layer mediates automatic, regulatory functions.\nIf body temperature drops, this brain region senses it and commands\nmuscles to shiver. If blood glucose levels plummet, that’s sensed here,\ngenerating hunger. If an injury occurs, a different loop initiates a stress\nresponse.\nLayer 2: A more recently evolved region that has expanded in\nmammals. MacLean conceptualized this layer as being about emotions,\nsomewhat of a mammalian invention. If you see something gruesome\nand terrifying, this layer sends commands down to ancient layer 1,\nmaking you shiver with emotion. If you’re feeling sadly unloved, regions\nhere prompt layer 1 to generate a craving for comfort food. If you’re a\nrodent and smell a cat, neurons here cause layer 1 to initiate a stress\nresponse.\nLayer 3: The recently evolved layer of neocortex sitting on the upper\nsurface of the brain. Proportionately, primates devote more of their brain\nto this layer than do other species. Cognition, memory storage, sensory\nprocessing, abstractions, philosophy, navel contemplation. Read a scary\npassage of a book, and layer 3 signals layer 2 to make you feel\nfrightened, prompting layer 1 to initiate shivering. See an ad for Oreos\nand feel a craving—layer 3 influences layers 2 and 1. Contemplate the\nfact that loved ones won’t live forever, or kids in refugee camps, or how\nthe Na’vis’ home tree was destroyed by those jerk humans in Avatar\n(despite the fact that, wait, Na’vi aren’t real!), and layer 3 pulls layers 2\nbiggest disadvantage is how simplistic this is. For example:\na. Anatomically there is considerable overlap among the\nthree layers (for example, one part of the cortex can best\nbe thought of as part of layer 2; stay tuned).\nb. The flow of information and commands is not just top\ndown, from layer 3 to 2 to 1. A weird, great example\nexplored in chapter 15: if someone is holding a cold\ndrink (temperature is processed in layer 1), they’re more\nlikely to judge someone they meet as having a cold\npersonality (layer 3).\nc. Automatic aspects of behavior (simplistically, the\npurview of layer 1), emotion (layer 2), and thought\n(layer 3) are not separable.\nd. The triune model leads one, erroneously, to think that\nevolution in effect slapped on each new layer without\nany changes occurring in the one(s) already there.\no make sense of our best and worst behaviors, automaticity,\nemotion, and cognition must all be considered; I arbitrarily start\nwith layer 2 and its emphasis on emotion.\nEarly-twentieth-century neuroscientists thought it obvious what layer\n2 did. Take your standard-issue lab animal, a rat, and examine its brain.\nRight at the front would be these two gigantic lobes, the “olfactory\nbulbs” (one for each nostril), the primary receptive area for odors.\nNeuroscientists at the time asked what parts of the brain these\ngigantic rodent olfactory bulbs talked to (i.e., where they sent their\naxonal projections). Which brain regions were only a single synapse\naway from receiving olfactory information, which were two synapses,\nthree, and so on?\nAnd it was layer 2 structures that received the first communiqués.\nAh, everyone concluded, this part of the brain must process odors, and so\nit was termed the rhinencephalon—the nose brain.\nMeanwhile, in the thirties and forties, neuroscientists such as the\nyoung MacLean, James Papez, Paul Bucy, and Heinrich Klüver were\nstarting to figure out what the layer 2 structures did. For example, if you\nRhinencephalon or limbic system? Olfaction or emotion? Pitched\nstreet battles ensued until someone pointed out the obvious—for a rat,\nemotion and olfaction are nearly synonymous, since nearly all the\nenvironmental stimuli that elicit emotions in a rodent are olfactory. Peace\nin our time. In a rodent, olfactory inputs are what the limbic system most\ndepends on for emotional news of the world. In contrast, the primate\nlimbic system is more informed by visual inputs.\nLimbic function is now recognized as central to the emotions that\nfuel our best and worst behaviors, and extensive research has uncovered\nthe functions of its structures (e.g., the amygdala, hippocampus, septum,\nhabenula, and mammillary bodies).\nThere really aren’t “centers” in the brain “for” particular behaviors.\nThis is particularly the case with the limbic system and emotion. There is\nindeed a sub-subregion of the motor cortex that approximates being the\n“center” for making your left pinkie bend; other regions have “center”-\nish roles in regulating breathing or body temperature. But there sure\naren’t centers for feeling pissy or horny, for feeling bittersweet nostalgia\nor warm protectiveness tinged with contempt, or for that what-is-that-\nthing-called-love feeling. No surprise, then, that the circuitry connecting\nvarious limbic structures is immensely complex.\nThe Autonomic Nervous System and the Ancient\nCore Regions of the Brain\nThe limbic system’s regions form complex circuits of excitation and\ninhibition. It’s easier to understand this by appreciating the deeply held\ndesire of every limbic structure—to influence what the hypothalamus\ndoes.\nWhy? Because of its importance. The hypothalamus, a limbic\nstructure, is the interface between layers 1 and 2, between core\nregulatory and emotional parts of the brain.\nConsistent with that, the hypothalamus gets massive inputs from\nlimbic layer 2 structures but disproportionately sends projections to layer\nsend signals up the spine to layer 1 regions, resulting in signals back\ndown the spine that increase heart rate and blood pressure; the result is\nmore oxygen and glucose for the muscles. Gorge on food, and stomach\nwalls distend; neurons embedded there sense this and pass on the news,\nand soon blood vessels in the gut dilate, increasing blood flow and\nfacilitating digestion. Too warm? Blood is sent to the body’s surface to\ndissipate heat.\n—\nAll of this is automatic, or “autonomic.” And thus the midbrain and\nbrain-stem regions, along with their projections down the spine and out\nto the body, are collectively termed the “autonomic nervous system.”*\nAnd where does the hypothalamus come in? It’s the means by which\nthe limbic system influences autonomic function, how layer 2 talks to\nlayer 1. Have a full bladder with its muscle walls distended, and\nmidbrain/brain-stem circuitry votes for urinating. Be exposed to\nsomething sufficiently terrifying, and limbic structures, via the\nhypothalamus, persuade the midbrain and brain stem to do the same.\nThis is how emotions change bodily functions, why limbic roads\neventually lead to the hypothalamus.*\nThe autonomic nervous system has two parts—the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous systems, with fairly opposite functions.\nThe sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates the body’s response\nto arousing circumstances, for example, producing the famed “fight or\nflight” stress response. To use the feeble joke told to first-year medical\nstudents, the SNS mediates the “four Fs—fear, fight, flight, and sex.”\nParticular midbrain/brain-stem nuclei send long SNS projections down\nthe spine and on to outposts throughout the body, where the axon\nterminals release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. There’s one\nexception that makes the SNS more familiar. In the adrenal gland,\ninstead of norepinephrine (aka noradrenaline) being released, it’s\nepinephrine (aka the famous adrenaline).*\nMeanwhile, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) arises from\ndifferent midbrain/brain-stem nuclei that project down the spine to the\nwaste energy digesting breakfast).* And as we will see chapter 14, if\nseeing someone in pain activates your SNS, you’re likely to be\npreoccupied with your own distress instead of helping; turn on the PNS,\nand it’s the opposite. Given that the SNS and PNS do opposite things, the\nPNS is obviously going to be releasing a different neurotransmitter from\nits axon terminals—acetylcholine.*\nThere is a second, equally important way in which emotion\ninfluences the body. Specifically, the hypothalamus also regulates the\nrelease of many hormones; this is covered in chapter 4.\n—\nSo the limbic system indirectly regulates autonomic function and\nhormone release. What does this have to do with behavior? Plenty—\nbecause the autonomic and hormonal states of the body feed back to the\nbrain, influencing behavior (typically unconsciously).* Stay tuned for\nmore in chapters 3 and 4.\nThe Interface Between the Limbic System and the\nCortex\nTime to add the cortex. As noted, this is the brain’s upper surface (its\nname comes from the Latin cortic, meaning “tree bark”) and is the\nnewest part of the brain.\nThe cortex is the gleaming, logical, analytical crown jewel of layer 3.\nMost sensory information flows there to be decoded. It’s where muscles\nare commanded to move, where language is comprehended and\nproduced, where memories are stored, where spatial and mathematical\nskills reside, where executive decisions are made. It floats above the\nlimbic system, supporting philosophers since at least Descartes who have\nemphasized the dichotomy between thought and emotion.\nOf course, that’s all wrong, as shown by the temperature of a cup—\nsomething processed in the hypothalamus—altering assessment of the\ncoldness of someone’s personality. Emotions filter the nature and\nof axonal projections course between the two. Crucially, those\nprojections are bidirectional—the limbic system talks to the cortex,\nrather than merely being reined in by it. The false dichotomy between\nthought and feeling is presented in the classic Descartes’ Error, by the\nneurologist Antonio Damasio of the University of Southern California;\nhis work is discussed later.2\nWhile the hypothalamus dwells at the interface of layers 1 and 2, it is\nthe incredibly interesting frontal cortex that is the interface between\nlayers 2 and 3.\nKey insight into the frontal cortex was provided in the 1960s by a\ngiant of neuroscience, Walle Nauta of MIT.*3 Nauta studied what brain\nregions sent axons to the frontal cortex and what regions got axons from\nit. And the frontal cortex was bidirectionally enmeshed with the limbic\nsystem, leading him to propose that the frontal cortex is a quasi member\nof the limbic system. Naturally, everyone thought him daft. The frontal\ncortex was the most recently evolved part of the very highbrow cortex—\nthe only reason why the frontal cortex would ever go slumming into the\nlimbic system would be to preach honest labor and Christian temperance\nto the urchins there.\nNaturally, Nauta was right. In different circumstances the frontal\ncortex and limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other, collaborate and\ncoordinate, or bicker and work at cross-purposes. It really is an honorary\nmember of the limbic system. And the interactions between the frontal\ncortex and (other) limbic structures are at the core of much of this book.\nTwo more details. First, the cortex is not a smooth surface but instead\nis folded into convolutions. The convolutions form a superstructure of\n34\nBrain Lateralization\n\nthought\nDetail-\noriented\nperception\nOrdered\nsequencing\nRational\nthought\nVerbal\nCautious\nPlanning\nMath/science\nLogic\nRight-field\nvision\nRight-side\nmotor skills\nIntuitive\nthought\nHolistic\nperception\nRandom\nsequencing\nEmotional\nthought\nNonverbal\nAdventurous\nImpulse\nCreative\nwriting/art\nImagination\nLeft-field\nvision\nLeft-side\nmotor skills\nSecond, brains obviously have left and right sides, or “hemispheres,”\nthat roughly mirror each other.\nThus, except for the relatively few midline structures, brain regions\ncome in pairs (a left and right amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe,\nand so on). Functions are often lateralized, such that the left and right\nhippocampi, for example, have different but related functions. The\ngreatest lateralization occurs in the cortex; the left hemisphere is\nanalytical, the right more involved in intuition and creativity. These\ncontrasts have caught the public fancy, with cortical lateralization\nexaggerated by many to an absurd extent, where “left brain”–edness has\nthe connotation of anal-retentive bean counting and “right brain”–edness\nis about making mandalas or singing with whales. In fact the functional\ndifferences between the hemispheres are generally subtle, and I’m\nmostly ignoring lateralization.\nWe’re now ready to examine the brain regions most central to this\n36\nplayer regions will be subsumed under the headings for these three). We\nstart with the one arguably most central to our worst behaviors.\n\nhe amygdala* is the archetypal limbic structure, sitting under the\ncortex in the temporal lobe. It is central to mediating aggression,\nalong with other behaviors that tell us tons about aggression.\nA First Pass at the Amygdala and Aggression\nThe evidence for the amygdala’s role in aggression is extensive,\nbased on research approaches that will become familiar.\nFirst there’s the correlative “recording” approach. Stick recording\nelectrodes into numerous species’ amygdalae* and see when neurons\nthere have action potentials; this turns out to be when the animal is being\naggressive.* In a related approach, determine which brain regions\nconsume extra oxygen or glucose, or synthesize certain activity-related\nproteins, during aggression—the amygdala tops the list.\nMoving beyond mere correlation, if you lesion the amygdala in an\nanimal, rates of aggression decline. The same occurs transiently when\nyou temporarily silence the amygdala by injecting Novocain into it.\nConversely, implanting electrodes that stimulate neurons there, or\nspritzing in excitatory neurotransmitters (stay tuned), triggers\naggression.4\nShow human subjects pictures that provoke anger, and the amygdala\nactivates (as shown with neuroimaging). Sticking an electrode in\nsomeone’s amygdala and stimulating it (as is done before certain types of\nneurosurgery) produces rage.\nThe most convincing data concern rare humans with damage\nrestricted to the amygdala, either due to a type of encephalitis or a\ncongenital disorder called Urbach-Wiethe disease, or where the\namygdala was surgically destroyed to control severe, drug-resistant\nseizures originating there.5 Such individuals are impaired in detecting\nseizures but to control aggression. Such psychosurgery provoked fiery\ncontroversy in the 1970s. And I don’t mean scientists not saying hello to\neach other at conferences. I mean a major public shit storm.\nThe issue raised bioethical lightning rods: What counted as\npathological aggression? Who decided? What other interventions had\nbeen tried unsuccessfully? Were some types of hyperaggressive\nindividuals more likely to go under the knife than others? What\nconstituted a cure?6\nMost of these cases concerned rare epileptics where seizure onset\nwas associated with uncontrollable aggression, and where the goal was\nto contain that behavior (these papers had titles such as “Clinical and\nphysiological effects of stereotaxic bilateral amygdalotomy for\nintractable aggression”). The fecal hurricane concerned the involuntary\nlopping out of the amygdala in people without epilepsy but with a history\nof severe aggression. Well, doing this could be profoundly helpful. Or\nOrwellian. This is a long, dark story and I will save it for another time.\nDid destruction of the human amygdala lessen aggression? Pretty\nclearly so, when violence was a reflexive, inchoate outburst preceding a\nseizure. But with surgery done solely to control behavior, the answer is,\ner, maybe—the heterogeneity of patients and surgical approaches, the\nlack of modern neuroimaging to pinpoint exactly which parts of the\namygdala were destroyed in each individual, and the imprecision in the\nbehavioral data (with papers reporting from 33 to 100 percent “success”\nrates) make things inconclusive. The procedure has almost entirely fallen\nout of practice.\nThe amygdala/aggression link pops up in two notorious cases of\nviolence. The first concerns Ulrike Meinhof, a founder in 1968 of the\nRed Army Faction (aka the Baader-Meinhof Gang), a terrorist group\nresponsible for bombings and bank robberies in West Germany. Meinhof\nhad a conventional earlier life as a journalist before becoming violently\nradicalized. During her 1976 murder trial, she was found hanged in her\njail cell (suicide or murder? still unclear). In 1962 Meinhof had had a\nbenign brain tumor surgically removed; the 1976 autopsy showed that\nthe University of Texas in Austin, killing sixteen and wounding thirty-\ntwo, one of the first school massacres. Whitman was literally an Eagle\nScout and childhood choirboy, a happily married engineering major with\nan IQ in the 99th percentile. In the prior year he had seen doctors,\ncomplaining of severe headaches and violent impulses (e.g., to shoot\npeople from the campus tower). He left notes by the bodies of his wife\nand his mother, proclaiming love and puzzlement at his actions: “I\ncannot rationaly [sic] pinpoint any specific reason for [killing her],” and\n“let there be no doubt in your mind that I loved this woman with all my\nheart.” His suicide note requested an autopsy of his brain, and that any\nmoney he had be given to a mental health foundation. The autopsy\nproved his intuition correct—Whitman had a glioblastoma tumor\npressing on his amygdala. Did Whitman’s tumor “cause” his violence?\nProbably not in a strict “amygdaloid tumor = murderer” sense, as he had\nrisk factors that interacted with his neurological issues. Whitman grew\nup being beaten by his father and watching his mother and siblings\nexperience the same. This choirboy Eagle Scout had repeatedly\nphysically abused his wife and had been court-martialed as a Marine for\nphysically threatening another soldier.* And, perhaps indicative of a\nthread running through the family, his brother was murdered at age\ntwenty-four during a bar fight.8\nA Whole Other Domain of Amygdaloid Function\nto the Center Stage\nThus considerable evidence implicates the amygdala in aggression.\nBut if you asked amygdala experts what behavior their favorite brain\nstructure brings to mind, “aggression” wouldn’t top their list. It would be\nfear and anxiety.9 Crucially, the brain region most involved in feeling\nafraid and anxious is most involved in generating aggression.\nThe amygdala/fear link is based on evidence similar to that\nsupporting the amygdala/aggression link.10 In lab animals this has\ninvolved lesioning the structure, detecting activity in its neurons with\nsigns of fear.\nIn one study subjects in a brain scanner played a Ms. Pac-Man–\nfrom–hell video game where they were pursued in a maze by a dot; if\ncaught, they’d be shocked.11 When people were evading the dot, the\namygdala was silent. However, its activity increased as the dot\napproached; the stronger the shocks, the farther away the dot would be\nwhen first activating the amygdala, the stronger the activation, and the\nlarger the self-reported feeling of panic.\nIn another study subjects waited an unknown length of time to\nreceive a shock.12 This lack of predictability and control was so aversive\nthat many chose to receive a stronger shock immediately. And in the\nothers the period of anticipatory dread increasingly activated the\namygdala.\nThus the human amygdala preferentially responds to fear-evoking\nstimuli, even stimuli so fleeting as to be below conscious detection.\nPowerful support for an amygdaloid role in fear processing comes\nfrom post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In PTSD sufferers the\namygdala is overreactive to mildly fearful stimuli and is slow in calming\ndown after being activated.13 Moreover, the amygdala expands in size\nwith long-term PTSD. This role of stress in this expansion will be\ncovered in chapter 4.\nThe amygdala is also involved in the expression of anxiety.14 Take a\ndeck of cards—half are black, half are red; how much would you wager\nthat the top card is red? That’s about risk. Here’s a deck of cards—at\nleast one is black, at least one is red; how much would you wager that\nthe top card is red? That’s about ambiguity. The circumstances carry\nidentical probabilities, but people are made more anxious by the second\nscenario and activate the amygdala more. The amygdala is particularly\nsensitive to unsettling circumstances that are social. A high-ranking male\nrhesus monkey is in a sexual consortship with a female; in one condition\nthe female is placed in another room, where the male can see her. In the\nsecond she’s in the other room along with a rival of the male. No\nsurprise, that situation activates the amygdala. Is that about aggression or\nThe amygdala is linked to social uncertainty in other ways. In one\nneuroimaging study, a subject would participate in a competitive game\nagainst a group of other players; outcomes were rigged so that the\nsubject would wind up in the middle of the rankings.15 Experimenters\nthen manipulated game outcomes so that subjects’ rankings either\nremained stable or fluctuated wildly. Stable rankings activated parts of\nthe frontal cortex that we’ll soon consider. Instability activated the\nfrontal cortex plus the amygdala. Being unsure of your place is\nunsettling.\nAnother study explored the neurobiology of conforming.16 To\nsimplify, a subject is part of a group (where, secretly, the rest are\nconfederates); they are shown “X,” then asked, “What did you see?”\nEveryone else says “Y.” Does the subject lie and say “Y” also? Often.\nSubjects who stuck to their guns with “X” showed amygdala activation.\nFinally, activating specific circuits within the amygdala in mice turns\nanxiety on and off; activating others made mice unable to distinguish\nbetween safe and anxiety-producing settings.*17\nThe amygdala also helps mediate both innate and learned fear.18 The\ncore of innate fear (aka a phobia) is that you don’t have to learn by trial\nand error that something is aversive. For example, a rat born in a lab,\nwho has interacted only with other rats and grad students, instinctually\nfears and avoids the smell of cats. While different phobias activate\nsomewhat different brain circuitry (for example, dentist phobia involves\nthe cortex more than does snake phobia), they all activate the amygdala.\nSuch innate fear contrasts with things we learn to fear—a bad\nneighborhood, a letter from the IRS. The dichotomy between innate and\nlearned fear is actually a bit fuzzy.19 Everyone knows that humans are\ninnately afraid of snakes and spiders. But some people keep them as pets,\ngive them cute names.* Instead of inevitable fear, we show “prepared\nlearning”—learning to be afraid of snakes and spiders more readily than\nof pandas or beagles.\nThe same occurs in other primates. For example, lab monkeys who\nhave never encountered snakes (or artificial flowers) can be conditioned\nto fear the former more readily than the latter. As we’ll see in the next\namygdala plays a key role in innate fears. Surrounding it is the\nbasolateral amygdala (BLA), which is more recently evolved and\nsomewhat resembles the fancy, modern cortex. It’s the BLA that learns\nfear and then sends the news to the central amygdala.\nJoseph LeDoux at New York University has shown how the BLA\nlearns fear.*20 Expose a rat to an innate trigger of fear—a shock. When\nthis “unconditioned stimulus” occurs, the central amygdala activates,\nstress hormones are secreted, the sympathetic nervous system mobilizes,\nand, as a clear end point, the rat freezes in place—“What was that? What\ndo I do?” Now do some conditioning. Before each shock, expose the rat\nto a stimulus that normally does not evoke fear, such as a tone. And with\nrepeated coupling of the tone (the conditioned stimulus) with the shock\n(the unconditioned one), fear conditioning occurs—the sound of the tone\nalone elicits freezing, stress hormone release, and so on.*\nLeDoux and others have shown how auditory information about the\ntone stimulates BLA neurons. At first, activation of those neurons is\nirrelevant to the central amygdala (whose neurons are destined to\nactivate following the shock). But with repeated coupling of tone with\nshock, there is remapping and those BLA neurons acquire the means to\nactivate the central amygdala.*\nBLA neurons that respond to the tone only once conditioning has\noccurred would also have responded if conditioning instead had been to\na light. In other words, these neurons respond to the meaning of the\nstimulus, rather than to its specific modality. Moreover, if you\nelectrically stimulate them, rats are easier to fear-condition; you’ve\nlowered the threshold for this association to be made. And if you\nelectrically stimulate the auditory sensory input at the same time as\nshocks (i.e., there’s no tone, just activation of the pathway that normally\ncarries news of the tone to the amygdala), you cause fear conditioning to\na tone. You’ve engineered the learning of a false fear.\nThere are synaptic changes as well. Once conditioning to a tone has\noccurred, the synapses coupling the BLA and central nucleus neurons\nhave become more excitable; how this occurs is understood at the level\nof changes in the amount of receptors for excitatory neurotransmitters in\nWe’ve now got learning to be afraid under our belts.*21 Now\nconditions change—the tone still occurs now and then, but no more\nshock. Gradually the conditioned fear response abates. How does “fear\nextinction” occur? How do we learn that this person wasn’t so scary after\nall, that different doesn’t necessarily equal frightening? Recall how a\nsubset of BLA neurons respond to the tone only once conditioning has\noccurred. Another population does the opposite, responding to the tone\nonce it’s no longer signaling shock (logically, the two populations of\nneurons inhibit each other). Where do these “Ohhh, the tone isn’t scary\nanymore” neurons get inputs from? The frontal cortex. When we stop\nfearing something, it isn’t because some amygdaloid neurons have lost\ntheir excitability. We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We\nactively learn that it isn’t anymore.*\nThe amygdala also plays a logical role in social and emotional\ndecision making. In the Ultimatum Game, an economic game involving\ntwo players, the first makes an offer as to how to divide a pot of money,\nwhich the other player either accepts or rejects.22 If the latter, neither\ngets anything. Research shows that rejecting an offer is an emotional\ndecision, triggered by anger at a lousy offer and the desire to punish. The\nmore the amygdala activation in the second player after an offer, the\nmore likely the rejection. People with damaged amygdalae are atypically\ngenerous in the Ultimatum Game and don’t increase rejection rates if\nthey start receiving unfair offers.\nWhy? These individuals understand the rules and can give sound,\nstrategic advice to other players. Moreover, they use the same strategies\nas control subjects in a nonsocial version of the game, when believing\nthe other player is a computer. And they don’t have a particularly long\nview, undistracted by the amygdala’s emotional tumult, reasoning that\ntheir noncontingent generosity will induce reciprocity and pay off in the\nlong run. When asked, they anticipate the same levels of reciprocity as\ndo controls.\nInstead, these findings suggest that the amygdala injects implicit\ndistrust and vigilance into social decision making.23 All thanks to\nlearning. In the words of the authors of the study, “The generosity in the\namygdala does is learn vigilance and distrust.\nUnexpectedly, the amygdala and one of its hypothalamic targets also\nplay a role in male sexual motivation (other hypothalamic nuclei are\ncentral to male sexual performance)* but not female.* What’s that\nabout? One neuroimaging study sheds some light. “Young heterosexual\nmen” looked at pictures of attractive women (versus, as a control, of\nattractive men). Passively observing the pictures activated the reward\ncircuitry just alluded to. In contrast, working to see the pictures—by\nrepeatedly pressing a button—also activated the amygdala. Similarly,\nother studies show that the amygdala is most responsive to positive\nstimuli when the value of the reward is shifting. Moreover, some BLA\nneurons that respond in that circumstance also respond when the severity\nof something aversive is shifting—these neurons are paying attention to\nchange, independent of direction. For them, “the amount of reward is\nchanging” and “the amount of punishment is changing” are the same.\nStudies like these clarify that the amygdala isn’t about the pleasure of\nexperiencing pleasure. It’s about the uncertain, unsettled yearning for a\npotential pleasure, the anxiety and fear and anger that the reward may be\nsmaller than anticipated, or may not even happen. It’s about how many\nof our pleasures and our pursuits of them contain a corrosive vein of\ndisease.*24\nThe Amygdala as Part of Networks in the Brain\nNow that we know about the subparts of the amygdala, it’s\ninformative to consider its extrinsic connections—i.e., what parts of the\nbrain send projection to it, and what parts does it project to?25\nSOME INPUTS TO THE AMYGDALA\nSensory inputs. For starters, the amygdala, specifically the BLA, gets\nprojections from all the sensory systems.26 How else can you get\nterrified by the shark’s theme music in Jaws? Normally, sensory\ninformation from various modalities (eyes, ears, skin . . .) courses into\nthe brain, reaching the appropriate cortical region (visual cortex, auditory\nthe brain takes a shortcut, bypassing the cortex and going directly to the\namygdala. Thus the amygdala can be informed about something scary\nbefore the cortex has a clue. Moreover, thanks to the extreme excitability\nof this pathway, the amygdala can respond to stimuli that are too fleeting\nor faint for the cortex to note. Additionally, the shortcut projections form\nstronger, more excitable synapses in the BLA than do the ones from the\nsensory cortex; emotional arousal enhances fear conditioning through\nthis pathway. This shortcut’s power is shown in the case of a man with\nstroke damage to his visual cortex, producing “cortical blindness.” While\nunable to process most visual information, he still recognized emotional\nfacial expressions via the shortcut.*\nCrucially, while sensory information reaches the amygdala rapidly by\nthis shortcut, it isn’t terribly accurate (since, after all, accuracy is what\nthe cortex supplies). As we’ll see in the next chapter, this produces tragic\ncircumstances where, say, the amygdala decides it’s seeing a handgun\nbefore the visual cortex can report that it’s actually a cell phone.\nInformation about pain. The amygdala receives news of that reliable\ntrigger of fear and aggression, namely pain.27 This is mediated by\nprojections from an ancient, core brain structure, the “periaqueductal\ngray” (PAG); stimulation of the PAG can evoke panic attacks, and it is\nenlarged in people with chronic panic attacks. Reflecting the amygdala’s\nroles in vigilance, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear, it’s unpredictable pain,\nrather than pain itself, that activates the amygdala. Pain (and the\namygdala’s response to it) is all about context.\nDisgust of all stripes. The amygdala also receives a hugely interesting\nprojection from the “insular cortex,” an honorary part of the prefrontal\ncortex, which we will consider at length in later chapters.28 If you (or\nany other mammal) bite into rancid food, the insular cortex lights up,\ncausing you to spit it out, gag, feel nauseated, make a revolted facial\nexpression—the insular cortex processes gustatory disgust. Ditto for\ndisgusting smells.\nRemarkably, humans also activate it by thinking about something\nmorally disgusting—social norm violations or individuals who are\ntypically stigmatized in society. And in that circumstance its activation\na computer that has stabbed you in the back.\nThe insula activates when we eat a cockroach or imagine doing so.\nAnd the insula and amygdala activate when we think of the neighboring\ntribe as loathsome cockroaches. As we’ll see, this is central to how our\nbrains process “us and them.”\nAnd finally, the amygdala gets tons of inputs from the frontal cortex.\nMuch more to come.\nSOME OUTPUTS FROM THE AMYGDALA\nBidirectional connections. As we’ll see, the amygdala talks to many of the\nregions that talk to it, including the frontal cortex, insula, periaqueductal\ngray, and sensory projections, modulating their sensitivity.\nThe amygdala/hippocampus interface. Naturally, the amygdala talks to other\nlimbic structures, including the hippocampus. As reviewed, typically the\namygdala learns fear and the hippocampus learns detached, dispassionate\nfacts. But at times of extreme fear, the amygdala pulls the hippocampus\ninto a type of fear learning.29\nBack to the rat undergoing fear conditioning. When it’s in cage A, a\ntone is followed by a shock. But in cage B, the tone isn’t. This produces\ncontext-dependent conditioning—the tone causes fearful freezing in cage\nA but not in cage B. The amygdala learns the stimulus cue—the tone—\nwhile the hippocampus learns about the contexts of cage A versus B. The\ncoupled learning between amygdala and hippocampus is very focalized\n—we all remember the view of the plane hitting the second World Trade\nCenter tower, but not whether there were clouds in the background. The\nhippocampus decides whether a factoid is worth filing away, depending\non whether the amygdala has gotten worked up over it. Moreover, the\ncoupling can rescale. Suppose someone robs you at gunpoint in an alley\nin a bad part of town. Afterward, depending on the circumstance, the gun\ncan be the cue and the alley the context, or the alley is the cue and the\nbad part of town the context.\nMotor outputs. There’s a second shortcut regarding the amygdala,\nspecifically when it’s talking to motor neurons that command\nmovement.30 Logically, when the amygdala wants to mobilize a behavior\nthe input shortcut may prompt you to see the cell phone as a gun. And\nthe output shortcut may prompt you to pull a trigger before you\nconsciously mean to.\nArousal. Ultimately, amygdala outputs are mostly about setting off\nalarms throughout the brain and body. As we saw, the core of the\namygdala is the central amygdala.31 Axonal projections from there go to\nan amygdala-ish structure nearby called the bed nucleus of the stria\nterminalis (BNST). The BNST, in turn, projects to parts of the\nhypothalamus that initiate the hormonal stress response (see chapter 4),\nas well as to midbrain and brain-stem sites that activate the sympathetic\nnervous system and inhibit the parasympathetic nervous system.\nSomething emotionally arousing occurs, layer 2 limbic amygdala signals\nlayer 1 regions, and heart rate and blood pressure soar.*\nThe amygdala also activates a brain-stem structure called the locus\ncoeruleus, akin to the brain’s own sympathetic nervous system.32 It sends\nnorepinephrine-releasing projections throughout the brain, particularly\nthe cortex. If the locus coeruleus is drowsy and silent, so are you. If it’s\nmoderately activated, you’re alert. And if it’s firing like gangbusters,\nthanks to inputs from an aroused amygdala, all neuronal hands are on\ndeck.\nThe amygdala’s projection pattern raises an important point.33 When\nis the sympathetic nervous system going full blast? During fear, flight,\nfight, and sex. Or if you’ve won the lottery, are happily sprinting down a\nsoccer field, or have just solved Fermat’s theorem (if you’re that kind of\nperson). Reflecting this, about a quarter of neurons in one hypothalamic\nnucleus are involved in both sexual behavior and, when stimulated at a\nhigher intensity, aggressive behavior in male mice.\nThis has two implications. Both sex and aggression activate the\nsympathetic nervous system, which in turn can influence behavior—\npeople feel differently about things if, say, their heart is racing versus\nbeating slowly. Does this mean that the pattern of your autonomic\narousal influences what you feel? Not really. But autonomic feedback\ninfluences the intensity of what is felt. More on this in the next chapter.\n—\nThis concludes our overview of the amygdala. Amid the jargon and\ncomplexity, the most important theme is the amygdala’s dual role in both\naggression and facets of fear and anxiety. Fear and aggression are not\ninevitably intertwined—not all fear causes aggression, and not all\naggression is rooted in fear. Fear typically increases aggression only in\nthose already prone to it; among the subordinate who lack the option of\nexpressing aggression safely, fear does the opposite.\nThe dissociation between fear and aggression is evident in violent\npsychopaths, who are the antithesis of fearful—both physiologically and\nsubjectively they are less reactive to pain; their amygdalae are relatively\nunresponsive to typical fear-evoking stimuli and are smaller than\nnormal.34 This fits with the picture of psychopathic violence; it is not\ndone in aroused reaction to provocation. Instead, it is purely\ninstrumental, using others as a means to an end with emotionless,\nremorseless, reptilian indifference.\nThus, fear and violence are not always connected at the hip. But a\nconnection is likely when the aggression evoked is reactive, frenzied,\nand flecked with spittle. In a world in which no amygdaloid neuron need\nbe afraid and instead can sit under its vine and fig tree, the world is very\nlikely to be a more peaceful place.*\n—\n’ve spent decades studying the hippocampus. It’s been good to me;\nI’d like to think I’ve been the same in return. Yet I think I might have\nmade the wrong choice back then—maybe I should have studied the\nfrontal cortex all these years. Because it’s the most interesting part of the\nbrain.\nWhat does the frontal cortex do? Its list of expertise includes\nworking memory, executive function (organizing knowledge\nstrategically, and then initiating an action based on an executive\ndecision), gratification postponement, long-term planning, regulation of\nemotions, and reining in impulsivity.35\nThis is a sprawling portfolio. I will group these varied functions\nunder a single definition, pertinent to every page of this book: the frontal\ncortex makes you do the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.\nTo start, here are some important features of the frontal cortex:\nIt’s the most recently evolved brain region, not approaching full\nsplendor until the emergence of primates; a disproportionate\npercentage of genes unique to primates are active in the frontal\ncortex. Moreover, such gene expression patterns are highly\nindividuated, with greater interindividual variability than average\nlevels of whole-brain differences between humans and chimps.\nThe human frontal cortex is more complexly wired than in other\napes and, by some definitions as to its boundaries,\nproportionately bigger as well.36\nThe frontal cortex is the last brain region to fully mature, with\nthe most evolutionarily recent subparts the very last. Amazingly,\nit’s not fully online until people are in their midtwenties. You’d\nneurons, neurotransmitters, enzymes, and so on. Human and fly\nneurons are remarkably similar; the uniqueness is quantitative—\nfor every fly neuron, we have a gazillion more neurons and a\nbazillion more connections.37\nThe sole exception is an obscure type of neuron with a distinctive\nshape and pattern of wiring, called von Economo neurons (aka spindle\nneurons). At first they seemed to be unique to humans, but we’ve now\nfound them in other primates, whales, dolphins, and elephants.* That’s\nan all-star team of socially complex species.\nMoreover, the few von Economo neurons occur only in two\nsubregions of the frontal cortex, as shown by John Allman at Caltech.\nOne we’ve heard about already—the insula, with its role in gustatory and\nmoral disgust. The second is an equally interesting area called the\nanterior cingulate. To give a hint (with more to come), it’s central to\nempathy.\nSo from the standpoint of evolution, size, complexity, development,\ngenetics, and neuron type, the frontal cortex is distinctive, with the\nhuman version the most unique.\nThe Subregions of the Frontal Cortex\nFrontal cortical anatomy is hellishly complicated, and there are\ndebates as to whether some parts of the primate frontal cortex even exist\nin “simpler” species. Nonetheless, there are some useful broad themes.\nIn the very front is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the newest part of the\nfrontal cortex. As noted, the frontal cortex is central to executive\nfunction. To quote George W. Bush, within the frontal cortex, it’s the\nPFC that is “the decider.” Most broadly, the PFC chooses between\nconflicting options—Coke or Pepsi; blurting out what you really think or\nrestraining yourself; pulling the trigger or not. And often the conflict\nbeing resolved is between a decision heavily driven by cognition and one\ndriven by emotions.\nBefore considering how the frontal cortex influences social behavior,\nlet’s start with a simpler domain of its function.\nThe Frontal Cortex and Cognition\nWhat does “doing the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do”\nlook like in the realm of cognition (defined by Princeton’s Jonathan\nCohen as “the ability to orchestrate thought and action in accordance\nwith internal goals”)?38 Suppose you’ve looked up a phone number in a\ncity where you once lived. The frontal cortex not only remembers it long\nenough to dial but also considers it strategically. Just before dialing, you\nconsciously recall that it is in that other city and retrieve your memory of\nthe city’s area code. And then you remember to dial “1” before the area\ncode.*\nThe frontal cortex is also concerned with focusing on a task. If you\nstep off the curb planning to jaywalk, you look at traffic, paying attention\nto motion, calculating whether you can cross safely. If you step off\nlooking for a taxi, you pay attention to whether a car has one of those lit\ntaxicab thingies on top. In a great study, monkeys were trained to look at\na screen of dots of various colors moving in particular directions;\ndepending on a signal, a monkey had to pay attention to either color or\nmovement. Each signal indicating a shift in tasks triggered a burst of\nPFC activity and, coupled with that, suppression of the stream of\ninformation (color or movement) that was now irrelevant. This is the\nPFC getting you to do the harder thing; remembering that the rule has\nchanged, don’t do the previous habitual response.39\nThe frontal cortex also mediates “executive function”—considering\nbits of information, looking for patterns, and then choosing a strategic\naction.40 Consider this truly frontally demanding test. The experimenter\ntells a masochistic volunteer, “I’m going to the market and I’m going to\nbuy peaches, cornflakes, laundry detergent, cinnamon . . .” Sixteen items\nrecited, the volunteer is asked to repeat the list. Maybe they correctly\nThis is more than a simple memory test. With repetition, subjects\nnotice that four of the items are fruits, four for cleaning, four spices, four\ncarbs. They come in categories. And this changes subjects’ encoding\nstrategy as they start clumping by semantic group—“Peaches. Apples.\nBlueberries—no, I mean blackberries. There was another fruit, can’t\nremember what. Okay, cornflakes, bread, doughnuts, muffins. Cumin,\nnutmeg—argh, again!—I mean cinnamon, oregano . . .” And throughout,\nthe PFC imposes an overarching executive strategy for remembering\nthese sixteen factoids.*\nThe PFC is essential for categorical thinking, for organizing and\nthinking about bits of information with different labels. The PFC groups\napples and peaches as closer to each other in a conceptual map than are\napples and toilet plungers. In a relevant study, monkeys were trained to\ndifferentiate between pictures of a dog and of a cat. The PFC contained\nindividual neurons that responded to “dog” and others that responded to\n“cat.” Now the scientists morphed the pictures together, creating hybrids\nwith varying percentages of dog and cat. “Dog” PFC neurons responded\nabout as much to hybrids that were 80 percent dog and 20 percent cat, or\n60:40, as to 100 percent dog. But not to 40:60—“cat” neurons would\nkick in there.41\nThe frontal cortex aids the underdog outcome, fueled by thoughts\nsupplied from influences that fill the rest of this book—stop, those aren’t\nyour cookies; you’ll go to hell; self-discipline is good; you’re happier\nwhen you’re thinner—all giving some lone inhibitory motor neuron\nmore of a fighting chance.\nFrontal Metabolism and an Implicit Vulnerability\nThis raises an important point, pertinent to the social as well as\ncognitive functions of the frontal cortex.42 All this “I wouldn’t do that if\nI were you”–ing by the frontal cortex is taxing. Other brain regions\nrespond to instances of some contingency; the frontal cortex tracks rules.\nMoreover, the frontal mantra of “self-discipline is good” when\ncookies beckon is also invoked when economizing to increase retirement\nsavings. Frontal cortical neurons are generalists, with broad patterns of\nprojections, which makes for more work.43\nAll this takes energy, and when it is working hard, the frontal cortex\nhas an extremely high metabolic rate and rates of activation of genes\nrelated to energy production.44 Willpower is more than just a metaphor;\nself-control is a finite resource. Frontal neurons are expensive cells, and\nexpensive cells are vulnerable cells. Consistent with that, the frontal\ncortex is atypically vulnerable to various neurological insults.\nPertinent to this is the concept of “cognitive load.” Make the frontal\ncortex work hard—a tough working-memory task, regulating social\nbehavior, or making numerous decisions while shopping. Immediately\nafterward performance on a different frontally dependent task declines.45\nLikewise during multitasking, where PFC neurons simultaneously\nparticipate in multiple activated circuits.\nImportantly, increase cognitive load on the frontal cortex, and\nafterward subjects become less prosocial*—less charitable or helpful,\nmore likely to lie.46 Or increase cognitive load with a task requiring\ndifficult emotional regulation, and subjects cheat more on their diets\nafterward.*47\nSo the frontal cortex is awash in Calvinist self-discipline, a superego\nwith its nose to the grindstone.48 But as an important qualifier, soon after\nwe’re potty-trained, doing the harder thing with our bladder muscles\nbecomes automatic. Likewise with other initially demanding frontal\ntasks. For example, you’re learning a piece of music on the piano, there’s\na difficult trill, and each time as you approach it, you think, “Here it\ncomes. Remember, tuck my elbow in, lead with my thumb.” A classic\nworking-memory task. And then one day you realize that you’re five\nmeasures past the trill, it went fine, and you didn’t have to think about it.\nAnd that’s when doing the trill is transferred from the frontal cortex to\nmore reflexive brain regions (e.g., the cerebellum). This transition to\nautomaticity also happens when you get good at a sport, when\neffortless habit? As we’ll see, honesty often comes more easily thanks to\nautomaticity. This helps explain the answer typically given after\nsomeone has been profoundly brave. “What were you thinking when you\ndove into the river to save that drowning child?” “I wasn’t thinking—\nbefore I knew it, I had jumped in.” Often the neurobiology of\nautomaticity mediates doing the hardest moral acts, while the\nneurobiology of the frontal cortex mediates working hard on a term\npaper about the subject.\nThe Frontal Cortex and Social Behavior\nThings get interesting when the frontal cortex has to add social\nfactors to a cognitive mix. For example, one part of the monkey PFC\ncontains neurons that activate when the monkey makes a mistake on a\ncognitive task or observes another monkey doing so; some activate only\nwhen it’s a particular animal who made the mistake. In a neuroimaging\nstudy humans had to choose something, balancing feedback obtained\nfrom their own prior choices with advice from another person. Different\nPFC circuits tracked “reward-driven” and “advice-driven” cogitating.49\nFindings like these segue into the central role of the frontal cortex in\nsocial behavior.50 This is appreciated when comparing various primates.\nAcross primate species, the bigger the size of the average social group,\nthe larger the relative size of the frontal cortex. This is particularly so\nwith “fission-fusion” species, where there are times when subgroups split\nup and function independently for a while before regrouping. Such a\nsocial structure is demanding, requiring the scaling of appropriate\nbehavior to subgroup size and composition. Logically, primates from\nfission-fusion species (chimps, bonobos, orangutans, spider monkeys)\nhave better frontocortical inhibitory control over behavior than do non-\nfission-fusion primates (gorillas, capuchins, macaques).\nAmong humans, the larger someone’s social network (measured by\nnumber of different people texted), the larger a particular PFC subregion\n(stay tuned).51 That’s cool, but we can’t tell if the big brain region causes\nWe utilize the frontal cortex to do the harder thing in social contexts\n—we praise the hosts for the inedible dinner; refrain from hitting the\ninfuriating coworker; don’t make sexual advances to someone, despite\nour fantasies; don’t belch loudly during the eulogy. A great way to\nappreciate the frontal cortex is to consider what happens when it is\ndamaged.\nThe first “frontal” patient, the famous Phineas Gage, was identified\nin 1848 in Vermont. Gage, the foreman on a railroad construction crew,\nwas injured when an accident with blasting powder blew a thirteen-\npound iron tamping rod through the left side of his face and out the top\nfront of his skull. It landed eighty feet away, along with much of his left\nfrontal cortex.52\nThe two known pictures of Gage, along with the tamping rod.\nRemarkably, he survived and recovered his health. But the respected,\nHe is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity\n(which was not previously his custom), manifesting but little\ndeference for his fellows, impatient of restraint or advice when it\nconflicts with his desires, at times pertinaciously obstinate, yet\ncapricious and vacillating, devising many plans of future\noperations, which are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned\nin turn for others appearing more feasible.\nGage was described by friends as “no longer Gage,” was incapable of\nresuming his job and was reduced to appearing (with his rod) as an\nexhibit displayed by P. T. Barnum. Poignant as hell.\n—\nAmazingly, Gage got better. Within a few years of his injury, he could\nresume work (mostly as a stagecoach driver) and was described as being\nbroadly appropriate in his behavior. His remaining right frontal cortical\ntissue had taken on some of the functions lost in the injury. Such\nmalleability of the brain is the focus of chapter 5.\n—\nAnother example of what happens when the frontal cortex is damaged is\nobserved in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which starts by damaging\nthe frontal cortex; intriguingly, the first neurons killed are those\nmysterious von Economo neurons that are unique to primates, elephants,\nand cetaceans.53 What are people with FTD like? They exhibit\nbehavioral disinhibition and socially inappropriate behaviors. There’s\nalso an apathy and lack of initiating behavior that reflects the fact that\nthe “decider” is being destroyed.*\nSomething similar is seen in Huntington’s disease, a horrific disorder\ndue to a thoroughly weird mutation. Subcortical circuits that coordinate\nsignaling to muscles are destroyed, and the sufferer is progressively\nincapacitated by involuntary writhing movements. Except that it turns\nout that there is frontal damage as well, often before the subcortical\ndamage. In about half the patients there’s also behavioral disinhibition—\nThere’s another circumstance where the frontal cortex is\nhypofunctional, producing similar behavioral manifestations—\nhypersexuality, outbursts of emotion, flamboyantly illogical acts.54 What\ndisease is this? It isn’t. You’re dreaming. During REM sleep, when\ndreaming occurs, the frontal cortex goes off-line, and dream scriptwriters\nrun wild. Moreover, if the frontal cortex is stimulated while people are\ndreaming, the dreams become less dreamlike, with more self-awareness.\nAnd there’s another nonpathological circumstance where the PFC\nsilences, producing emotional tsunamis: during orgasm.\nOne last realm of frontal damage. Adrian Raine of the University of\nPennsylvania and Kent Kiehl of the University of New Mexico report\nthat criminal psychopaths have decreased activity in the frontal cortex\nand less coupling of the PFC to other brain regions (compared with\nnonpsychopathic criminals and noncriminal controls). Moreover, a\nshockingly large percentage of people incarcerated for violent crimes\nhave a history of concussive trauma to the frontal cortex.55 More to come\nin chapter 16.\nThe Obligatory Declaration of the Falseness of the\nDichotomy Between Cognition and Emotion\nThe PFC consists of various parts, subparts, and sub-subparts,\nenough to keep neuroanatomists off the dole. Two regions are crucial.\nFirst there is the dorsal part of the PFC, especially the dorsolateral PFC\n(dlPFC)—don’t worry about “dorsal” or “dorsolateral”; it’s just jargon.*\nThe dlPFC is the decider of deciders, the most rational, cognitive,\nutilitarian, unsentimental part of the PFC. It’s the most recently evolved\npart of the PFC and the last part to fully mature. It mostly hears from and\ntalks to other cortical regions.\nIn contrast to the dlPFC, there’s the ventral part of the PFC,\nparticularly the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). This is the frontocortical\nregion that the visionary neuroanatomist Nauta made an honorary\nThe functions of the cognitive dlPFC are the essence of doing the\nharder thing.56 It’s the most active frontocortical region when someone\nforgoes an immediate reward for a bigger one later. Consider a classic\nmoral quandary—is it okay to kill one innocent person to save five?\nWhen people ponder the question, greater dlPFC activation predicts a\ngreater likelihood of answering yes (but as we’ll see in chapter 13, it also\ndepends on how you ask the question).\nMonkeys with dlPFC lesions can’t switch strategies in a task when\nthe rewards given for each strategy shift—they perseverate with the\nstrategy offering the most immediate reward.57 Similarly, humans with\ndlPFC damage are impaired in planning or gratification postponement,\nperseverate on strategies that offer immediate reward, and show poor\nexecutive control over their behavior.* Remarkably, the technique of\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation can temporarily silence part of\nsomeone’s cortex, as was done in a fascinating study by Ernst Fehr of the\nUniversity of Zurich.58 When the dlPFC was silenced, subjects playing\nan economic game impulsively accepted lousy offers that they’d\nnormally reject in the hopes of getting better offers in the future.\nCrucially, this was about sociality—silencing the dlPFC had no effect if\nsubjects thought the other player was a computer. Moreover, controls and\nsubjects with silenced dlPFCs rated lousy offers as being equally unfair;\nthus, as concluded by the authors, “subjects [with the silenced dlPFC]\nbehave as if they can no longer implement their fairness goals.”\nWhat are the functions of the emotional vmPFC?59 What you’d\nexpect, given its inputs from limbic structures. It activates if the person\nyou’re rooting for wins a game, or if you listen to pleasant versus\ndissonant music (particularly if the music provokes a shiver-down-the-\nspine moment).\nWhat are the effects of vmPFC damage?60 Lots of things remain\nnormal—intelligence, working memory, making estimates. Individuals\ncan “do the harder thing” with purely cognitive frontal tasks (e.g.,\npuzzles where you have to give up a step of progress in order to gain two\nmore).\nThe differences appear when it comes to making social/emotional\nDamasio has produced an influential theory about emotion-laden\ndecision making, rooted in the philosophies of Hume and William James;\nthis will soon be discussed.61 Briefly, the frontal cortex runs “as if”\nexperiments of gut feelings—“How would I feel if this outcome\noccurred?”—and makes choices with the answer in mind. Damaging the\nvmPFC, thus removing limbic input to the PFC, eliminates gut feelings,\nmaking decisions harder.\nMoreover, eventual decisions are highly utilitarian. vmPFC patients\nare atypically willing to sacrifice one person, including a family member,\nto save five strangers.62 They’re more interested in outcomes than in\ntheir underlying emotional motives, punishing someone who accidentally\nkills but not one who tried to kill but failed, because, after all, no one\ndied in the second case.\nIt’s Mr. Spock, running on only the dlPFC. Now for a crucial point.\nPeople who dichotomize between thought and emotion often prefer the\nformer, viewing emotion as suspect. It gums up decision making by\ngetting sentimental, sings too loudly, dresses flamboyantly, has\nunsettling amounts of armpit hair. In this view, get rid of the vmPFC, and\nwe’d be more rational and function better.\nBut that’s not the case, as emphasized eloquently by Damasio. People\nwith vmPFC damage not only have trouble making decisions but also\nmake bad ones.63 They show poor judgment in choosing friends and\npartners and don’t shift behavior based on negative feedback. For\nexample, consider a gambling task where reward rates for various\nstrategies change without subjects knowing it, and subjects can shift their\nplay strategy. Control subjects shift optimally, even if they can’t\nverbalize how reward rates have changed. Those with vmPFC damage\ndon’t, even when they can verbalize. Without a vmPFC, you may know\nthe meaning of negative feedback, but you don’t know the feeling of it in\nyour gut and thus don’t shift behavior.\nAs we saw, without the dlPFC, the metaphorical superego is gone,\nresulting in individuals who are now hyperaggressive, hypersexual ids.\nBut without a vmPFC, behavior is inappropriate in a detached way. This\nis the person who, encountering someone after a long time, says, “Hello,\nInstead it’s essential.64 It wouldn’t be if we had evolved into Vulcans.\nBut as long as the world is filled with humans, evolution would never\nhave made us that way.\nActivation of the dlPFC and vmPFC can be inversely correlated. In\nan inspired study where a keyboard was provided to jazz pianists inside a\nbrain scanner, the vmPFC became more active and the dlPFC less so\nwhen subjects improvised. In another study, subjects judged hypothetical\nharmful acts. Pondering perpetrators’ responsibility activated the dlPFC;\ndeciding the amount of punishment activated the vmPFC.* When\nsubjects did a gambling task where reward probabilities for various\nstrategies shifted and they could always change strategies, decision\nmaking reflected two factors: (a) the outcome of their most recent action\n(the better that had turned out, the more vmPFC activation), and (b)\nreward rates from all the previous rounds, something requiring a long\nretrospective view (the better the long-term rewards, the more dlPFC\nactivation). Relative activation between the two regions predicted the\ndecision subjects made.65\nA simplistic view is that the vmPFC and dlPFC perpetually battle for\ndomination by emotion versus cognition. But while emotion and\ncognition can be somewhat separable, they’re rarely in opposition.\nInstead they are intertwined in a collaborative relationship needed for\nnormal function, and as tasks with both emotive and cognitive\ncomponents become more difficult (making an increasingly complex\neconomic decision in a setting that is increasingly unfair), activity in the\ntwo structures becomes more synchronized.\nThe Frontal Cortex and Its Relationship with the\nLimbic System\nWe now have a sense of what different subdivisions of the PFC do\nand how cognition and emotion interact neurobiologically. This leads us\nto consider how the frontal cortex and limbic system interact.\nIn landmark studies Joshua Greene of Harvard and Princeton’s\nproblem is key. In one version you pull a lever, diverting the trolley onto\na side track. This saves the five, but the trolley kills someone who\nhappened to be on this other track; 70 to 90 percent of people say they\nwould do this. In the second scenario you push the person in front of the\ntrolley with your own hands. This stops the trolley, but the person is\nkilled; 70 to 90 percent say no way. The same numerical trade-off, but\nutterly different decisions.\nGreene and Cohen gave subjects the two versions while\nneuroimaging them. Contemplating intentionally killing someone with\nyour own hands activates the decider dlPFC, along with emotion-related\nregions that respond to aversive stimuli (including a cortical region\nactivated by emotionally laden words), the amygdala, and the vmPFC.\nThe more amygdaloid activation and the more negative emotions the\nparticipant reported in deciding, the less likely they were to push.\nAnd when people contemplate detachedly pulling a lever that\ninadvertently kills someone? The dlPFC alone activates. As purely\ncerebral a decision as choosing which wrench to use to fix a widget. A\ngreat study.*\nOther studies have examined interactions between “cognitive” and\n“emotional” parts of the brain. A few examples:\nChapter 3 discusses some unsettling research—stick your\naverage person in a brain scanner, and show him a picture of\nsomeone of another race for only a tenth of a second. This is too\nfast for him to be aware of what he saw. But thanks to that\nanatomical shortcut, the amygdala knows . . . and activates. In\ncontrast, show the picture for a longer time. Again the amygdala\nactivates, but then the cognitive dlPFC does as well, inhibiting\nthe amygdala—the effort to control what is for most people an\nunpalatable initial response.\nChapter 6 discusses experiments where a subject plays a game\nwith two other people and is manipulated into feeling that she is\nbeing left out. This activates her amygdala, periaqueductal gray\nfriends; my dog loves me.” And the amygdala et al. quiet down.\nAnd what if you do the same to someone whose frontal cortex is\nnot fully functional? The amygdala is increasingly activated; the\nperson feels increasingly distressed. What neurological disease is\ninvolved? None. This is a typical teenager.\nFinally, the PFC mediates fear extinction. Yesterday the rat\nlearned, “That tone is followed by a shock,” so the sound of the\ntone began to trigger freezing. Today there are no shocks, and the\nrat has acquired another truth that takes precedence—“but not\ntoday.” The first truth is still there; as proof, start coupling tone\nwith shock again, and freezing to tone is “reinstated” faster than\nthe association was initially learned.\nWhere is “but not today” consolidated? In the PFC, after receiving\ninformation from the hippocampus.67 The medial PFC activates\ninhibitory circuits in the BLA, and the rat stops freezing to the tone. In a\nsimilar vein but reflecting cognition specific to humans, condition people\nto associate a blue square on a screen with a shock, and the amygdala\nwill activate when seeing that square—but less so in subjects who\nreappraise the situation, activating the medial PFC by thinking of, say, a\nbeautiful blue sky.\nThis segues into the subject of regulating emotion through thought.68\nIt’s hard to regulate thought (try not thinking about a hippo) but even\ntougher with emotion; research by my Stanford colleague and close\nfriend James Gross has explored this. First off, “thinking differently”\nabout something emotional differs from simply suppressing the\nexpression of the emotions. For example, show someone graphic footage\nof, say, an amputation. Subjects cringe, activate the amygdala and\nsympathetic nervous system. Now one group is instructed to hide their\nemotions (“I’m going to show you another film clip, and I want you to\nhide your emotional reactions”). How to do so most effectively? Gross\ndistinguishes between “antecedent” and “response”-focused strategies.\nAntecedent strategies generally work better, as they keep the barn\ndoor closed from the start. These are about thinking/feeling about\nsomething else (e.g., that great vacation), or thinking/feeling differently\nabout what you’re seeing (reappraisals such as “That isn’t real; those are\njust actors”). And when done right, the PFC, particularly the dlPFC,\nactivates, the amygdala and sympathetic nervous system are damped,\nand subjective distress decreases.*\nAntecedent reappraisal is why placebos work.69 Thinking, “My\nfinger is about to be pricked by a pin,” activates the amygdala along with\na circuit of pain-responsive brain regions, and the pin hurts. Be told\nbeforehand that the hand cream being slathered on your finger is a\npowerful analgesic cream, and you think, “My finger is about to be\npricked by a pin, but this cream will block the pain.” The PFC activates,\nblunting activity in the amygdala and pain circuitry, as well as pain\nperception.\nThought processes like these, writ large, are the core of a particularly\neffective type of psychotherapy—cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—\nfor the treatment of disorders of emotion regulation.70 Consider someone\nwith a social anxiety disorder caused by a horrible early experience with\ntrauma. To simplify, CBT is about providing the tools to reappraise\ncircumstances that evoke the anxiety—remember that in this social\nsituation those awful feelings you’re having are about what happened\nback then, not what is happening now.*\nControlling emotional responses with thought like this is very top\ndown; the frontal cortex calms the overwrought amygdala. But the\nPFC/limbic relationship can be bottom up as well, when a decision\ninvolves a gut feeling. This is the backbone of Damasio’s somatic marker\nhypothesis. Choosing among options can involve a cerebral cost-benefit\nanalysis. But it also involves “somatic markers,” internal simulations of\nwhat each outcome would feel like, run in the limbic system and\nreported to the vmPFC. The process is not a thought experiment; it’s an\nemotion experiment, in effect an emotional memory of a possible future.\nA mild somatic marker activates only the limbic system.71 “Should I\ndo behavior A? Maybe not—the possibility of outcome B feels scary.” A\nThis is a picture of normal collaboration between the limbic system\nand frontal cortex.72 Naturally, things are not always balanced. Anger,\nfor example, makes people less analytical and more reflexive in\ndecisions about punishment. Stressed people often make hideously bad\ndecisions, marinated in emotion; chapter 4 examines what stress does to\nthe amygdala and frontal cortex.*\nThe effects of stress on the frontal cortex are dissected by the late\nHarvard psychologist Daniel Wegner in an aptly titled paper, “How to\nThink, Say or Do Precisely the Worst Thing on Any Occasion.”73 He\nconsiders what Edgar Allan Poe called the “imp of the perverse”:\nWe see a rut coming up in the road ahead and proceed to steer our\nbike right into it. We make a mental note not to mention a sore\npoint in conversation and then cringe in horror as we blurt out\nexactly that thing. We carefully cradle the glass of red wine as we\ncross the room, all the while thinking “don’t spill,” and then\njuggle it onto the carpet under the gaze of our host.\nWegner demonstrated a two-step process of frontocortical regulation:\n(A) one stream identifies X as being very important; (B) the other stream\ntracks whether the conclusion is “Do X” or “Never do X.” And during\nstress, distraction, or heavy cognitive load, the two streams can\ndissociate; the A stream exerts its presence without the B stream saying\nwhich fork in the road to take. The chance that you will do precisely the\nwrong thing rises not despite your best efforts but because of a stress-\nboggled version of them.\n—\nThis concludes our overview of the frontal cortex; the mantra is that it\nmakes you do the harder thing when that is the right thing. Five final\npoints:\n“Doing the harder thing” effectively is not an argument\nare most prosocial concerning out-group morality when\ncognition holds sway.\nIt’s easy to conclude that the PFC is about preventing\nimprudent behaviors (“Don’t do it; you’ll regret it”). But\nthat isn’t always the case. For example, in chapter 17\nwe’ll consider the surprising amount of frontocortical\neffort it can take to pull a trigger.\nLike everything about the brain, the structure and\nfunction of the frontal cortex vary enormously among\nindividuals; for example, resting metabolic rate in the\nPFC varies approximately thirtyfold among people.*\nWhat causes such individual differences? See the rest of\nthis book.74\n“Doing the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.”\n“Right” in this case is used in a neurobiological and\ninstrumental sense, rather than a moral one.\nConsider lying. Obviously, the frontal cortex aids the\nhard job of resisting the temptation. But it is also a\nmajor frontocortical task, particularly a dlPFC task, to\nlie competently, to control the emotional content of a\nsignal, to generate an abstract distance between message\nand meaning. Interestingly, pathological liars have\natypically large amounts of white matter in the PFC,\nindicating more complex wiring.75\nBut again, the “right thing,” in the setting of the frontal cortically\nassisted lying, is amoral. An actor lies to an audience about having the\nfeelings of a morose Danish prince. A situationally ethical child lies,\ntelling Grandma how excited she is about her present, concealing the fact\nthat she already has that toy. A leader tells bold-faced lies, starting a war.\nA financier with Ponzi in his blood defrauds investors. A peasant woman\nlies to a uniformed thug, telling him she does not know the whereabouts\nof the refugees she knows are hiding in her attic. As with much about the\n66\nWhere does the frontal cortex get the metaphorical motivation to do the\nharder thing? For this we now look at our final branch, the dopaminergic\n“reward” system in the brain.\n\nDOPAMINE SYSTEM\neward, pleasure, and happiness are complex, and the motivated\npursuit of them occurs in at least a rudimentary form in many\nspecies. The neurotransmitter dopamine is central to understanding this.\nNuclei, Inputs, and Outputs\nDopamine is synthesized in multiple brain regions. One such region\nhelps initiate movement; damage there produces Parkinson’s disease.\nAnother regulates the release of a pituitary hormone. But the\ndopaminergic system that concerns us arises from an ancient,\nevolutionarily conserved region near the brain stem called the ventral\ntegmental area (henceforth the “tegmentum”).\nA key target of these dopaminergic neurons is the last multisyllabic\nbrain region to be introduced in this chapter, the nucleus accumbens\n(henceforth the “accumbens”). There’s debate as to whether the\naccumbens should count as part of the limbic system, but at the least it’s\nhighly limbic-ish.\nHere’s our first pass at the organization of this circuitry:76\na. The tegmentum sends projections to the accumbens and\n(other) limbic areas such as the amygdala and\nhippocampus. This is collectively called the\n“mesolimbic dopamine pathway.”\nb. The tegmentum also projects to the PFC (but,\nsignificantly, not other cortical areas). This is called the\n“mesocortical dopamine pathway.” I’ll be lumping the\nmesolimbic plus mesocortical pathways together as the\nd. Naturally, most areas getting projections from the\ntegmentum and/or accumbens project back to them.\nMost interesting will be the projections from the\namygdala and PFC.\nReward\nAs a first pass, the dopaminergic system is about reward—various\npleasurable stimuli activate tegmental neurons, triggering their release of\ndopamine.77 Some supporting evidence: (a) drugs like cocaine, heroin,\nand alcohol release dopamine in the accumbens; (b) if tegmental release\nof dopamine is blocked, previously rewarding stimuli become aversive;\n(c) chronic stress or pain depletes dopamine and decreases the sensitivity\nof dopamine neurons to stimulation, producing the defining symptom of\ndepression—“anhedonia,” the inability to feel pleasure.\nSome rewards, such as sex, release dopamine in every species\nexamined.78 For humans, just thinking about sex suffices.*79 Food\nevokes dopamine release in hungry individuals of all species, with an\nadded twist in humans. Show a picture of a milkshake to someone after\nthey’ve consumed one, and there’s rarely dopaminergic activation—\nthere’s satiation. But with subjects who have been dieting, there’s further\nactivation. If you’re working to restrict your food intake, a milkshake\njust makes you want another one.\nThe mesolimbic dopamine system also responds to pleasurable\naesthetics.80 In one study people listened to new music; the more\naccumbens activation, the more likely subjects were to buy the music\nafterward. And then there is dopaminergic activation for artificial\ncultural inventions—for example, when typical males look at pictures of\nsports cars.\nPatterns of dopamine release are most interesting when concerning\nsocial interactions.81 Some findings are downright heartwarming. In one\nstudy a subject would play an economic game with someone, where a\nplayer is rewarded under two circumstances: (a) if both players\nOther research examined the economic behavior of punishing jerks.82\nIn one study subjects played a game where player B could screw over\nplayer A for a profit. Depending on the round, player A could either (a)\ndo nothing, (b) punish player B by having some of player B’s money\ntaken (at no cost to player B), or (c) pay one unit of money to have two\nunits taken from player B. Punishment activated the dopamine system,\nespecially when subjects had to pay to punish; the greater the dopamine\nincrease during no-cost punishment, the more willing someone was to\npay to punish. Punishing norm violations is satisfying.\nAnother great study, carried out by Elizabeth Phelps of New York\nUniversity, concerns “overbidding” in auctions, where people bid more\nmoney than anticipated.83 This is interpreted as reflecting the additional\nreward of besting someone in the competitive aspect of bidding. Thus,\n“winning” an auction is intrinsically socially competitive, unlike\n“winning” a lottery. Winning a lottery and winning a bid both activated\ndopaminergic signaling in subjects; losing a lottery had no effect, while\nlosing a bidding war inhibited dopamine release. Not winning the lottery\nis bad luck; not winning an auction is social subordination.\nThis raises the specter of envy. In one neuroimaging study subjects\nread about a hypothetical person’s academic record, popularity,\nattractiveness, and wealth.84 Descriptions that evoked self-reported envy\nactivated cortical regions involved in pain perception. Then the\nhypothetical individual was described as experiencing a misfortune (e.g.,\nthey were demoted). More activation of pain pathways at the news of the\nperson’s good fortune predicted more dopaminergic activation after\nlearning of their misfortune. Thus there’s dopaminergic activation during\nschadenfreude—gloating over an envied person’s fall from grace.\nThe dopamine system gives insights into jealousy, resentment, and\ninvidiousness, leading to another depressing finding.85 A monkey has\nlearned that when he presses a lever ten times, he gets a raisin as a\nreward. That’s just happened, and as a result, ten units of dopamine are\nreleased in the accumbens. Now—surprise!—the monkey presses the\nlever ten times and gets two raisins. Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are\nreleased. And as the monkey continues to get paychecks of two raisins,\nUnfortunately, things have to work this way because of our range of\nrewards.86 After all, reward coding must accommodate the rewarding\nproperties of both solving a math problem and having an orgasm.\nDopaminergic responses to reward, rather than being absolute, are\nrelative to the reward value of alternative outcomes. In order to\naccommodate the pleasures of both mathematics and orgasms, the\nsystem must constantly rescale to accommodate the range of intensity\noffered by particular stimuli. The response to any reward must habituate\nwith repetition, so that the system can respond over its full range to the\nnext new thing.\nThis was shown in a beautiful study by Wolfram Schultz of\nCambridge University.87 Depending on the circumstance, monkeys were\ntrained to expect either two or twenty units of reward. If they\nunexpectedly got either four or forty units, respectively, there’d be an\nidentical burst of dopamine release; giving one or ten units produced an\nidentical decrease. It was the relative, not absolute, size of the surprise\nthat mattered over a tenfold range of reward.\nThese studies show that the dopamine system is bidirectional.88 It\nresponds with scale-free increases for unexpected good news and\ndecreases for bad. Schultz demonstrated that following a reward, the\ndopamine system codes for discrepancy from expectation—get what you\nexpected, and there’s a steady-state dribble of dopamine. Get more\nreward and/or get it sooner than expected, and there’s a big burst; less\nand/or later, a decrease. Some tegmental neurons respond to positive\ndiscrepancy from expectation, others to negative; appropriately, the latter\nare local neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.\nThose same neurons participate in habituation, where the reward that\nonce elicited a big dopamine response becomes less exciting.*\nLogically, these different types of coding neurons in the tegmentum\n(as well as the accumbens) get projections from the frontal cortex—that’s\nwhere all the expectancy/discrepancy calculations take place—“Okay, I\nthought I was going to get 5.0 but got 4.9. How big of a bummer is\nthat?”\nAdditional cortical regions weigh in. In one study subjects were\nactivation of that disgust-related insular cortex. Combine all the\nneuroimaging data, and you could predict whether the person would buy\nthe item.\nThus, in typical mammals the dopamine system codes in a scale-free\nmanner over a wide range of experience for both good and bad surprises\nand is constantly habituating to yesterday’s news. But humans have\nsomething in addition, namely that we invent pleasures far more intense\nthan anything offered by the natural world.\nOnce, during a concert of cathedral organ music, as I sat getting\ngooseflesh amid that tsunami of sound, I was struck with a thought: for a\nmedieval peasant, this must have been the loudest human-made sound\nthey ever experienced, awe-inspiring in now-unimaginable ways. No\nwonder they signed up for the religion being proffered. And now we are\nconstantly pummeled with sounds that dwarf quaint organs. Once,\nhunter-gatherers might chance upon honey from a beehive and thus\nbriefly satisfy a hardwired food craving. And now we have hundreds of\ncarefully designed commercial foods that supply a burst of sensation\nunmatched by some lowly natural food. Once, we had lives that, amid\nconsiderable privation, also offered numerous subtle, hard-won\npleasures. And now we have drugs that cause spasms of pleasure and\ndopamine release a thousandfold higher than anything stimulated in our\nold drug-free world.\nAn emptiness comes from this combination of over-the-top\nnonnatural sources of reward and the inevitability of habituation; this is\nbecause unnaturally strong explosions of synthetic experience and\nsensation and pleasure evoke unnaturally strong degrees of habituation.90\nThis has two consequences. First, soon we barely notice the fleeting\nwhispers of pleasure caused by leaves in autumn, or by the lingering\nglance of the right person, or by the promise of reward following a\ndifficult, worthy task. And the other consequence is that we eventually\nhabituate to even those artificial deluges of intensity. If we were\ndesigned by engineers, as we consumed more, we’d desire less. But our\nfrequent human tragedy is that the more we consume, the hungrier we\nget. More and faster and stronger. What was an unexpected pleasure\ndopamine is more interesting than that. Back to our well-trained monkey\nworking for a reward. A light comes on in his room, signaling the start of\na reward trial. He goes over to the lever, presses ten times, and gets the\nraisin reward; this has happened often enough that there’s only a small\nincrease in dopamine with each raisin.\nHowever, importantly, lots of dopamine is released when the light\nfirst comes on, signaling the start of the reward trial, before the monkey\nstarts lever pressing.\nVisit bit.ly/2ovJngg for a larger version of this graph.\nIn other words, once reward contingencies are learned, dopamine is\nless about reward than about its anticipation. Similarly, work by my\nStanford colleague Brian Knutson has shown dopamine pathway\nactivation in people in anticipation of a monetary reward.91 Dopamine is\nabout mastery and expectation and confidence. It’s “I know how things\nwork; this is going to be great.” In other words, the pleasure is in the\nanticipation of reward, and the reward itself is nearly an afterthought\n(unless, of course, the reward fails to arrive, in which case it’s the most\nimportant thing in the world). If you know your appetite will be sated,\npleasure is more about the appetite than about the sating.* This is hugely\nimportant.\nthat become more excitable.\nThis explains context-dependent craving in addiction.93 Suppose an\nalcoholic has been clean and sober for years. Return him to where the\nalcohol consumption used to occur (e.g., that rundown street corner, that\nfancy men’s club), and those potentiated synapses, those cues that were\nlearned to be associated with alcohol, come roaring back into action,\ndopamine surges with anticipation, and the craving inundates.\nCan a reliable cue of an impending reward eventually become\nrewarding itself? This has been shown by Huda Akil of the University of\nMichigan. A light in the left side of a rat’s cage signals that lever\npressing will produce a reward from a food chute on the right side.\nRemarkably, rats eventually will work for the chance to hang around on\nthe left side of the cage, just because it feels so nice to be there. The\nsignal has gained the dopaminergic power of what is being signaled.\nSimilarly, rats will work to be exposed to a cue that signals that some\nkind of reward is likely, without knowing what or when. This is what\nfetishes are, in both the anthropological and sexual sense.94\nSchultz’s group has shown that the magnitude of an anticipatory\ndopamine rise reflects two variables. First is the size of the anticipated\nreward. A monkey has learned that a light means that ten lever presses\nearns one unit of reward, while a tone means ten presses earns ten units.\nAnd soon a tone provokes more anticipatory dopamine than does a light.\nIt’s “This is going to be great” versus “This is going to be great.”\nThe second variable is extraordinary. The rule is that the light comes\non, you press the lever, you get the reward. Now things change. Light\ncomes on, press the lever, get the reward . . . only 50 percent of the time.\nRemarkably, once that new scenario is learned, far more dopamine is\nreleased. Why? Because nothing fuels dopamine release like the\n“maybe” of intermittent reinforcement.95\nThis additional dopamine is released at a distinctive time. The light\ncomes on in the 50 percent scenario, producing the usual anticipatory\ndopamine rise before the lever pressing starts. Back in the predictable\ndays when lever pressing always earned a reward, once the pressing was\nVisit bit.ly/2o3Zvcq for a larger version of this graph.\nModify things further; reward now occurs 25 or 75 percent of the\ntime. A shift from 50 to 25 percent and a shift from 50 to 75 percent are\nexactly opposite, in terms of the likelihood of reward, and work from\nKnutson’s group shows that the greater the probability of reward, the\nmore activation in the medial PFC.96 But switches from 50 to 25 percent\nand from 50 to 75 percent both reduce the magnitude of uncertainty. And\nthe secondary rise of dopamine for a 25 or 75 percent likelihood of\nreward is smaller than for 50 percent. Thus, anticipatory dopamine\nrelease peaks with the greatest uncertainty as to whether a reward will\noccur.* Interestingly, in circumstances of uncertainty, enhanced\nanticipatory dopamine release is mostly in the mesocortical rather than\nmesolimbic pathway, implying that uncertainty is a more cognitively\ncomplex state than is anticipation of predictable reward.\nNone of this is news to the honorary psychologists running Las\nVegas. Logically, gambling shouldn’t evoke much anticipatory\ndopamine, given the astronomical odds against winning. But the\nbehavioral engineering—the 24-7 activity and lack of time cues, the\ncheap alcohol pickling frontocortical judgment, the manipulations to\nmake you feel like today is your lucky day—distorts and shifts the\nreels line up in a slot machine. In control subjects there was minimal\ndopaminergic activation after misses of any sort; among pathological\ngamblers, a near miss activated the dopamine system like crazy. Another\nstudy concerned two betting situations with identical probabilities of\nreward but different levels of information about reward contingencies.\nThe circumstance with less information (i.e., that was more about\nambiguity than risk) activated the amygdala and silenced dopaminergic\nsignaling; what is perceived to be well-calibrated risk is addictive, while\nambiguity is just agitating.97\nPursuit\nSo dopamine is more about anticipation of reward than about reward\nitself. Time for one more piece of the picture. Consider that monkey\ntrained to respond to the light cue with lever pressing, and out comes the\nreward; as we now know, once that relationship is established, most\ndopamine release is anticipatory, occurring right after the cue.\nWhat happens if the post–light cue release of dopamine doesn’t\noccur?98 Crucially, the monkey doesn’t press the lever. Similarly, if you\ndestroy its accumbens, a rat makes impulsive choices, instead of holding\nout for a delayed larger reward. Conversely, back to the monkey—if\ninstead of flashing the light cue you electrically stimulate the tegmentum\nto release dopamine, the monkey presses the lever. Dopamine is not just\nabout reward anticipation; it fuels the goal-directed behavior needed to\ngain that reward; dopamine “binds” the value of a reward to the resulting\nwork. It’s about the motivation arising from those dopaminergic\nprojections to the PFC that is needed to do the harder thing (i.e., to\nwork).\nIn other words, dopamine is not about the happiness of reward. It’s\nabout the happiness of pursuit of reward that has a decent chance of\noccurring.*99\nThis is central to understanding the nature of motivation, as well as\nits failures (e.g., during depression, where there is inhibition of dopamine\nimmediate reward activates limbic targets of dopamine (i.e., the\nmesolimbic pathway), whereas contemplating the delayed reward\nactivates frontocortical targets (i.e., the mesocortical pathway). The\ngreater the activation of the latter, the more likely there’ll be gratification\npostponement.\nThese studies involved scenarios of a short burst of work soon\nfollowed by reward.101 What about when the work required is prolonged,\nand reward is substantially delayed? In that scenario there is a secondary\nrise of dopamine, a gradual increase that fuels the sustained work; the\nextent of the dopamine ramp-up is a function of the length of the delay\nand the anticipated size of the reward:\nVisit bit.ly/2ngTC7V for a larger version of this graph.\nThis reveals how dopamine fuels delayed gratification. If waiting X\namount of time for a reward has value Z; waiting 2X should logically\nhave value ½Z; instead we “temporally discount”—the value is smaller,\ne.g., ¼Z. We don’t like waiting.\nDopamine and the frontal cortex are in the thick of this phenomenon.\nDiscounting curves—a value of ¼Z instead of ½Z—are coded in the\naccumbens, while dlPFC and vmPFC neurons code for time delay.102\nThis generates some complex interactions. For example, activate the\nvmPFC or inactivate the dlPFC, and short-term reward becomes more\nCollectively these studies show that our dopaminergic system, frontal\ncortex, amygdala, insula, and other members of the chorus code for\ndiffering aspects of reward magnitude, delay, and probability with\nvarying degrees of accuracy, all influencing whether we manage to do\nthe harder, more correct thing.104\nIndividual differences among people in the capacity for gratification\npostponement arise from variation in the volume of these individual\nneural voices.105 For example, there are abnormalities in dopamine\nresponse profiles during temporal discounting tasks in people with the\nmaladaptive impulsiveness of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD). Similarly, addictive drugs bias the dopamine system toward\nimpulsiveness.\nPhew. One more complication: These studies of temporal discounting\ntypically involve delays on the order of seconds. Though the dopamine\nsystem is similar across numerous species, humans do something utterly\nnovel: we delay gratification for insanely long times. No warthog\nrestricts calories to look good in a bathing suit next summer. No gerbil\nworks hard at school to get good SAT scores to get into a good college to\nget into a good grad school to get a good job to get into a good nursing\nhome. We do something even beyond this unprecedented gratification\ndelay: we use the dopaminergic power of the happiness of pursuit to\nmotivate us to work for rewards that come after we are dead—depending\non your culture, this can be knowing that your nation is closer to winning\na war because you’ve sacrificed yourself in battle, that your kids will\ninherit money because of your financial sacrifices, or that you will spend\neternity in paradise. It is extraordinary neural circuitry that bucks\ntemporal discounting enough to allow (some of) us to care about the\ntemperature of the planet that our great-grandchildren will inherit.\nBasically, it’s unknown how we humans do this. We may merely be a\ntype of animal, mammal, primate, and ape, but we’re a profoundly\nconcern us.\nStarting with a 1979 study, low levels of serotonin in the brain were\nshown to be associated with elevated levels of human aggression, with\nend points ranging from psychological measures of hostility to overt\nviolence.106 A similar serotonin/aggression relationship was observed in\nother mammals and, remarkably, even crickets, mollusks, and\ncrustaceans.\nAs work continued, an important qualifier emerged. Low serotonin\ndidn’t predict premeditated, instrumental violence. It predicted impulsive\naggression, as well as cognitive impulsivity (e.g., steep temporal\ndiscounting or trouble inhibiting a habitual response). Other studies\nlinked low serotonin to impulsive suicide (independent of severity of the\nassociated psychiatric illness).107\nMoreover, in both animals and humans pharmacologically decreasing\nserotonin signaling increases behavioral and cognitive impulsivity (e.g.,\nimpulsively torpedoing a stable, cooperative relationship with a player in\nan economic game).108 Importantly, while increasing serotonin signaling\ndid not lessen impulsiveness in normal subjects, it did in subjects prone\ntoward impulsivity, such as adolescents with conduct disorder.\nHow does serotonin do this? Nearly all serotonin is synthesized in\none brain region,* which projects to the usual suspects—the tegmentum,\naccumbens, PFC, and amygdala, where serotonin enhances dopamine’s\neffects on goal-directed behavior.109\nThis is as dependable a finding as you get in this business.110 Until\nwe get to chapter 8 and look at genes related to serotonin, at which point\neverything becomes a completely contradictory mess. Just as a hint of\nwhat’s to come, one gene variant has even been referred to, straight\nfaced, by some scientists as the “warrior gene,” and its presence has been\nhis completes our introduction to the nervous system and its role in\npro- and antisocial behaviors. It was organized around three\nthemes: the hub of fear, aggression, and arousal centered in the\namygdala; the hub of reward, anticipation, and motivation of the\ndopaminergic system; and the hub of frontal cortical regulation and\nrestraint of behavior. Additional brain regions and neurotransmitters will\nbe introduced in subsequent chapters. Amid this mountain of\ninformation, be assured that the key brain regions, circuits, and\nneurotransmitters will become familiar as the book progresses.\nHang on. So what does this all mean? It’s useful to start with three\nthings that this information doesn’t mean:\n1. First, there’s the lure of needing neurobiology to\nconfirm the obvious. Someone claims that, for example,\ntheir crappy, violent neighborhood leaves them so\nanxious that they can’t function effectively. Toss them in\na brain scanner and flash pictures of various\nneighborhoods; when their own appears, the amygdala\nexplodes into activity. “Ah,” it is tempting to conclude,\n“we’ve now proven that the person really does feel\nfrightened.”\nIt shouldn’t require neuroscience to validate\nsomeone’s internal state. An example of this\nfallacy was reports of atrophy of the hippocampus in\ncombat vets suffering from PTSD; this was in\naccord with basic research (including from my lab)\nshowing that stress can damage the hippocampus.\nThe hippocampal atrophy in PTSD got a lot of play\nin Washington, helping to convince skeptics that\nPTSD is an organic disorder rather than neurotic\nproblems of their own. Yet it required precisely this\nto “prove” to many that PTSD was an organic brain\ndisorder.\nThe notion that “if a neuroscientist can\ndemonstrate it, we know that the person’s\nproblem is for real” has a corollary—the fancier\nthe neurobiology utilized, the more reliable the\nverification. That’s simply not true; for example, a\ngood neuropsychologist can discern more of what’s\nhappening to someone with subtle but pervasive\nmemory problems than can a gazillion-dollar brain\nscanner.\nIt shouldn’t take neuroscience to “prove”\nwhat we think and feel.\n2. There’s been a proliferation of “neuro-” fields. Some,\nlike neuroendocrinology and neuroimmunology, are\nstodgy old institutions by now. Others are relatively new\n—neuroeconomics, neuromarketing, neuroethics, and, I\nkid you not, neuroliterature and neuroexistentialism. In\nother words, a hegemonic neuroscientist might conclude\nthat their field explains everything. And with that comes\nthe danger, raised by the New Yorker writer Adam\nGopnik under the sardonic banner of “neuroskepticism,”\nthat explaining everything leads to forgiving\neverything.111 This premise is at the heart of debates in\nthe new field of “neurolaw.” In chapter 16 I will argue\nthat it is wrong to think that understanding must lead to\nforgiveness—mainly because I think that a term like\n“forgiveness,” and others related to criminal justice\n(e.g., “evil,” “soul,” “volition,” and “blame”), are\nincompatible with science and should be discarded.\n3. Finally, there is the danger of thinking that neuroscience\nsupports a tacit sort of dualism. A guy does something\nimpulsive and awful, and neuroimaging reveals that,\nHowever, the guy’s awful, impulsive act is equally\n“biological” with or without a PFC. The sole difference\nis that the workings of the PFC-less brain are easier to\nunderstand with our primitive research tools.\nSo What Does All of This Tell Us?\nSometimes these studies tell us what different brain regions do. They\nare getting fancier, telling us about circuits, thanks to the growing time\nresolution of neuroimaging, transitioning from “This stimulus activates\nbrain regions A, B, C” to “This stimulus activates both A and B, and\nthen C, and C activates only if B does”. And identifying what specific\nregions/circuits do gets harder as studies become subtler. Consider, for\nexample, the fusiform face area. As discussed in the next chapter, it is a\ncortical region that responds to faces in humans and other primates. We\nprimates sure are social creatures.\nBut work by Isabel Gauthier of Vanderbilt University demonstrates\nsomething more complicated. Show pictures of different cars, and the\nfusiform activates—in automobile aficionados.112 Show pictures of\nbirds, and ditto among bird-watchers. The fusiform isn’t about faces; it’s\nabout recognizing examples of things from categories that are\nemotionally salient to each individual.\nThus, studying behavior is useful for understanding the nature of the\nbrain—ah, isn’t it interesting that behavior A arises from the coupling of\nbrain regions X and Y. And sometimes studying the brain is useful for\nunderstanding the nature of behavior—ah, isn’t it interesting that brain\nregion A is central to both behavior X and behavior Y. For example, to\nme the most interesting thing about the amygdala is its dual involvement\nin both aggression and fear; you can’t understand the former without\nrecognizing the relevance of the latter.\n—\nA final point related to the core of this book: While this neurobiology is\nmighty impressive, the brain is not where a behavior “begins.” It’s"

    "content": "Seconds to Minutes\nBefore\nothing comes from nothing. No brain is an island.\nThanks to messages bouncing around your brain, a command\nhas been sent to your muscles to pull that trigger or touch that arm. Odds\nare that a short time earlier, something outside your brain prompted this\nto happen, raising this chapter’s key questions: (a) What outside\nstimulus, acting through what sensory channel and targeting which parts\nof the brain, prompted this? (b) Were you aware of that environmental\nstimulus? (c) What stimuli had your brain made you particularly\nsensitive to? And, of course, (d) what does this tell us about our best and\nworst behaviors?\nVaried sensory information can prompt the brain into action. This can\nbe appreciated by considering this variety in other species. Often we’re\nclueless about this because animals can sense things in ranges that we\ncan’t, or with sensory modalities we didn’t know exist. Thus, you must\nthink like the animal to learn what is happening. We’ll begin by seeing\nKNEES\nthology formed in Europe in the early twentieth century in response\nto an American brand of psychology, “behaviorism.” Behaviorism\ndescended from the introduction’s John Watson; the field’s famed\nchampion was B. F. Skinner. Behaviorists cared about universalities of\nbehavior across species. They worshipped a doozy of a seeming\nuniversal concerning stimulus and response: rewarding an organism for a\nbehavior makes the organism more likely to repeat that behavior, while\nfailure to get rewarded or, worse, punishment for it, makes the organism\nless likely to repeat it. Any behavior can be made more or less common\nthrough “operant conditioning” (a term Skinner coined), the process of\ncontrolling the rewards and punishments in the organism’s environment.\nThus, for behaviorists (or “Skinnerians,” a term Skinner labored to\nmake synonymous) virtually any behavior could be “shaped” into greater\nor lesser frequency or even “extinguished” entirely.\nIf all behaving organisms obeyed these universal rules, you might as\nwell study a convenient species. Most behaviorist research was done on\nrats or, Skinner’s favorite, pigeons. Behaviorists loved data, no-nonsense\nhard numbers; these were generated by animals pressing or pecking\naway at levers in “operant conditioning boxes” (aka “Skinner boxes”).\nAnd anything discovered applied to any species. A pigeon is a rat is a\nboy, Skinner preached. Soulless droid.*\nBehaviorists were often right about behavior but wrong in really\nimportant ways, as many interesting behaviors don’t follow behaviorist\nrules.*1 Raise an infant rat or monkey with an abusive mother, and it\nbecomes more attached to her. And behaviorist rules have failed when\nhumans love the wrong abusive person.\nMeanwhile, ethology was emerging in Europe. In contrast with\nbehaviorism’s obsession with uniformity and universality of behavior,\nethologists loved behavioral variety. They’d emphasize how every\nadage). They’d ask, What, objectively, is the behavior? What triggered\nit? Did it have to be learned? How did it evolve? What is the behavior’s\nadaptive value? Nineteenth-century parsons went into nature to collect\nbutterflies, revel in the variety of wing colors, and marvel at what God\nhad wrought. Twentieth-century ethologists went into nature to collect\nbehavior, revel in its variety, and marvel at what evolution had wrought.\nIn contrast to lab coat–clad behaviorists, ethologists tromped around\nfields in hiking shoes and had fetching knobby knees.*\nSensory Triggers of Behavior in Some Other\nSpecies\nUsing an ethological framework, we now consider sensory triggers of\nbehavior in animals.*2 First there’s the auditory channel. Animals\nvocalize to intimidate, proclaim, and seduce. Birds sing, stags roar,\nhowler monkeys howl, orangutans give territorial calls audible for miles.\nAs a subtle example of information being communicated, when female\npandas ovulate, their vocalizations get higher, something preferred by\nmales. Remarkably, the same shift and preference happens in humans.\nThere are also visual triggers of behavior. Dogs crouch to invite play,\nbirds strut their plumage, monkeys display their canines menacingly with\n“threat yawns.” And there are visual cues of cute baby–ness (big eyes,\nshortened muzzle, round forehead) that drive mammals crazy, motivating\nthem to care for the kid. Stephen Jay Gould noted that the unsung\nethologist Walt Disney understood exactly what alterations transformed\nrodents into Mickey and Minnie.*3\nThen there are animals signaling in ways we can’t detect, requiring\ncreativity to interview an animal in its own language.4 Scads of\nmammals scent mark with pheromones—odors that carry information\nabout sex, age, reproductive status, health, and genetic makeup. Some\nsnakes see in infrared, electric eels court with electric songs, bats\ncompete by jamming one another’s feeding echolocation signals, and\nspiders identify intruders by vibration patterns on their webs. How about\nolfaction. Across species the dominant sensory modality—vision,\nsounds, whichever—has the most direct access to the limbic system.\nUnder the Radar: Subliminal and Unconscious\nCuing\nIt’s easy to see how the sight of a knife, the sound of a voice calling\nyour name, a touch on your hand can rapidly alter your brain.5 But\ncrucially, tons of subliminal sensory triggers occur—so fleeting or\nminimal that we don’t consciously note them, or of a type that, even if\nnoted, seems irrelevant to a subsequent behavior.\nSubliminal cuing and unconscious priming influence numerous\nbehaviors unrelated to this book. People think potato chips taste better\nwhen hearing crunching sounds. We like a neutral stimulus more if, just\nbefore seeing it, a picture of a smiling face is flashed for a twentieth of a\nsecond. The more expensive a supposed (placebo) painkiller, the more\neffective people report the placebo to be. Ask subjects their favorite\ndetergent; if they’ve just read a paragraph containing the word “ocean,”\nthey’re more likely to choose Tide—and then explain its cleaning\nvirtues.6\nThus, over the course of seconds sensory cues can shape your\nbehavior unconsciously.\nA hugely unsettling sensory cue concerns race.7 Our brains are\nincredibly attuned to skin color. Flash a face for less than a tenth of a\nsecond (one hundred milliseconds), so short a time that people aren’t\neven sure they’ve seen something. Have them guess the race of the\npictured face, and there’s a better-than-even chance of accuracy. We may\nclaim to judge someone by the content of their character rather than by\nthe color of their skin. But our brains sure as hell note the color, real fast.\nBy one hundred milliseconds, brain function already differs in two\ndepressing ways, depending on the race of the face (as shown with\nneuroimaging). First, in a widely replicated finding, the amygdala\nshown by Elizabeth Phelps of NYU, such “fear conditioning” occurs\nfaster for other-race than same-race faces. Amygdalae are prepared to\nlearn to associate something bad with Them. Moreover, people judge\nneutral other-race faces as angrier than neutral same-race faces.\nSo if whites see a black face shown at a subliminal speed, the\namygdala activates.10 But if the face is shown long enough for conscious\nprocessing, the anterior cingulate and the “cognitive” dlPFC then\nactivate and inhibit the amygdala. It’s the frontal cortex exerting\nexecutive control over the deeper, darker amygdaloid response.\nSecond depressing finding: subliminal signaling of race also affects\nthe fusiform face area, the cortical region that specializes in facial\nrecognition.11 Damaging the fusiform, for example, selectively produces\n“face blindness” (aka prosopagnosia), an inability to recognize faces.\nWork by John Gabrieli at MIT demonstrates less fusiform activation for\nother-race faces, with the effect strongest in the most implicitly racist\nsubjects. This isn’t about novelty—show a face with purple skin and the\nfusiform responds as if it’s same-race. The fusiform isn’t fooled\n—“That’s not an Other; it’s just a ‘normal’ Photoshopped face.”\nIn accord with that, white Americans remember white better than\nblack faces; moreover, mixed-race faces are remembered better if\ndescribed as being of a white rather than a black person. Remarkably, if\nmixed-race subjects are told they’ve been assigned to one of the two\nraces for the study, they show less fusiform response to faces of the\narbitrarily designated “other” race.12\nOur attunement to race is shown in another way, too.13 Show a video\nof someone’s hand being poked with a needle, and subjects have an\n“isomorphic sensorimotor” response—hands tense in empathy. Among\nboth whites and blacks, the response is blunted for other-race hands; the\nmore the implicit racism, the more blunting. Similarly, among subjects of\nboth races, there’s more activation of the (emotional) medial PFC when\nconsidering misfortune befalling a member of their own race than of\nanother race.\nThis has major implications. In work by Joshua Correll at the\nUniversity of Colorado, subjects were rapidly shown pictures of people\nunarmed Diallo started to pull out his wallet, they decided it was a gun\nand fired forty-one shots. The underlying neurobiology concerns “event-\nrelated potentials” (ERPs), which are stimulus-induced changes in\nelectrical activity of the brain (as assessed by EEG—\nelectroencephalography). Threatening faces produce a distinctive change\n(called the P200 component) in the ERP waveform in under two hundred\nmilliseconds. Among white subjects, viewing someone black evokes a\nstronger P200 waveform than viewing someone white, regardless of\nwhether the person is armed. Then, a few milliseconds later, a second,\ninhibitory waveform (the N200 component) appears, originating from\nthe frontal cortex—“Let’s think a sec about what we’re seeing before we\nshoot.” Viewing a black individual evokes less of an N200 waveform\nthan does seeing someone white. The greater the P200/N200 ratio (i.e.,\nthe greater the ratio of I’m-feeling-threatened to Hold-on-a-sec), the\ngreater the likelihood of shooting an unarmed black individual. In\nanother study subjects had to identify fragmented pictures of objects.\nPriming white subjects with subliminal views of black (but not white)\nfaces made them better at detecting pictures of weapons (but not cameras\nor books).14\nFinally, for the same criminal conviction, the more stereotypically\nAfrican a black individual’s facial features, the longer the sentence.15 In\ncontrast, juries view black (but not white) male defendants more\nfavorably if they’re wearing big, clunky glasses; some defense attorneys\neven exploit this “nerd defense” by accessorizing their clients with fake\nglasses, and prosecuting attorneys ask whether those dorky glasses are\nreal. In other words, when blind, impartial justice is supposedly being\nadministered, jurors are unconsciously biased by racial stereotypes of\nsomeone’s face.\nThis is so depressing—are we hardwired to fear the face of someone\nof another race, to process their face less as a face, to feel less empathy?\nNo. For starters, there’s tremendous individual variation—not everyone’s\namygdala activates in response to an other-race face, and those\nexceptions are informative. Moreover, subtle manipulations rapidly\nsensory way station in the thalamus and then to appropriate cortical\nregion (e.g., the visual or auditory cortex) for the slow, arduous process\nof decoding light pixels, sound waves, and so on into something\nidentifiable. And finally information about it (“It’s Mozart”) is passed to\nthe limbic system.\nAs we saw, there’s that shortcut from the thalamus directly to the\namygdala, such that while the first few layers of, say, the visual cortex\nare futzing around with unpacking a complex image, the amygdala is\nalready thinking, “That’s a gun!” and reacting. And as we saw, there’s\nthe trade-off: information reaches the amygdala fast but is often\ninaccurate.16 The amygdala thinks it knows what it’s seeing before the\nfrontal cortex slams on the brakes; an innocent man reaches for his\nwallet and dies.\nOther types of subliminal visual information influence the brain.17\nFor example, the gender of a face is processed within 150 milliseconds.\nDitto with social status. Social dominance looks the same across cultures\n—direct gaze, open posture (e.g., leaning back with arms behind the\nhead), while subordination is signaled with averted gaze, arms sheltering\nthe torso. After a mere 40-millisecond exposure, subjects accurately\ndistinguish high- from low-status presentations. As we’ll see in chapter\n12, when people are figuring out stable status relations, logical areas of\nthe frontal cortex (the vmPFC and dlPFC) activate; but in the case of\nunstable, flip-flopping relations, the amygdala also activates. It’s\nunsettling when we’re unsure who gets ulcers and who gives them.\nThere’s also subliminal cuing about beauty.18 From an early age, in\nboth sexes and across cultures, attractive people are judged to be smarter,\nkinder, and more honest. We’re more likely to vote for attractive people\nor hire them, less likely to convict them of crimes, and, if they are\nconvicted, more likely to dole out shorter sentences. Remarkably, the\nmedial orbitofrontal cortex assesses both the beauty of a face and the\ngoodness of a behavior, and its level of activity during one of those tasks\npredicts the level during the other. The brain does similar things when\ncontemplating beautiful minds, hearts, and cheekbones. And assumes\nfusiform? The shape of women’s faces changes subtly during their\novulatory cycle, and men prefer female faces at the time of ovulation.\nSubjects guess political affiliation or religion at above-chance levels just\nby looking at faces. And for the same transgression, people who look\nembarrassed—blushing, eyes averted, face angled downward and to the\nside—are more readily forgiven.\nEyes give the most information.20 Take pictures of two faces with\ndifferent emotions, and switch different facial parts between the two with\ncutting and pasting. What emotion is detected? The one in the eyes.*21\nEyes often have an implicit censorious power.22 Post a large picture\nof a pair of eyes at a bus stop (versus a picture of flowers), and people\nbecome more likely to clean up litter. Post a picture of eyes in a\nworkplace coffee room, and the money paid on the honor system triples.\nShow a pair of eyes on a computer screen and people become more\ngenerous in online economic games.\nSubliminal auditory cues also alter behavior.23 Back to amygdaloid\nactivation in whites subliminally viewing black faces. Chad Forbes of\nthe University of Delaware shows that the amygdala activation increases\nif loud rap music—a genre typically associated more with African\nAmericans than with whites—plays in the background. The opposite\noccurs when evoking negative white stereotypes with death metal music\nblaring.\nAnother example of auditory cuing explains a thoroughly poignant\nanecdote told by my Stanford colleague Claude Steele, who has done\nseminal research on stereotyping.24 Steele recounts how an African\nAmerican male grad student of his, knowing the stereotypes that a young\nblack man evokes on the genteel streets of Palo Alto, whistled Vivaldi\nwhen walking home at night, hoping to evoke instead “Hey, that’s not\nSnoop Dogg. That’s a dead white male composer [exhale].”\nNo discussion of subliminal sensory cuing is complete without\nconsidering olfaction, a subject marketing people have salivated over\nsince we were projected to watch Smell-O-Vision someday. The human\nolfactory system is atrophied; roughly 40 percent of a rat’s brain is\ndevoted to olfactory processing, versus 3 percent in us. Nonetheless, we\nphysiology and behavior. Similar, if milder, versions of the same are\nreported in some (but not all) studies of humans, ranging from the\nWellesley effect, discussed in the introduction, to heterosexual women\npreferring the smell of high-testosterone men.\nImportantly, pheromones signal fear. In one study researchers got\narmpit swabs from volunteers under two conditions—either after\ncontentedly sweating during a comfortable run, or after sweating in\nterror during their first tandem skydive (note—in tandem skydives\nyou’re yoked to the instructor, who does the physical work; so if you’re\nsweating, it’s from panic, not physical effort). Subjects sniffed each type\nof sweat and couldn’t consciously distinguish between them. However,\nsniffing terrified sweat (but not contented sweat) caused amygdaloid\nactivation, a bigger startle response, improved detection of subliminal\nangry faces, and increased odds of interpreting an ambiguous face as\nlooking fearful. If people around you smell scared, your brain tilts\ntoward concluding that you are too.25\nFinally, nonpheromonal odors influence us as well. As we’ll see in\nchapter 12, if people sit in a room with smelly garbage, they become\nmore conservative about social issues (e.g., gay marriage) without\nchanging their opinions about, say, foreign policy or economics.\nInteroceptive Information\nIn addition to information about the outside world, our brains\nconstantly receive “interoceptive” information about the body’s internal\nstate. You feel hungry, your back aches, your gassy intestine twinges,\nyour big toe itches. And such interoceptive information influences our\nbehavior as well.\nThis brings us to the time-honored James-Lange theory, named for\nWilliam James, a grand mufti in the history of psychology, and an\nobscure Danish physician, Carl Lange. In the 1880s they independently\nconcocted the same screwy idea. How do your feelings and your body’s\nautomatic (i.e., “autonomic”) function interact? It seems obvious—a lion\nchases you, you feel terrified, and thus your heart speeds up. James and\nbody.\nThere’s support for the idea—three of my favorites are that (a)\nforcing depressed people to smile makes them feel better; (b) instructing\npeople to take on a more “dominant” posture makes them feel more so\n(lowers stress hormone levels); and (c) muscle relaxants decrease anxiety\n(“Things are still awful, but if my muscles are so relaxed that I’m\ndribbling out of this chair, things must be improving”). Nonetheless, a\nstrict version of James-Lange doesn’t work, because of the issue of\nspecificity—hearts race for varying reasons, so how does your brain\ndecide if it’s reacting to a lion or an exciting come-hither look?\nMoreover, many autonomic responses are too slow to precede conscious\nawareness of an emotion.26\nNonetheless, interoceptive information influences, if not determines,\nour emotions. Some brain regions with starring roles in processing social\nemotions—the PFC, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and\namygdala—receive lots of interoceptive information. This helps explain\na reliable trigger of aggression, namely pain, which activates most of\nthose regions. As a repeating theme, pain does not cause aggression; it\namplifies preexisting tendencies toward aggression. In other words, pain\nmakes aggressive people more aggressive, while doing the opposite to\nunaggressive individuals.27\nInteroceptive information can alter behavior more subtly than in the\npain/aggression link.28 One example concerns how much the frontal\ncortex has to do with willpower, harking back to material covered in the\nlast chapter. Various studies, predominantly by Roy Baumeister of\nFlorida State University, show that when the frontal cortex labors hard\non some cognitive task, immediately afterward individuals are more\naggressive and less empathic, charitable, and honest. Metaphorically, the\nfrontal cortex says, “Screw it. I’m tired and don’t feel like thinking about\nmy fellow human.”\nThis seems related to the metabolic costs of the frontal cortex doing\nthe harder thing. During frontally demanding tasks, blood glucose levels\ndrop, and frontal function improves if subjects are given a sugary drink\n(with control subjects consuming a drink with a nonnutritive sugar\nself-control or impaired motivation for it. But either way, over the course\nof seconds to minutes, the amount of energy reaching the brain and the\namount of energy the frontal cortex needs have something to do with\nwhether the harder, more correct thing happens.\nThus, sensory information streaming toward your brain from both the\noutside world and your body can rapidly, powerfully, and automatically\nalter behavior. In the minutes before our prototypical behavior occurs,\nmore complex stimuli influence us as well.\nUnconscious Language Effects\nWords have power. They can save, cure, uplift, devastate, deflate,\nand kill. And unconscious priming with words influences pro- and\nantisocial behaviors.\nOne of my favorite examples concerns the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the\neconomic game where participants decide whether to cooperate or\ncompete at various junctures.29 And behavior is altered by “situational\nlabels”—call the game the “Wall Street Game,” and people become less\ncooperative. Calling it the “Community Game” does the opposite.\nSimilarly, have subjects read seemingly random word lists before\nplaying. Embedding warm fuzzy prosocial words in the list—“help,”\n“harmony,” “fair,” “mutual”—fosters cooperation, while words like\n“rank,” “power,” “fierce,” and “inconsiderate” foster the opposite. Mind\nyou, this isn’t subjects reading either Christ’s Sermon on the Mount or\nAyn Rand. Just an innocuous string of words. Words unconsciously shift\nthoughts and feelings. One person’s “terrorist” is another’s “freedom\nfighter”; politicians jockey to commandeer “family values,” and\nsomehow you can’t favor both “choice” and “life.”*30\nThere are more examples. In Nobel Prize–winning research, Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously showed word framing altering\ndecision making. Subjects decide whether to administer a hypothetical\ndrug. If they’re told, “The drug has a 95 percent survival rate,” people,\nincluding doctors, are more likely to approve it than when told, “The\ngames.32\nVerbal primes also impact moral decision making.33 As every trial\nlawyer knows, juries decide differently depending on how colorfully you\ndescribe someone’s act. Neuroimaging studies show that more colorful\nwording engages the anterior cingulate more. Moreover, people judge\nmoral transgressions more harshly when they are described as “wrong”\nor “inappropriate” (versus “forbidden” or “blameworthy”).\nEven Subtler Types of Unconscious Cuing\nIn the minutes before a behavior is triggered, subtler things than\nsights and smells, gas pain, and choice of words unconsciously influence\nus.\nIn one study, subjects filling out a questionnaire expressed stronger\negalitarian principles if there was an American flag in the room. In a\nstudy of spectators at English football matches, a researcher planted in\nthe crowd slips, seemingly injuring his ankle. Does anyone help him? If\nthe plant wore the home team’s sweatshirt, he received more help than\nwhen he wore a neutral sweatshirt or one of the opposing team. Another\nstudy involved a subtle group-membership manipulation—for a number\nof days, pairs of conservatively dressed Hispanics stood at train stations\nduring rush hour in predominately white Boston suburbs, conversing\nquietly in Spanish. The consequence? White commuters expressed more\nnegative, exclusionary attitudes toward Hispanic (but not other)\nimmigrants.34\nCuing about group membership is complicated by people belonging\nto multiple groups. Consider a famous study of Asian American women\nwho took a math test.35 Everyone knows that women are worse at math\nthan men (we’ll see in chapter 9 how that’s not really so) and Asian\nAmericans are better at it than other Americans. Subjects primed\nbeforehand to think about their racial identity performed better than did\nthose primed to think about their gender.\nAnother realm of rapid group influences on behavior is usually\nher shrieks for help and didn’t bother calling the police. Despite that\nbeing reported by the New York Times, and the collective indifference\nbecoming emblematic of all that’s wrong with people, the facts differed:\nthe number was less than thirty-eight, no one witnessed the entire event,\napartment windows were closed on that winter’s night, and most\nassumed they were hearing the muffled sounds of a lover’s quarrel.*\nThe mythic elements of the Genovese case prompt the quasi myth\nthat in an emergency requiring brave intervention, the more people\npresent, the less likely anyone is to help—“There’s lots of people here;\nsomeone else will step forward.” The bystander effect does occur in\nnondangerous situations, where the price of stepping forward is\ninconvenience. However, in dangerous situations, the more people\npresent, the more likely individuals are to step forward. Why? Perhaps\nelements of reputation, where a larger crowd equals more witnesses to\none’s heroics.\nAnother rapid social-context effect shows men in some of their\nlamest moments.37 Specifically, when women are present, or when men\nare prompted to think about women, they become more risk-taking, show\nsteeper temporal discounting in economic decisions, and spend more on\nluxury items (but not on mundane expenses).* Moreover, the allure of\nthe opposite sex makes men more aggressive—for example, more likely\nin a competitive game to punish the opposing guy with loud blasts of\nnoise. Crucially, this is not inevitable—in circumstances where status is\nachieved through prosocial routes, the presence of women makes men\nmore prosocial. As summarized in the title of one paper demonstrating\nthis, this seems a case of “Male generosity as a mating signal.” We’ll\nreturn to this theme in the next chapter.\nThus, our social environment unconsciously shapes our behavior\nover the course of minutes. As does our physical environment.\nNow we come to the “broken window” theory of crime of James Q.\nWilson and George Kelling.38 They proposed that small signs of urban\ndisarray—litter, graffiti, broken windows, public drunkenness—form a\nslippery slope leading to larger signs of disarray, leading to increased\ncrime. Why? Because litter and graffiti as the norm mean people don’t\nPolice commissioner William Bratton instituted a zero-tolerance policy\ntoward minor infractions—targeting subway fare evaders, graffiti artists,\nvandals, beggars, and the city’s maddening infestation of squeegee men.\nWhich was followed by a steep drop in rates of serious crime. Similar\nresults occurred elsewhere; in Lowell, Massachusetts, zero-tolerance\nmeasures were experimentally applied in only one part of the city;\nserious crime dropped only in that area. Critics questioned whether the\nbenefits of broken-window policing were inflated, given that the\napproach was tested when crime was already declining throughout the\nUnited States (in other words, in contrast to the commendable Lowell\nexample, studies often lacked control groups).\nIn a test of the theory, Kees Keizer of the University of Groningen in\nthe Netherlands asked whether cues of one type of norm violation made\npeople prone to violating other norms.39 When bicycles were chained to\na fence (despite a sign forbidding it), people were more likely to take a\nshortcut through a gap in the fence (despite a sign forbidding it); people\nlittered more when walls were graffitied; people were more likely to\nsteal a five-euro note when litter was strewn around. These were big\neffects, with doubling rates of crummy behaviors. A norm violation\nincreasing the odds of that same norm being violated is a conscious\nprocess. But when the sound of fireworks makes someone more likely to\nlitter, more unconscious processes are at work.\nA Wonderfully Complicating Piece of the Story\nWe’ve now seen how sensory and interoceptive information\ninfluence the brain to produce a behavior within seconds to minutes. But\nas a complication, the brain can alter the sensitivity of those sensory\nmodalities, making some stimuli more influential.\nAs an obvious one, dogs prick up their ears when they’re alert—the\nbrain has stimulated ear muscles in a way that enables the ears to more\neasily detect sounds, which then influences the brain.40 During acute\nstress, all of our sensory systems become more sensitive. More\nactivate particular hypothalamic neurons. These, in turn, project to and\nstimulate receptor neurons in the nose that respond to food smells. The\nstimulation isn’t enough to give those receptor neurons action potentials,\nbut it now takes fewer food odorant molecules to trigger one. Something\nalong these lines explains how the brain alters the selective sensitivity of\nsensory systems.\nThis certainly applies to the behaviors that fill this book. Recall how\neyes carry lots of information about emotional state. It turns out that the\nbrain biases us toward preferentially looking at eyes. This was shown by\nDamasio, studying a patient with Urbach-Wiethe disease, which\nselectively destroys the amygdala. As expected, she was poor at\naccurately detecting fearful faces. But in addition, while control subjects\nspent about half their face-gazing time looking at eyes, she spent half\nthat. When instructed to focus on the eyes, she improved at recognizing\nfearful expressions. Thus, not only does the amygdala detect fearful\nfaces, but it also biases us toward obtaining information about fearful\nfaces.41\nPsychopaths are typically poor at recognizing fearful expressions\n(though they accurately recognize other types).42 They also look less at\neyes than normal and improve at fear recognition when directed to focus\non eyes. This makes sense, given the amygdaloid abnormalities in\npsychopaths noted in chapter 2.\nNow an example foreshadowing chapter 9’s focus on culture. Show\nsubjects a picture of an object embedded in a complex background.\nWithin seconds, people from collectivist cultures (e.g., China) tend to\nlook more at, and remember better, the surrounding “contextual”\ninformation, while people from individualistic cultures (e.g., the United\nStates) do the same with the focal object. Instruct subjects to focus on the\ndomain that their culture doesn’t gravitate toward, and there’s frontal\no brain operates in a vacuum, and over the course of seconds to\nminutes, the wealth of information streaming into the brain\ninfluences the likelihood of pro- or antisocial acts. As we’ve seen,\npertinent information ranges from something as simple and\nunidimensional as shirt color to things as complex and subtle as cues\nabout ideology. Moreover, the brain also constantly receives\ninteroceptive information. And most important, much of these varied\ntypes of information is subliminal. Ultimately, the most important point\nof this chapter is that in the moments just before we decide upon some of"

    "content": "Hours to Days Before\ne now take the next step back in our chronology, considering\nevents from hours to days before a behavior occurs. To do so,\nwe enter the realm of hormones. What are the effects of hormones on the\nbrain and sensory systems that filled the last two chapters? How do\nhormones influence our best and worst behaviors?\nWhile this chapter examines various hormones, the most attention is\npaid to one inextricably tied to aggression, namely testosterone. And as\nthe punch line, testosterone is far less relevant to aggression than usually\nassumed. At the other end of the spectrum, the chapter also considers a\nhormone with cult status for fostering warm, fuzzy prosociality, namely\noxytocin. As we’ll see, it’s not quite as groovy as assumed.\nestosterone is secreted by the testes as the final step in the\n“hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular” axis; it has effects on cells\nthroughout the body (including neurons, of course). And testosterone is\neveryone’s usual suspect when it comes to the hormonal causes of\naggression.\nCorrelation and Causality\nWhy is it that throughout the animal kingdom, and in every human\nculture, males account for most aggression and violence? Well, what\nabout testosterone and some related hormones (collectively called\n“androgens,” a term that, unless otherwise noted, I will use simplistically\nas synonymous with “testosterone”)? In nearly all species males have\nmore circulating testosterone than do females (who secrete small\namounts of androgens from the adrenal glands). Moreover, male\naggression is most prevalent when testosterone levels are highest\n(adolescence, and during mating season in seasonal breeders).\nThus, testosterone and aggression are linked. Furthermore, there are\nparticularly high levels of testosterone receptors in the amygdala, in the\nway station by which it projects to the rest of the brain (the bed nucleus\nof the stria terminalis), and in its major targets (the hypothalamus, the\ncentral gray of the midbrain, and the frontal cortex). But these are merely\ncorrelative data. Showing that testosterone causes aggression requires a\n“subtraction” plus a “replacement” experiment. Subtraction—castrate a\nmale. Do levels of aggression decrease? Yes (including in humans). This\nshows that something coming from the testes causes aggression. Is it\ntestosterone? Replacement—give that castrated individual replacement\ntestosterone. Do precastration levels of aggression return? Yes (including\nin humans).\nThus, testosterone causes aggression. Time to see how wrong that is.\nmaintain the aggression. But no—even when testosterone and androgens\nare completely eliminated, some aggression remains. Thus, some male\naggression is testosterone independent.*\nThis point is driven home by castration of some sexual offenders, a\nlegal procedure in a few states.1 This is accomplished with “chemical\ncastration,” administration of drugs that either inhibit testosterone\nproduction or block testosterone receptors.* Castration decreases sexual\nurges in the subset of sex offenders with intense, obsessive, and\npathological urges. But otherwise castration doesn’t decrease recidivism\nrates; as stated in one meta-analysis, “hostile rapists and those who\ncommit sex crimes motivated by power or anger are not amenable to\ntreatment with [the antiandrogenic drugs].”\nThis leads to a hugely informative point: the more experience a male\nhad being aggressive prior to castration, the more aggression continues\nafterward. In other words, the less his being aggressive in the future\nrequires testosterone and the more it’s a function of social learning.\nOn to the next issue that lessens the primacy of testosterone: What do\nindividual levels of testosterone have to do with aggression? If one\nperson has higher testosterone levels than another, or higher levels this\nweek than last, are they more likely to be aggressive?\nInitially the answer seemed to be yes, as studies showed correlation\nbetween individual differences in testosterone levels and levels of\naggression. In a typical study, higher testosterone levels would be\nobserved in those male prisoners with higher rates of aggression. But\nbeing aggressive stimulates testosterone secretion; no wonder more\naggressive individuals had higher levels. Such studies couldn’t\ndisentangle chickens and eggs.\nThus, a better question is whether differences in testosterone levels\namong individuals predict who will be aggressive. And among birds,\nfish, mammals, and especially other primates, the answer is generally no.\nThis has been studied extensively in humans, examining a variety of\nmeasures of aggression. And the answer is clear. To quote the British\nendocrinologist John Archer in a definitive 2006 review, “There is a\nweak and inconsistent association between testosterone levels and\n(Things differ when levels are made “supraphysiological”—higher\nthan the body normally generates. This is the world of athletes and\nbodybuilders abusing high-dose testosterone-like anabolic steroids; in\nthat situation risk of aggression does increase. Two complications: it’s\nnot random who would choose to take these drugs, and abusers are often\nalready predisposed toward aggression; supraphysiological levels of\nandrogens generate anxiety and paranoia, and increased aggression may\nbe secondary to that.)3\nThus, aggression is typically more about social learning than about\ntestosterone, and differing levels of testosterone generally can’t explain\nwhy some individuals are more aggressive than others. So what does\ntestosterone actually do to behavior?\nSubtleties of Testosterone Effects\nWhen looking at faces expressing strong emotions, we tend to make\nmicroexpressions that mimic them; testosterone decreases such empathic\nmimicry.*4 Moreover, testosterone makes people less adept at identifying\nemotions by looking at people’s eyes, and faces of strangers activate the\namygdala more than familiar ones and are rated as less trustworthy.\nTestosterone also increases confidence and optimism, while\ndecreasing fear and anxiety.5 This explains the “winner” effect in lab\nanimals, where winning a fight increases an animal’s willingness to\nparticipate in, and its success in, another such interaction. Part of the\nincreased success probably reflects the fact that winning stimulates\ntestosterone secretion, which increases glucose delivery and metabolism\nin the animal’s muscles and makes his pheromones smell scarier.\nMoreover, winning increases the number of testosterone receptors in the\nbed nucleus of the stria terminalis (the way station through which the\namygdala communicates with the rest of the brain), increasing its\nsensitivity to the hormone. Success in everything from athletics to chess\nto the stock market boosts testosterone levels.\nConfident and optimistic. Well, endless self-help books urge us to be\nand to ignore input from their partner. Testosterone makes people cocky,\negocentric, and narcissistic.6\nTestosterone boosts impulsivity and risk taking, making people do\nthe easier thing when it’s the dumb-ass thing to do.7 Testosterone does\nthis by decreasing activity in the prefrontal cortex and its functional\ncoupling to the amygdala and increasing amygdaloid coupling with the\nthalamus—the source of that shortcut path of sensory information into\nthe amygdala. Thus, more influence by split-second, low-accuracy inputs\nand less by the let’s-stop-and-think-about-this frontal cortex.\nBeing fearless, overconfident, and delusionally optimistic sure feels\ngood. No surprise, then, that testosterone can be pleasurable. Rats will\nwork (by pressing levers) to be infused with testosterone and show\n“conditioned place preference,” returning to a random corner of the cage\nwhere infusions occur. “I don’t know why, but I feel good whenever I\nstand there.”8,9\nThe underlying neurobiology fits perfectly. Dopamine is needed for\nplace-preference conditioning to occur, and testosterone increases\nactivity in the ventral tegmentum, the source of those mesolimbic and\nmesocortical dopamine projections. Moreover, conditioned place\npreference is induced when testosterone is infused directly into the\nnucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmentum’s main projection target.\nWhen a rat wins a fight, the number of testosterone receptors increases in\nthe ventral tegmentum and accumbens, increasing sensitivity to the\nhormone’s feel-good effects.10\nSo testosterone does subtle things to behavior. Nonetheless, this\ndoesn’t tell us much because everything can be interpreted every which\nway. Testosterone increases anxiety—you feel threatened and become\nmore reactively aggressive. Testosterone decreases anxiety—you feel\ncocky and overconfident, become more preemptively aggressive.\nTestosterone increases risk taking—“Hey, let’s gamble and invade.”\nTestosterone increases risk taking—“Hey, let’s gamble and make a peace\noffer.” Testosterone makes you feel good—“Let’s start another fight,\nsince the last one went swell.” Testosterone makes you feel good\n—“Let’s all hold hands.”\ntestosterone amplifies the power of something else to cause X.\nA classic example comes from a 1977 study of groups of male\ntalapoin monkeys.11 Testosterone was administered to the middle-\nranking male in each group (say, rank number 3 out of five), increasing\ntheir levels of aggression. Does this mean that these guys, stoked on\n’roids, started challenging numbers 1 and 2 in the hierarchy? No. They\nbecame aggressive jerks to poor numbers 4 and 5. Testosterone did not\ncreate new social patterns of aggression; it exaggerated preexisting ones.\nIn human studies testosterone didn’t raise baseline activity in the\namygdala; it boosted the amygdala’s response and heart-rate reactivity to\nangry faces (but not to happy or neutral ones). Similarly, testosterone did\nnot make subjects more selfish and uncooperative in an economic game;\nit made them more punitive when provoked by being treated poorly,\nenhancing “vengeful reactive aggression.”12\nThe context dependency also occurs on the neurobiological level, in\nthat the hormone shortens the refractory period of neurons in the\namygdala and amygdaloid targets in the hypothalamus.13 Recall that the\nrefractory period comes in neurons after action potentials. This is when\nthe neuron’s resting potential is hyperpolarized (i.e., when it is more\nnegatively charged than usual), making the neuron less excitable,\nproducing a period of silence after the action potential. Thus, shorter\nrefractory periods mean a higher rate of action potentials. So is\ntestosterone causing action potentials in these neurons? No. It’s causing\nthem to fire at a faster rate if they are stimulated by something else.\nSimilarly, testosterone increases amygdala response to angry faces, but\nnot to other sorts. Thus, if the amygdala is already responding to some\nrealm of social learning, testosterone ups the volume.\nA Key Synthesis: The Challenge Hypothesis\nThus, testosterone’s actions are contingent and amplifying,\nexacerbating preexisting tendencies toward aggression rather than\ncreating aggression out of thin air. This picture inspired the “challenge\ntime of a challenge. Which is precisely how things work.\nThe explains why basal levels of testosterone have little to do with\nsubsequent aggression, and why increases in testosterone due to puberty,\nsexual stimulation, or the start of mating season don’t increase\naggression either.15\nBut things are different during challenges.16 Among various\nprimates, testosterone levels rise when a dominance hierarchy first forms\nor undergoes reorganization. Testosterone rises in humans in both\nindividual and team sports competition, including basketball, wrestling,\ntennis, rugby, and judo; there’s generally a rise in anticipation of the\nevent and a larger one afterward, especially among winners.*\nRemarkably, watching your favorite team win raises testosterone levels,\nshowing that the rise is less about muscle activity than about the\npsychology of dominance, identification, and self-esteem.\nMost important, the rise in testosterone after a challenge makes\naggression more likely.17 Think about this. Testosterone levels rise,\nreaching the brain. If this occurs because someone is challenging you,\nyou head in the direction of aggression. If an identical rise occurs\nbecause days are lengthening and mating season is approaching, you\ndecide to fly a thousand miles to your breeding grounds. And if the same\noccurs because of puberty, you get stupid and giggly around that girl\nwho plays clarinet in the band. The context dependency is\nremarkable.*18\nThe challenge hypothesis has a second part to it. When testosterone\nrises after a challenge, it doesn’t prompt aggression. Instead it prompts\nwhatever behaviors are needed to maintain status. This changes things\nenormously.\nWell, maybe not, since maintaining status for, say, male primates\nconsists mostly of aggression or threats of it—from slashing your\nopponent to giving a “You have no idea who you’re screwing with”\nstare.19\nAnd now for some flabbergastingly important research. What\nhappens if defending your status requires you to be nice? This was\nexplored in a study by Christoph Eisenegger and Ernst Fehr of the\nwhen someone’s offer is rejected, they feel dissed, subordinated,\nespecially if news of that carries into future rounds with other players. In\nother words, in this scenario status and reputation rest on being fair.\nAnd what happens when subjects were given testosterone\nbeforehand? People made more generous offers. What the hormone\nmakes you do depends on what counts as being studly. This requires\nsome fancy neuroendocrine wiring that is sensitive to social learning.\nYou couldn’t ask for a finding more counter to testosterone’s reputation.\nThe study contained a slick additional finding that further separated\ntestosterone myth from reality. As per usual, subjects got either\ntestosterone or saline, without knowing which. Subjects who believed it\nwas testosterone (independent of whether it actually was) made less\ngenerous offers. In other words, testosterone doesn’t necessarily make\nyou behave in a crappy manner, but believing that it does and that you’re\ndrowning in the stuff makes you behave in a crappy manner.\nAdditional studies show that testosterone promotes prosociality in the\nright setting. In one, under circumstances where someone’s sense of\npride rides on honesty, testosterone decreased men’s cheating in a game.\nIn another, subjects decided how much of a sum of money they would\nkeep and how much they would publicly contribute to a common pool\nshared by all the players; testosterone made most subjects more\nprosocial.21\nWhat does this mean? Testosterone makes us more willing to do\nwhat it takes to attain and maintain status. And the key point is what it\ntakes. Engineer social circumstances right, and boosting testosterone\nlevels during a challenge would make people compete like crazy to do\nthe most acts of random kindness. In our world riddled with male\nviolence, the problem isn’t that testosterone can increase levels of\nMARKETING DREAM\nf the point of the preceding section is that testosterone has gotten a\nbum rap, the point of this one is that oxytocin (and the closely related\nvasopressin) is coasting in a Teflon presidency. According to lore,\noxytocin makes organisms less aggressive, more socially attuned,\ntrusting, and empathic. Individuals treated with oxytocin become more\nfaithful partners and more attentive parents. It makes lab rats more\ncharitable and better listeners, makes fruit flies sing like Joan Baez.\nNaturally, things are more complicated, and oxytocin has an informative\ndark side.\nBasics\nOxytocin and vasopressin are chemically similar hormones; the DNA\nsequences that constitute their genes are similar, and the two genes occur\nclose to each other on the same chromosome. There was a single\nancestral gene that, a few hundred million years ago, was accidentally\n“duplicated” in the genome, and the DNA sequences in the two copies of\nthe gene drifted independently, evolving into two closely related genes\n(stay tuned for more in chapter 8). This gene duplication occurred as\nmammals were emerging; other vertebrates have only the ancestral\nversion, called vasotocin, which is structurally between the two separate\nmammalian hormones.\nFor twentieth-century neurobiologists, oxytocin and vasopressin\nwere pretty boring. They were made in hypothalamic neurons that sent\naxons to the posterior pituitary. There they would be released into\ncirculation, thereby attaining hormone status, and have nothing to do\nwith the brain ever again. Oxytocin stimulated uterine contraction during\nlabor and milk letdown afterward. Vasopressin (aka “antidiuretic\nhormone”) regulated water retention in the kidneys. And reflecting their\nhypothalamic neurons that made oxytocin and vasopressin also sent\nprojections throughout the brain, including the dopamine-related ventral\ntegmentum and nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal\ncortex, all regions with ample levels of receptors for the hormones.\nMoreover, oxytocin and vasopressin turned out to be synthesized and\nsecreted elsewhere in the brain. These two boring, classical peripheral\nhormones affected brain function and behavior. They started being called\n“neuropeptides”—neuroactive messengers with a peptide structure—\nwhich is a fancy way of saying they are small proteins (and, to avoid\nwriting “oxytocin and vasopressin” endlessly, I will refer to them as\nneuropeptides; note though that there are other neuropeptides).\nThe initial findings about their behavioral effects made sense.22\nOxytocin prepares the body of a female mammal for birth and lactation;\nlogically, oxytocin also facilitates maternal behavior. The brain boosts\noxytocin production when a female rat gives birth, thanks to a\nhypothalamic circuit with markedly different functions in females and\nmales. Moreover, the ventral tegmentum increases its sensitivity to the\nneuropeptide by increasing levels of oxytocin receptors. Infuse oxytocin\ninto the brain of a virgin rat, and she’ll act maternally—retrieving,\ngrooming, and licking pups. Block the actions of oxytocin in a rodent\nmother,*23 and she’ll stop maternal behaviors, including nursing.\nOxytocin works in the olfactory system, helping a new mom learn the\nsmell of her offspring. Meanwhile, vasopressin has similar but milder\neffects.\nSoon other species were heard from. Oxytocin lets sheep learn the\nsmell of their offspring and facilitates female monkeys grooming their\noffspring. Spray oxytocin up a woman’s nose (a way to get the\nneuropeptide past the blood-brain barrier and into the brain), and she’ll\nfind babies to look more appealing. Moreover, women with variants of\ngenes that produce higher levels of oxytocin or oxytocin receptors\naverage higher levels of touching their infants and more synchronized\ngazing with them.\nSo oxytocin is central to female mammals nursing, wanting to nurse\nmonkeys, experienced fathers have more dendrites in frontal cortical\nneurons containing vasopressin receptors. Moreover, administering\nvasopressin enhances paternal behaviors. However, an ethological\ncaveat: this occurs only in species where males are paternal (e.g., prairie\nvoles and marmoset monkeys).24*\nThen, dozens of millions of years ago, some rodent and primate\nspecies independently evolved monogamous pair-bonding, along with\nthe neuropeptides central to the process.25 Among marmoset and titi\nmonkeys, which both pair-bond, oxytocin strengthens the bond,\nincreasing a monkey’s preference for huddling with her partner over\nhuddling with a stranger. Then there was a study that is embarrassingly\nsimilar to stereotypical human couples. Among pair-bonding tamarin\nmonkeys, lots of grooming and physical contact predicted high oxytocin\nlevels in female members of a pair. What predicted high levels of\noxytocin in males? Lots of sex.\nBeautiful, pioneering work by Thomas Insel of the National Institute\nof Mental Health, Larry Young of Emory University, and Sue Carter of\nthe University of Illinois has made a species of vole arguably the most\ncelebrated rodent on earth.26 Most voles (e.g., montane voles) are\npolygamous. In contrast, prairie voles, in a salute to Garrison Keillor,\nform monogamous mating pairs for life. Naturally, this isn’t quite the\ncase—while they are “social pair-bonders” with their permanent\nrelationships, they’re not quite perfect “sexual pair-bonders,” as males\nmight mess around on the side. Nonetheless, prairie voles pair-bond\nmore than other voles, prompting Insel, Young, and Carter to figure out\nwhy.\nFirst finding: sex releases oxytocin and vasopressin in the nucleus\naccumbens of female and male voles, respectively. Obvious theory:\nprairie voles release more of the stuff during sex than do polygamous\nvoles, causing a more rewarding buzz, encouraging the individuals to\nstick with their partner. But prairie voles don’t release more\nneuropeptides than montane voles. Instead, prairie voles have more of\nthe pertinent receptors in the nucleus accumbens than do polygamous\nvoles.* Moreover, male prairie voles with a variant of the vasopressin\nthey groomed and huddled more with familiar females (but not with\nstrangers). Then the scientists engineered the brains of male montane\nvoles to have more vasopressin receptors in the nucleus accumbens; the\nmales became more socially affiliative with individual females.*\nWhat about versions of vasopressin receptor genes in other species?\nWhen compared with chimps, bonobos have a variant associated with\nmore receptor expression and far more social bonding between females\nand males (although, in contrast to prairie voles, bonobos are anything\nbut monogamous).27\nHow about humans? This is tough to study, because you can’t\nmeasure these neuropeptides in tiny brain regions in humans and instead\nhave to examine levels in the circulation, a fairly indirect measure.\nNevertheless, these neuropeptides appear to play a role in human\npair-bonding.28 For starters, circulating oxytocin levels are elevated in\ncouples when they’ve first hooked up. Furthermore, the higher the levels,\nthe more physical affection, the more behaviors are synchronized, the\nmore long-lasting the relationship, and the happier interviewers rate\ncouples to be.\nEven more interesting were studies where oxytocin (or a control\nspray) was administered intranasally. In one fun study, couples had to\ndiscuss one of their conflicts; oxytocin up their noses, and they’d be\nrated as communicating more positively and would secrete less stress\nhormones. Another study suggests that oxytocin unconsciously\nstrengthens the pair-bond. Heterosexual male volunteers, with or without\nan oxytocin spritz, interacted with an attractive female researcher, doing\nsome nonsense task. Among men in stable relationships, oxytocin\nincreased their distance from the woman an average of four to six inches.\nSingle guys, no effect. (Why didn’t oxytocin make them stand closer?\nThe researchers indicated that they were already about as close as one\ncould get away with.) If the experimenter was male, no effect. Moreover,\noxytocin caused males in relationships to spend less time looking at\npictures of attractive women. Importantly, oxytocin didn’t make men rate\nthese women as less attractive; they were simply less interested.29\nThus, oxytocin and vasopressin facilitate bonding between parent\noxytocin: when a dog and its owner (but not a stranger) interact, they\nsecrete oxytocin.30 The more of that time is spent gazing at each other,\nthe bigger the rise. Give dogs oxytocin, and they gaze longer at their\nhumans . . . which raises the humans’ oxytocin levels. So a hormone that\nevolved for mother-infant bonding plays a role in this bizarre,\nunprecedented form of bonding between species.\nIn line with its effects on bonding, oxytocin inhibits the central\namygdala, suppresses fear and anxiety, and activates the “calm,\nvegetative” parasympathetic nervous system. Moreover, people with an\noxytocin receptor gene variant associated with more sensitive parenting\nalso have less of a cardiovascular startle response. In the words of Sue\nCarter, exposure to oxytocin is “a physiological metaphor for safety.”\nFurthermore, oxytocin reduces aggression in rodents, and mice whose\noxytocin system was silenced (by deleting the gene for oxytocin or its\nreceptor) were abnormally aggressive.31\nOther studies showed that people rate faces as more trustworthy, and\nare more trusting in economic games, when given oxytocin (oxytocin\nhad no effect when someone thought they were playing with a computer,\nshowing that this was about social behavior).32 This increased trust was\ninteresting. Normally, if the other player does something duplicitous in\nthe game, subjects are less trusting in subsequent rounds; in contrast,\noxytocin-treated investors didn’t modify their behavior in this way.\nStated scientifically, “oxytocin inoculated betrayal aversion among\ninvestors”; stated caustically, oxytocin makes people irrational dupes;\nstated more angelically, oxytocin makes people turn the other cheek.\nMore prosocial effects of oxytocin emerged. It made people better at\ndetecting happy (versus angry, fearful, or neutral) faces or words with\npositive (versus negative) social connotations, when these were\ndisplayed briefly. Moreover, oxytocin made people more charitable.\nPeople with the version of the oxytocin receptor gene associated with\nmore sensitive parenting were rated by observers as more prosocial\n(when discussing a time of personal suffering), as well as more sensitive\nto social approval. And the neuropeptide made people more responsive\nSo oxytocin elicits prosocial behavior, and oxytocin is released when\nwe experience prosocial behavior (being trusted in a game, receiving a\nwarm touch, and so on). In other words, a warm and fuzzy positive\nfeedback loop.34\nObviously, oxytocin and vasopressin are the grooviest hormones in\nthe universe.* Pour them into the water supply, and people will be more\ncharitable, trusting, and empathic. We’d be better parents and would\nmake love, not war (mostly platonic love, though, since people in\nrelationships would give wide berths to everyone else). Best of all, we’d\nbuy all sorts of useless crap, trusting the promotional banners in stores\nonce oxytocin starts spraying out of the ventilation system.\nOkay, time to settle down a bit.\nProsociality Versus Sociality\nAre oxytocin and vasopressin about prosociality or social\ncompetence? Do these hormones make us see happy faces everywhere or\nbecome more interested in gathering accurate social information about\nfaces? The latter isn’t necessarily prosocial; after all, accurate\ninformation about someone’s emotions makes them easier to manipulate.\nThe Groovy Neuropeptide School supports the idea of ubiquitous\nprosociality.35 But the neuropeptides also foster social interest and\ncompetence. They make people look at eyes longer, increasing accuracy\nin reading emotions. Moreover, oxytocin enhances activity in the\ntemporoparietal juncture (that region involved in Theory of Mind) when\npeople do a social-recognition task. The hormone increases the accuracy\nof assessments of other people’s thoughts, with a gender twist—women\nimprove at detecting kinship relations, while men improve at detecting\ndominance relations. In addition, oxytocin increases accuracy in\nremembering faces and their emotional expressions, and people with the\n“sensitive parenting” oxytocin receptor gene variant are particularly\nadept at assessing emotions. Similarly, the hormones facilitate rodents’\nlearning of an individual’s smell, but not nonsocial odors.\nFindings like these suggest that abnormalities in these neuropeptides\nincrease the risk of disorders of impaired sociality, namely autism\nspectrum disorders (ASD) (strikingly, people with ASD show blunted\nfusiform responses to faces).37 Remarkably, ASD has been linked to\ngene variants related to oxytocin and vasopressin, to nongenetic\nmechanisms for silencing the oxytocin receptor gene, and to lower levels\nof the receptor itself. Moreover, the neuropeptides improve social skills\nin some individuals with ASD—e.g., enhancing eye contact.\nThus, sometimes oxytocin and vasopressin make us more prosocial,\nbut sometimes they make us more avid and accurate social information\ngatherers. Nonetheless, there is a happy-face bias, since accuracy is most\nenhanced for positive emotions.38\nTime for more complications.\nContingent Effects of Oxytocin and Vasopressin\nRecall testosterone’s contingent effects (e.g., making a monkey more\naggressive, but only toward individuals he already dominates). Naturally,\nthese neuropeptides’ effects are also contingent.39\nOne factor already mentioned is gender: oxytocin enhances different\naspects of social competence in women and men. Moreover, oxytocin’s\ncalming effects on the amygdala are more consistent in men than in\nwomen. Predictably, neurons that make these neuropeptides are regulated\nby both estrogen and testosterone.40\nAs a really interesting contingent effect, oxytocin enhances\ncharitability—but only in people who are already so. This mirrors\ntestosterone’s only raising aggression in aggression-prone people.\nHormones rarely act outside the context of the individual and his or her\nenvironment.41\nFinally, a fascinating study shows cultural contingencies in\noxytocin’s actions.42 During stress, Americans seek emotional support\n(e.g., telling a friend about their problem) more readily than do East\nAsians. In one study oxytocin receptor gene variants were identified in\nfeedback and approval—but only among the Americans (including\nKorean Americans). What does oxytocin do to support-seeking\nbehavior? It depends on whether you’re stressed. And on the genetic\nvariant of your oxytocin receptor. And on your culture. More to come in\nchapters 8 and 9.\nAnd the Dark Side of These Neuropeptides\nAs we saw, oxytocin (and vasopressin) decreases aggression in\nrodent females. Except for aggression in defense of one’s pups, which\nthe neuropeptide increases via effects in the central amygdala (with its\ninvolvement in instinctual fear).43\nThis readily fits with these neuropeptides enhancing maternalism,\nincluding snarling don’t-get-one-step-closer maternalism. Similarly,\nvasopressin enhances aggression in paternal prairie vole males. This\nfinding comes with a familiar additional contingency. The more\naggressive the male prairie vole, the less that aggression decreases after\nblocking of his vasopressin system—just as in the case of testosterone,\nwith increased experience, aggression is maintained by social learning\nrather than by a hormone/neuropeptide. Moreover, vasopressin increases\naggression most in male rodents who are already aggressive—yet\nanother biological effect depending on individual and social context.44\nAnd now to really upend our view of these feel-good neuropeptides.\nFor starters, back to oxytocin enhancing trust and cooperation in an\neconomic game—but not if the other player is anonymous and in a\ndifferent room. When playing against strangers, oxytocin decreases\ncooperation, enhances envy when luck is bad, and enhances gloating\nwhen it’s good.45\nFinally, beautiful studies by Carsten de Dreu of the University of\nAmsterdam showed just how unwarm and unfuzzy oxytocin can be.46 In\nthe first, male subjects formed two teams; each subject chose how much\nof his money to put into a pot shared with teammates. As usual, oxytocin\nincreased such generosity. Then participants played the Prisoner’s\nspontaneously lousy to Others who are a threat. As emphasized by De\nDreu, perhaps oxytocin evolved to enhance social competence to make\nus better at identifying who is an Us.\nIn De Dreu’s second study, Dutch student subjects took the Implicit\nAssociation Test of unconscious bias.* And oxytocin exaggerated biases\nagainst two out-groups, namely Middle Easterners and Germans.47\nThen came the study’s truly revealing second part. Subjects had to\ndecide whether it was okay to kill one person in order to save five. In the\nscenario the potential sacrificial lamb’s name was either stereotypically\nDutch (Dirk or Peter), German (Markus or Helmut), or Middle Eastern\n(Ahmed or Youssef); the five people in danger were unnamed.\nRemarkably, oxytocin made subjects less likely to sacrifice good ol’ Dirk\nor Peter, rather than Helmut or Ahmed.\nOxytocin, the luv hormone, makes us more prosocial to Us and\nworse to everyone else. That’s not generic prosociality. That’s\nethnocentrism and xenophobia. In other words, the actions of these\nneuropeptides depend dramatically on context—who you are, your\nAGGRESSION IN FEMALES\nelp!\nThis topic confuses me. Here’s why:\nThis is a domain where the ratios of two hormones can\nmatter more than their absolute levels, where the brain\nresponds the same way to (a) two units of estrogen plus\none unit of progesterone and (b) two gazillion units of\nestrogen plus one gazillion units of progesterone. This\nrequires some complex neurobiology.\nHormone levels are extremely dynamic, with\nhundredfold changes in some within hours—no male’s\ntestes ever had to navigate the endocrinology of\novulation or childbirth. Among other things, re-creating\nsuch endocrine fluctuations in lab animals is tough.\nThere’s dizzying variability across species. Some breed\nyear-round, others only in particular seasons; nursing\ninhibits ovulation in some, stimulates it in others.\nProgesterone rarely works in the brain as itself. Instead\nit’s usually converted into various “neurosteroids” with\ndiffering actions in different brain regions. And\n“estrogen” describes a soup of related hormones, none\nof which work identically.\nFinally, one must debunk the myth that females are\nalways nice and affiliative (unless, of course, they’re\naggressively protecting their babies, which is cool and\nand breeds with the greatest threat of infanticide.49\nDuring late pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone increase maternal\naggression by increasing oxytocin release in certain brain regions,\nbringing us back to oxytocin promoting maternal aggression.50\nTwo complications illustrate some endocrine principles.* Estrogen\ncontributes to maternal aggression. But estrogen can also reduce\naggression and enhance empathy and emotional recognition. It turns out\nthere are two different types of receptors for estrogen in the brain,\nmediating these opposing effects and with their levels independently\nregulated. Thus, same hormone, same levels, different outcome if the\nbrain is set up to respond differently.51\nThe other complication: As noted, progesterone, working with\nestrogen, promotes maternal aggression. However, on its own it\ndecreases aggression and anxiety. Same hormone, same levels,\ndiametrically opposite outcomes depending on the presence of a second\nhormone.52\nProgesterone decreases anxiety through a thoroughly cool route.\nWhen it enters neurons, it is converted to another steroid;* this binds to\nGABA receptors, making them more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of\nGABA, thereby calming the brain. Thus, direct cross-talk between\nhormones and neurotransmitters.\nBare-Knuckled Female Aggression\nThe traditional view is that other than maternal aggression, any\nfemale-female competition is passive, covert. As noted by the pioneering\nprimatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy of the University of California at\nDavis, before the 1970s hardly anyone even researched competition\namong females.53\nNevertheless, there is plenty of female-female aggression. This is\noften dismissed with a psychopathology argument—if, say, a female\nchimp is murderous, it’s because, well, she’s crazy. Or female aggression\nis viewed as endocrine “spillover.”54 Females synthesize small amounts\nbrains, there’s some androgen-driven aggression.\nThese views are wrong for a number of reasons.\nFemale brains don’t contain androgen receptors simply because they\ncome from a similar blueprint as male brains. Instead, androgen\nreceptors are distributed differently in the brains of females and males,\nwith higher levels in some regions in females. There has been active\nselection for androgen effects in females.55\nEven more important, female aggression makes sense—females can\nincrease their evolutionary fitness with strategic, instrumental\naggression.56 Depending on the species, females compete aggressively\nfor resources (e.g., food or nesting places), harass lower-ranking\nreproductive competitors into stress-induced infertility, or kill each\nother’s infants (as in chimps). And in the bird and (rare) primate species\nwhere males are actually paternal, females compete aggressively for such\nprinces.\nRemarkably, there are even species—primates (bonobos, lemurs,\nmarmosets, and tamarins), rock hyraxes, and rodents (the California\nmouse, Syrian golden hamsters, and naked mole rats)—where females\nare socially dominant and more aggressive (and often more muscular)\nthan males.57 The most celebrated example of a sex-reversal system is\nthe spotted hyena, shown by Laurence Frank of UC Berkeley and\ncolleagues.* Among typical social carnivores (e.g., lions), females do\nmost of the hunting, after which males show up and eat first. Among\nhyenas it’s the socially subordinate males who hunt; they are then booted\noff the kill by females so that the kids eat first. Get this: In many\nmammals erections are a sign of dominance, of a guy strutting his stuff.\nAmong hyenas it’s reversed—when a female is about to terrorize a male,\nhe gets an erection. (“Please don’t hurt me! Look, I’m just a\nnonthreatening male.”)*\nWhat explains female competitive aggression (in sex-reversal species\nor “normal” animals)? Those androgens in females are obvious suspects,\nand in some sex-reversal species females have androgen levels that equal\nor even trump those in males.58 Among hyenas, where this occurs,\nspending fetal life awash in Mom’s plentiful androgens produces a\nandrogenization.\nThis suggests that elevated female aggression in sex-reversal species\narises from the elevated androgen exposure and, by extension, that the\ndiminished aggression among females of other species comes from their\nlow androgen levels.\nBut complications emerge. For starters, there are species (e.g.,\nBrazilian guinea pigs) where females have high androgen levels but\naren’t particularly aggressive or dominant toward males. Conversely,\nthere are sex-reversal bird species without elevated androgen levels in\nfemales. Moreover, as with males, individual levels of androgens in\nfemales, whether in conventional or sex-reversal species, do not predict\nindividual levels of aggression. And most broadly, androgen levels don’t\ntend to rise around periods of female aggression.59\nThis makes sense. Female aggression is mostly related to\nreproduction and infant survival—maternal aggression, obviously, but\nalso female competition for mates, nesting places, and much-needed\nfood during pregnancy or lactation. Androgens disrupt aspects of\nreproduction and maternal behavior in females. As emphasized by Hrdy,\nfemales must balance the proaggression advantages of androgens with\ntheir antireproductive disadvantages. Ideally, then, androgens in females\nshould affect the “aggression” parts of the brain but not the\n“reproduction/maternalism” parts. Which is precisely what has evolved,\nas it turns out.*60\nPerimenstrual Aggression and Irritability\nInevitably we turn to premenstrual syndrome (PMS)*—the\nsymptoms of negative mood and irritability that come around the time of\nmenstruation (along with the bloating of water retention, cramps,\nacne . . .). There’s a lot of baggage and misconceptions about PMS\n(along with PMDD—premenstrual dysphoric disorder, where symptoms\nare severe enough to impair normal functioning; it effects 2 to 5 percent\nof women).61\nculture specific, meaning it occurs only in certain societies. Margaret\nMead started this by asserting in 1928 in Coming of Age in Samoa that\nSamoan women don’t have mood or behavioral changes when\nmenstruating. Since the Samoans were enshrined by Mead as the coolest,\nmost peaceful and sexually free primates east of bonobos, this started\ntrendy anthropological claims that women in other hip, minimal-clothing\ncultures had no PMS either.* And naturally, cultures with rampant PMS\n(e.g., American primates) were anti-Samoans, where symptoms arose\nfrom mistreatment and sexual repression of women. This view even had\nroom for a socioeconomic critique, with howlers like “PMS [is] a mode\nfor the expression of women’s anger resulting from her oppressed\nposition in American capitalist society.”*62\nAn offshoot of this view is the idea that in such repressive societies,\nit’s the most repressed women who have the worst PMS. Thus,\ndepending on the paper, women with bad PMS must be anxious,\ndepressed, neurotic, hypochondriacal, sexually repressed, toadies of\nreligious repression, or more compliant with gender stereotypes and must\nrespond to challenge by withdrawing, rather than by tackling things head\non. In other words, not a single cool Samoan among them.\nFortunately, this has mostly subsided. Numerous studies show\nnormal shifts in the brain and behavior over the course of the\nreproductive cycle, with as many behavioral correlates of ovulation as of\nmenses.*63 PMS, then, is simply a disruptively extreme version of those\nshifts. While PMS is real, symptoms vary by culture. For example,\nperimenstrual women in China report less negative affect than do\nWestern women (raising the issue of whether they experience less and/or\nreport less). Given the more than one hundred symptoms linked to PMS,\nit’s not surprising if different symptoms predominate in different\npopulations.\nAs strong evidence that perimenstrual mood and behavioral changes\nare biological, they occur in other primates.64 Both female baboons and\nfemale vervet monkeys become more aggressive and less social before\ntheir menses (without, to my knowledge, having issues with American\ncapitalism). Interestingly, the baboon study showed increased\npathologizing these shifts as “symptoms,” a “syndrome,” or “disorder.”\nThus, what is the underlying biology? A leading theory points to the\nplunging levels of progesterone as menses approaches and thus the loss\nof its anxiolytic and sedating effects. In this view, PMS arises from too\nextreme of a decline. However, there’s not much actual support for this\nidea.\nAnother theory, backed by some evidence, concerns the hormone\nbeta-endorphin, famed for being secreted during exercise and inducing a\ngauzy, euphoric “runner’s high.” In this model PMS is about abnormally\nlow levels of beta-endorphin. There are plenty more theories but very\nlittle certainty.\nNow for the question of how much PMS is associated with\naggression. In the 1960s, studies by Katharina Dalton, who coined the\nterm “premenstrual syndrome” in 1953, reported that female criminals\ncommitted their crimes disproportionately during their perimenstrual\nperiod (which may tell less about committing a crime than about getting\ncaught).65 Other studies of a boarding school showed a disproportionate\nshare of “bad marks” for behavioral offenses going to perimenstrual\nstudents. However, the prison studies didn’t distinguish between violent\nand nonviolent crimes, and the school study didn’t distinguish between\naggressive acts and infractions like tardiness. Collectively, there is little\nevidence that women tend toward aggression around their menses or that\nviolent women are more likely to have committed their acts around their\nmenses.\nNevertheless, defense pleas of PMS-related “diminished\nresponsibility” have been successful in courtrooms.66 A notable 1980\ncase concerned Sandie Craddock, who murdered a coworker and had a\nlong rap sheet with more than thirty convictions for theft, arson, and\nassault. Incongruously but fortuitously, Craddock was a meticulous\ndiarist, having years of records of not just when she was having her\nperiod but also when she was out about town on a criminal spree. Her\ncriminal acts and times of menses matched so closely that she was put on\nprobation plus progesterone treatment. And making the case stranger,\nCraddock’s doctor later reduced her progesterone dose; by her next\n121\nThese studies suggest that a small number of women do show\nperimenstrual behavior that qualifies as psychotic and should be\nmitigating in a courtroom.* Nevertheless, normal garden-variety\nperimenstrual shifts in mood and behavior are not particularly associated\nwith increased aggression.\n\nFUNCTION\nhe time before some of our most important, consequential\nbehaviors can be filled with stress. Which is too bad, since stress\ninfluences the decisions we make, rarely for the better.\nThe Basic Dichotomy of the Acute and the Chronic\nStress Response\nWe begin with a long-forgotten term from ninth-grade biology.\nRemember “homeostasis”? It means having an ideal body temperature,\nheart rate, glucose level, and so on. A “stressor” is anything that disrupts\nhomeostatic balance—say, being chased by a lion if you’re a zebra, or\nchasing after a zebra if you’re a hungry lion. The stress response is the\narray of neural and endocrine changes that occur in that zebra or lion,\ndesigned to get them through that crisis and reestablish homeostasis.*67\nCritical events in the brain mediate the start of the stress response.\n(Warning: the next two paragraphs are technical and not essential.) The\nsight of the lion activates the amygdala; amygdaloid neurons stimulate\nbrain-stem neurons, which then inhibit the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem and mobilize the sympathetic nervous system, releasing\nepinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the body.\nThe amygdala also mediates the other main branch of the stress\nresponse, activating the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the\nhypothalamus. And the PVN sends projections to the base of the\nhypothalamus, where it secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH);\nthis triggers the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone\n(ACTH), which stimulates glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenals.\nGlucocorticoids plus the sympathetic nervous system enable an\norganism to survive a physical stressor by activating the classical “fight\nor flight” response. Whether you are that zebra or that lion, you’ll need\nprojects—growth, tissue repair, and reproduction—are postponed until\nafter the crisis; after all, if a lion is chasing you, you have better things to\ndo with your energy than, say, thicken your uterine walls. Beta-\nendorphin is secreted, the immune system is stimulated, and blood\nclotting is enhanced, all useful following painful injury. Moreover,\nglucocorticoids reach the brain, rapidly enhancing aspects of cognition\nand sensory acuity.\nThis is wonderfully adaptive for the zebra or lion; try sprinting\nwithout epinephrine and glucocorticoids, and you’ll soon be dead.\nReflecting its importance, this basic stress response is ancient\nphysiology, found in mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles.\nWhat is not ancient is how stress works in smart, socially\nsophisticated, recently evolved primates. For primates the definition of a\nstressor expands beyond merely a physical challenge to homeostasis. In\naddition, it includes thinking you’re going to be thrown out of\nhomeostasis. An anticipatory stress response is adaptive if there really is\na physical challenge coming. However, if you’re constantly but\nincorrectly convinced that you’re about to be thrown out of balance,\nyou’re being an anxious, neurotic, paranoid, or hostile primate who is\npsychologically stressed. And the stress response did not evolve for\ndealing with this recent mammalian innovation.\nMobilizing energy while sprinting for your life helps save you. Do\nthe same thing chronically because of a stressful thirty-year mortgage,\nand you’re at risk for various metabolic problems, including adult-onset\ndiabetes. Likewise with blood pressure: increase it to sprint across the\nsavanna—good thing. Increase it because of chronic psychological\nstress, and you’ve got stress-induced hypertension. Chronically impair\ngrowth and tissue repair, and you’ll pay the price. Ditto for chronically\ninhibiting reproductive physiology; you’ll disrupt ovulatory cycles in\nwomen and cause plummeting erections and testosterone levels in men.\nFinally, while the acute stress response involves enhanced immunity,\nchronic stress suppresses immunity, increasing vulnerability to some\ninfectious diseases.*\nWe have a dichotomy—if you’re stressed like a normal mammal in\nfrom activating the stress response too often, too long, and for purely\npsychological reasons. Crucially, the beneficial effects of the stress\nresponse for sprinting zebras and lions play out over the course of\nseconds to minutes. But once you take stress to the time course of this\nchapter (henceforth referred to as “sustained” stress), you’ll be dealing\nwith adverse consequences. Including some unwelcome effects on the\nbehaviors that fill this book.\nA Brief Digression: Stress That We Love\nEither running from a lion or dealing with years of traffic jams is a\ndrag. Which contrasts with stress that we love.68\nWe love stress that is mild and transient and occurs in a benevolent\ncontext. The stressful menace of a roller-coaster ride is that it will make\nus queasy, not that it will decapitate us; it lasts for three minutes, not\nthree days. We love that kind of stress, clamor for it, pay to experience it.\nWhat do we call that optimal amount of stress? Being engaged,\nengrossed, and challenged. Being stimulated. Playing. The core of\npsychological stress is loss of control and predictability. But in\nbenevolent settings we happily relinquish control and predictability to be\nchallenged by the unexpected—a dip in the roller-coaster tracks, a plot\ntwist, a difficult line drive heading our way, an opponent’s unexpected\nchess move. Surprise me—this is fun.\nThis brings up a key concept, namely the inverted U. The complete\nabsence of stress is aversively boring. Moderate, transient stress is\nwonderful—various aspects of brain function are enhanced;\nglucocorticoid levels in that range enhance dopamine release; rats work\nat pressing levers in order to be infused with just the right amount of\nglucocorticoids. And as stress becomes more severe and prolonged,\nthose good effects disappear (with, of course, dramatic individual\nnow to sustained stress and the right side of the inverted U.\nSustained Stress and the Neurobiology of Fear\nFor starters, sustained stress makes people implicitly (i.e., not\nconsciously) look more at angry faces. Moreover, during stress, that\nsensory shortcut from the thalamus to the amygdala becomes more\nactive, with more excitable synapses; we know the resulting trade-off\nbetween speed and accuracy. Compounding things further,\nglucocorticoids decrease activation of the (cognitive) medial PFC during\nprocessing of emotional faces. Collectively, stress or glucocorticoid\nglucocorticoid receptors; stress and glucocorticoids increase excitability\nof amygdaloid neurons,* particularly in the basolateral amygdala (the\nBLA), with its role in learning fear. Thus, this is another contingent\nhormone action—glucocorticoids don’t cause action potentials in\namygdaloid neurons, don’t invent excitation. Instead they amplify\npreexisting excitation. Stress and glucocorticoids also increase levels of\nCRH in the BLA, and of a growth factor that builds new dendrites and\nsynapses (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF).70\nRecall from chapter 2 how during a fearful situation the amygdala\nrecruits the hippocampus into remembering contextual information about\nthe event (e.g., the amygdala remembers the thief’s knife, whereas the\nhippocampus remembers where the robbery occurred).71 Stress\nstrengthens this recruitment, making the hippocampus a temporary fear-\nladen suburb of the amygdala. Thanks to these glucocorticoid actions in\nthe amygdala,* stress makes it easier to learn a fear association and to\nconsolidate it into a long-term memory.\nThis sets us up for a positive feedback loop. As noted, with the onset\nof stress, the amygdala indirectly activates the glucocorticoid stress\nresponse. And in turn glucocorticoids increase amygdala excitability.\nStress also makes it harder to unlearn fear, to “extinguish” a\nconditioned fear association. This involves the prefrontal cortex, which\ncauses fear extinction by inhibiting the BLA (as covered in chapter 2);\nstress weakens the PFC’s hold over the amygdala.72\nRecall what fear extinction is about. You’ve learned to fearfully\nassociate a light with a shock, but today the light keeps coming on with\nno shock. Extinction is not passively forgetting that light equals shock. It\nis the BLA actively learning that light no longer equals shock. Thus\nstress facilitates learning fear associations but impairs learning fear\nextinction.\nSustained Stress, Executive Function, and\nJudgment\naccomplish this by enhancing norepinephrine signaling in the PFC so\nmuch that, instead of causing aroused focus, it induces chicken-with-its-\nhead-cut-off cognitive tumult, and by enhancing disruptive signaling\nfrom the amygdala to the PFC. Stress also desynchronizes activation in\ndifferent frontocortical regions, which impairs the ability to shift\nattention between tasks.73\nThese stress effects on frontal function also make us perseverative—\nin a rut, set in our ways, running on automatic, being habitual. We all\nknow this—what do we typically do during a stressful time when\nsomething isn’t working? The same thing again, many more times, faster\nand more intensely—it becomes unimaginable that the usual isn’t\nworking. This is precisely where the frontal cortex makes you do the\nharder but more correct thing—recognize that it’s time for a change.\nExcept for a stressed frontal cortex, or one that’s been exposed to a lot of\nglucocorticoids. In rats, monkeys, and humans, stress weakens frontal\nconnections with the hippocampus—essential for incorporating the new\ninformation that should prompt shifting to a new strategy—while\nstrengthening frontal connections with more habitual brain circuits.74\nFinally, the decreased frontal function and increased amygdaloid\nfunction during stress alter risk-taking behavior. For example, the stress\nof sleep deprivation or of public speaking, or the administration of high\nglucocorticoid levels, shifts people from protecting against losses to\nseeking bigger gains when gambling. This involves an interesting gender\ndifference—in general, major stressors make people of both genders\nmore risk taking. But moderate stressors bias men toward, and women\naway from, risk taking. In the absence of stress, men tend toward more\nrisk taking than women; thus, once again, hormones enhance a\npreexisting tendency.75\nWhether one becomes irrationally risk taking (failing to shift strategy\nin response to a declining reward rate) or risk averse (failing to respond\nto the opposite), one is incorporating new information poorly. Stated\nfunction, and disrupts frontocortical function; we’re more fearful, our\nthinking is muddled, and we assess risks poorly and act impulsively out\nof habit, rather than incorporating new data.77 This is a prescription for\nrapid, reactive aggression; stress and acute administration of\nglucocorticoids increase such aggression in both rodents and humans.\nWe have two familiar qualifications: (a) rather than creating aggression,\nstress and glucocorticoids increase sensitivity to social triggers of\naggression; (b) this occurs most readily in individuals already\npredisposed toward aggression. As we will see in the next chapter, stress\nover the course of weeks to months produces a less nuanced picture.\nThere’s an additional depressing reason why stress fosters aggression\n—because it reduces stress. Shock a rat and its glucocorticoid levels and\nblood pressure rise; with enough shocks, it’s at risk for a “stress” ulcer.\nVarious things can buffer the rat during shocks—running on a running\nwheel, eating, gnawing on wood in frustration. But a particularly\neffective buffer is for the rat to bite another rat. Stress-induced (aka\nfrustration-induced) displacement aggression is ubiquitous in various\nspecies. Among baboons, for example, nearly half of aggression is this\ntype—a high-ranking male loses a fight and chases a subadult male, who\npromptly bites a female, who then lunges at an infant. My research\nshows that within the same dominance rank, the more a baboon tends to\ndisplace aggression after losing a fight, the lower his glucocorticoid\nlevels.78\nHumans excel at stress-induced displacement aggression—consider\nhow economic downturns increase rates of spousal and child abuse. Or\nconsider a study of family violence and pro football. If the local team\nunexpectedly loses, spousal/partner violence by men increases 10\npercent soon afterward (with no increase when the team won or was\nexpected to lose). And as the stakes get higher, the pattern is\nexacerbated: a 13 percent increase after upsets when the team was in\nplayoff contention, a 20 percent increase when the upset is by a rival.79\nLittle is known concerning the neurobiology of displacement\naggression blunting the stress response. I’d guess that lashing out\neither a social stressor or a neutral situation.* Some scenarios were of\nlow emotional intensity (“In the supermarket you wait at the meat\ncounter and an elderly man pushes to the front. Would you complain?”),\nothers high intensity (“You meet the love of your life, but you are\nmarried and have children. Would you leave your family?”). Stress made\npeople give more egoistic answers about emotionally intense moral\ndecisions (but not milder ones); the more glucocorticoid levels rose, the\nmore egoistic the answers. Moreover, in the same paradigm, stress\nlessened how altruistic people claimed they’d be concerning personal\n(but not impersonal) moral decisions.81\nWe have another contingent endocrine effect: stress makes people\nmore egoistic, but only in the most emotionally intense and personal\ncircumstances.* This resembles another circumstance of poor frontal\nfunction—recall from chapter 2 how individuals with frontal cortical\ndamage make reasonable judgments about someone else’s issues, but the\nmore personal and emotionally potent the issue, the more they are\nimpaired.\nFeeling better by abusing someone innocent, or thinking more about\nyour own needs, is not compatible with feeling empathy. Does stress\ndecrease empathy? Seemingly yes, in both mice and humans. A\nremarkable 2006 paper in Science by Jeffrey Mogil of McGill University\nshowed the rudiments of mouse empathy—a mouse’s pain threshold is\nlowered when it is near another mouse in pain, but only if the other\nmouse is its cagemate.82\nThis prompted a follow-up study that I did with Mogil’s group\ninvolving the same paradigm. The presence of a strange mouse triggers a\nstress response. But when glucocorticoid secretion is temporarily\nblocked, mice show the same “pain empathy” for a strange mouse as for\na cagemate. In other words, to personify mice, glucocorticoids narrow\nwho counts as enough of an “Us” to evoke empathy. Likewise in humans\n—pain empathy was not evoked for a stranger unless glucocorticoid\nsecretion was blocked (either after administration of a short-acting drug\nor after the subject and stranger interacted socially). Recall from chapter\n2 the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex in pain empathy. I bet\nmagnificent best in some people. Work by Shelley Taylor of UCLA\nshows that “fight or flight” is the typical response to stress in males, and\nnaturally, the stress literature is predominantly studies of males by\nmales.83 Things often differ in females. Showing that she can match the\ngood old boys when it comes to snappy sound bites, Taylor framed the\nfemale stress response as being more about “tend and befriend”—caring\nfor your young and seeking social affiliation. This fits with striking sex\ndifferences in stress management styles, and tend-and-befriend most\nlikely reflects the female stress response involving a stronger component\nof oxytocin secretion.\nNaturally, things are subtler than “male = fight/flight and female =\ntend/befriend.” There are frequent counterexamples to each; stress elicits\nprosociality in more males than just pair-bonded male marmosets, and\nwe saw that females are plenty capable of aggression. Then there’s\nMahatma Gandhi and Sarah Palin.* Why are some people exceptions to\nthese gender stereotypes? That’s part of what the rest of this book is\nabout.\nStress can disrupt cognition, impulse control, emotional regulation,\ndecision making, empathy, and prosociality. One final point. Recall from\nchapter 2 how the frontal cortex making you do the harder thing when\nit’s the right thing is value free—“right thing” is purely instrumental.\nSame with stress. Its effects on decision making are “adverse” only in a\nneurobiological sense. During a stressful crisis, an EMT may become\nperseverative, making her ineffectual at saving lives. A bad thing.\nDuring a stressful crisis, a sociopathic warlord may become\nALCOHOL\no review of the biological events in the minutes to hours prior to a\nbehavior can omit alcohol. As everyone knows, alcohol lessens\ninhibitions, making people more aggressive. Wrong, and in a familiar\nway—alcohol only evokes aggression only in (a) individuals prone to\naggression (for example, mice with lower levels of serotonin signaling in\nthe frontal cortex and men with the oxytocin receptor gene variant less\nresponsive to oxytocin are preferentially made aggressive by alcohol)\nand (b) those who believe that alcohol makes you more aggressive, once\nmore showing the power of social learning to shape biology.84 Alcohol\nworks differently in everyone else—for example, a drunken stupor has\nneurotransmitters, in terms of the versatility and\nduration of their effects. And this includes affecting the\nbehaviors pertinent to this book.\nTestosterone has far less to do with aggression than most\nassume. Within the normal range, individual differences\nin testosterone levels don’t predict who will be\naggressive. Moreover, the more an organism has been\naggressive, the less testosterone is needed for future\naggression. When testosterone does play a role, it’s\nfacilitatory—testosterone does not “invent” aggression.\nIt makes us more sensitive to triggers of aggression,\nparticularly in those most prone to aggression. Also,\nrising testosterone levels foster aggression only during\nchallenges to status. Finally, crucially, the rise in\ntestosterone during a status challenge does not\nnecessarily increase aggression; it increases whatever is\nneeded to maintain status. In a world in which status is\nawarded for the best of our behaviors, testosterone\nwould be the most prosocial hormone in existence.\nOxytocin and vasopressin facilitate mother-infant bond\nformation and monogamous pair-bonding, decrease\nanxiety and stress, enhance trust and social affiliation,\nand make people more cooperative and generous. But\nthis comes with a huge caveat—these hormones increase\nprosociality only toward an Us. When dealing with\nThems, they make us more ethnocentric and\nxenophobic. Oxytocin is not a universal luv hormone.\nIt’s a parochial one.\nFemale aggression in defense of offspring is typically\nadaptive and is facilitated by estrogen, progesterone, and\ngenerating androgenic signals in “aggressive,” but not\n“maternal” or “affiliative,” parts of the female brain.\nMood and behavioral changes around the time of\nmenses are a biological reality (albeit poorly understood\non a nuts-and-bolts level); in contrast, pathologizing\nthese shifts is a social construct. Finally, except for rare,\nextreme cases, the link between PMS and aggression is\nminimal.\nSustained stress has numerous adverse effects. The\namygdala becomes overactive and more coupled to\npathways of habitual behavior; it is easier to learn fear\nand harder to unlearn it. We process emotionally salient\ninformation more rapidly and automatically, but with\nless accuracy. Frontal function—working memory,\nimpulse control, executive decision making, risk\nassessment, and task shifting—is impaired, and the\nfrontal cortex has less control over the amygdala. And\nwe become less empathic and prosocial. Reducing\nsustained stress is a win-win for us and those stuck\naround us.\n“I’d been drinking” is no excuse for aggression.\nOver the course of minutes to hours, hormonal effects\nare predominantly contingent and facilitative. Hormones\ndon’t determine, command, cause, or invent behaviors.\nInstead they make us more sensitive to the social\ntriggers of emotionally laden behaviors and exaggerate\nour preexisting tendencies in those domains.

How do synapses\n“remember”?\nWhen neuroscientists first approached the mystery of memory at the\nstart of the twentieth century, they asked that question on a more macro\nlevel—how does a brain remember? Obviously, a memory was stored in\na single neuron, and a new memory required a new neuron.\nThe discovery that adult brains don’t make new neurons trashed that\nidea. Better microscopes revealed neuronal arborization, the breathtaking\ncomplexity of branches of dendrites and axon terminals. Maybe a new\nmemory requires a neuron to grow a new axonal or dendritic branch.\nKnowledge emerged about synapses, neurotransmitter-ology was\nborn, and this idea was modified—a new memory requires the formation\nof a new synapse, a new connection between an axon terminal and a\ndendritic spine.\nThese speculations were tossed on the ash heap of history in 1949,\nbecause of the work of the Canadian neurobiologist Donald Hebb, a man\nso visionary that even now, nearly seventy years later, neuroscientists\nstill own bobblehead dolls of him. In his seminal book, The Organization\nof Behaviour, Hebb proposed what became the dominant paradigm.\nForming memories doesn’t require new synapses (let alone new branches\nor neurons); it requires the strengthening of preexisting synapses.1\nWhat does “strengthening” mean? In circuitry terms, if neuron A\nsynapses onto neuron B, it means that an action potential in neuron A\nmore readily triggers one in neuron B. They are more tightly coupled;\nthey “remember.” Translated into cellular terms, “strengthening” means\nthat the wave of excitation in a dendritic spine spreads farther, getting\ncloser to the distant axon hillock.\nExtensive research shows that experience that causes repeated firing\nacross a synapse “strengthens” it, with a key role played by the\nneurotransmitter glutamate.\nGlutamate signaling works in a fancier way that is essential to\nlearning.2 To simplify considerably, while dendritic spines typically\ncontain only one type of receptor, those responsive to glutamate contain\ntwo. The first (the “non-NMDA”) works in a conventional way—for\nevery little smidgen of glutamate binding to these receptors, a smidgen\nof sodium flows in, causing a smidgen of excitation. The second (the\n“NMDA”) works in a nonlinear, threshold manner. It is usually\nunresponsive to glutamate. It’s not until the non-NMDA has been\nstimulated over and over by a long train of glutamate release, allowing\nenough sodium to flow in, that this activates the NMDA receptor. It\nsuddenly responds to all that glutamate, opening its channels, allowing\nan explosion of excitation.\nThis is the essence of learning. The lecturer says something, and it\ngoes in one ear and out the other. The factoid is repeated; same thing. It’s\nrepeated enough times and—aha!—the lightbulb goes on and suddenly\nyou get it. At a synaptic level, the axon terminal having to repeatedly\nrelease glutamate is the lecturer droning on repetitively; the moment\nREMEMBERING\nut this has only gotten us to first base. The lightbulb going on in\nthe middle of the lecture doesn’t mean it’ll still be on in an hour, let\nalone during the final exam. How can we make that burst of excitation\npersist, so that NMDA receptors “remember,” are more easily activated\nin the future? How does the potentiated excitation become long term?\nThis is our cue to introduce the iconic concept of LTP—“long-term\npotentiation.” LTP, first demonstrated in 1966 by Terje Lømo at the\nUniversity of Oslo, is the process by which the first burst of NMDA\nreceptor activation causes a prolonged increase in excitability of the\nsynapse.* Hundreds of productive careers have been spent figuring out\nhow LTP works, and the key is that when NMDA receptors finally\nactivate and open their channels, it is calcium, rather than sodium, that\nflows in. This causes an array of changes; here are a few:\nThe calcium tidal wave causes more copies of glutamate\nreceptors to be inserted into the dendritic spine’s\nmembrane, making the neuron more responsive to\nglutamate thereafter.*\nThe calcium also alters glutamate receptors that are\nalready on the front lines of that dendritic spine; each\nwill now be more sensitive to glutamate signals.*\nThe calcium also causes the synthesis of peculiar\nneurotransmitters in the dendritic spine, which are\nreleased and travel backward across the synapse; there\nthey increase the amount of glutamate released from the\naxon terminal after future action potentials.\nIn other words, LTP arises from a combination of the presynaptic\nin organisms when they are actually learning. In general, the debate has\nbeen whether pre- or the postsynaptic changes are more crucial.\nAfter LTP came a discovery that suggests a universe in balance. This\nis LTD—long-term “depression”—experience-dependent, long-term\ndecreases in synaptic excitability (and, interestingly, the mechanisms\nunderlying LTD are not merely the opposite of LTP). LTD is not the\nfunctional opposite of LTP either—rather than being the basis of generic\nforgetting, it sharpens a signal by erasing what’s extraneous.\nA final point about LTP. There’s long term and there’s long term. As\nnoted, one mechanism underlying LTP is an alteration in glutamate\nreceptors so that they are more responsive to glutamate. That change\nmight persist for the lifetime of the copies of that receptor that were in\nthat synapse at the time of the LTPing. But that’s typically only a few\ndays, until those copies accumulate bits of oxygen-radical damage and\nare degraded and replaced with new copies (similar updating of all\nproteins constantly occurs). Somehow LTP-induced changes in the\nreceptor are transferred to the next generation of copies. How else can\noctogenarians remember kindergarten? The mechanism is elegant but\nbeyond the scope of this chapter.\nAll this is cool, but LTP and LDP are what happens in the\nhippocampus when you learn explicit facts, like someone’s phone\nnumber. But we’re interested in other types of learning—how we learn to\nbe afraid, to control our impulses, to feel empathy, or to feel nothing for\nsomeone else.\nSynapses utilizing glutamate occur throughout the nervous system,\nand LTP isn’t exclusive to the hippocampus. This was a traumatic\ndiscovery for many LTP/hippocampus researchers—after all, LTP is\nwhat occurred in Schopenhauer’s hippocampus when he read Hegel, not\nwhat the spinal cord does to make you more coordinated at twerking.*\nNonetheless, LTP occurs throughout the nervous system.*3 For\nexample, fear conditioning involves synapses LTPing in the basolateral\namygdala. LTP underlies the frontal cortex learning to control the\namygdala. It’s how dopaminergic systems learn to associate a stimulus\ngood, stimulatory stress) promotes hippocampal LTP, while prolonged\nstress disrupts it and promotes LTD—one reason why cognition tanks at\nsuch times. This is the inverted-U concept of stress writ synaptic.4\nMoreover, sustained stress and glucocorticoid exposure enhance LTP\nand suppress LTD in the amygdala, boosting fear conditioning, and\nsuppress LTP in the frontal cortex. Combining these effects—more\nexcitable synapses in the amygdala, fewer ones in the frontal cortex—\nhelps explain stress-induced impulsivity and poor emotional regulation.5\nRescued from the Trash\nThe notion of memory resting on the strengthening of preexisting\nsynapses dominates the field. But ironically, the discarded idea that\nmemory requires the formation of new synapses has been resuscitated.\nTechniques for counting all of a neuron’s synapses show that housing\nrats in a rich, stimulatory environment increases their number of\nhippocampal synapses.\nProfoundly fancy techniques let you follow one dendritic branch of a\nneuron over time as a rat learns something. Astonishingly, over minutes\nto hours a new dendritic spine emerges, followed by an axon terminal\nhovering nearby; over the next weeks, they form a functioning synapse\nthat stabilizes the new memory (and in other circumstances, dendritic\nspines retract, eliminating synapses).\nSuch “activity-dependent synaptogenesis” is coupled to LTP—when\na synapse undergoes LTP, the tsunami of calcium rushing into the spine\ncan diffuse and trigger the formation of a new spine in the adjacent\nstretch of the dendritic branch.\nNew synapses form throughout the brain—in motor-cortex neurons\nwhen you learn a motoric task, or in the visual cortex after lots of visual\nstimulation. Stimulate a rat’s whiskers a lot, and ditto in the “whisker\ncortex.”6\nMoreover, when enough new synapses form in a neuron, the length\nlevels) increases spine number in the hippocampus; sustained stress or\nglucocorticoid exposure does the opposite.7 Moreover, major depression\nor anxiety—two disorders associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels\n—can reduce hippocampal dendrite and spine number. This arises from\ndecreased levels of that key growth factor mentioned earlier this chapter,\nBDNF.\nSustained stress and glucocorticoids also cause dendritic retraction\nand synapse loss, lower levels of NCAM (a “neural cell adhesion\nmolecule” that stabilizes synapses), and less glutamate release in the\nfrontal cortex. The more of these changes, the more attentional and\ndecision-making impairments.8\nRecall from chapter 4 how acute stress strengthens connectivity\nbetween the frontal cortex and motoric areas, while weakening frontal-\nhippocampal connections; the result is decision making that is habitual,\nrather than incorporating new information. Similarly, chronic stress\nincreases spine number in frontal-motor connections and decreases it in\nfrontal-hippocampal ones.9\nContinuing the theme of the amygdala differing from the frontal\ncortex and hippocampus, sustained stress increases BDNF levels and\nexpands dendrites in the BLA, persistently increasing anxiety and fear\nconditioning.10 The same occurs in that way station by which the\namygdala talks to the rest of the brain (the BNST—bed nucleus of the\nstria terminalis). Recall that while the BLA mediates fear conditioning,\nthe central amygdala is more involved in innate phobias. Interestingly,\nstress seems not to increase the force of phobias or spine number in the\ncentral amygdala.\nThere’s wonderful context dependency to these effects. When a rat\nsecretes tons of glucocorticoids because it’s terrified, dendrites atrophy\nin the hippocampus. However, if it secretes the same amount by\nvoluntarily running on a running wheel, dendrites expand. Whether the\namygdala is also activated seems to determine whether the hippocampus\ninterprets the glucocorticoids as good or bad stress.11\nSpine number and branch length in the hippocampus and frontal\nThus, neurons can form new dendritic branches and spines,\nincreasing the size of their dendritic tree or, in other circumstances, do\nthe opposite; hormones frequently mediate these effects.\nAxonal Plasticity\nMeanwhile, there’s plasticity at the other end of the neuron, where\naxons can sprout offshoots that head off in novel directions. As a\nspectacular example, when a blind person adept at Braille reads in it,\nthere’s the same activation of the tactile cortex as in anyone else; but\namazingly, uniquely, there is also activation of the visual cortex.13 In\nother words, neurons that normally send axons to the fingertip-\nprocessing part of the cortex instead have gone miles off course, growing\nprojections to the visual cortex. One extraordinary case concerned a\ncongenitally blind woman, adept at Braille, who had a stroke in her\nvisual cortex. And as a result, she lost the ability to read Braille—the\nbumps on the page felt flattened, imprecise—while other tactile\nfunctions remained. In another study, blind subjects were trained to\nassociate letters with distinctive tones, to the point where they could hear\na sequence of tones as letters and words. When these individuals would\n“read with sound,” they’d activate the part of the visual cortex activated\nin sighted individuals when reading. Similarly, when a person who is\ndeaf and adept at American Sign Language watches someone signing,\nthere is activation of the part of their auditory cortex normally activated\nby speech.\nThe injured nervous system can “remap” in similar ways. Suppose\nthere is stroke damage to the part of your cortex that receives tactile\ninformation from your hand. The tactile receptors in your hand work fine\nbut have no neurons to talk to; thus you lose sensation in your hand. In\nthe subsequent months to years, axons from those receptors can sprout\noff in new directions, shoehorning their way into neighboring parts of the\ncortex, forming new synapses there. An imprecise sense of touch may\nslowly return to the hand (along with a less precise sense of touch in the\nvacuum, and tactile neurons in the wrist may sprout collateral axonal\nbranches and expand their territory into that neglected cortical region.\nConsider blindness due to retinal degeneration, where the projections to\nthe visual cortex are silenced. As described, fingertip tactile neurons\ninvolved in reading Braille sprout projections into the visual cortex,\nsetting up camp there. Or suppose there is a pseudoinjury: after merely\nfive days of subjects being blindfolded, auditory projections start to\nremap into the visual cortex (and retract once the blindfolds come off).14\nConsider how fingertip tactile neurons carrying information about\nBraille remap to the visual cortex in someone blind. The sensory cortex\nand visual cortex are far away from each other. How do those tactile\nneurons “know” (a) that there’s vacant property in the visual cortex; (b)\nthat hooking up with those unoccupied neurons helps turn fingertip\ninformation into “reading”; and (c) how to send axonal projections to\nthis new cortical continent? All are matters of ongoing research.\nWhat happens in a blind person when auditory projection neurons\nexpand their target range into the inactive visual cortex? More acute\nhearing—the brain can respond to deficits in one realm with\ncompensations in another.\nSo sensory projection neurons can remap. And once, say, visual\ncortex neurons are processing Braille in a blind person, those neurons\nneed to remap where they project to, triggering further downstream\nremapping. Waves of plasticity.\nRemapping occurs regularly throughout the brain in the absence of\ninjury. My favorite examples concern musicians, who have larger\nauditory cortical representation of musical sounds than do nonmusicians,\nparticularly for the sound of their own instrument, as well as for\ndetecting pitch in speech; the younger the person begins being a\nmusician, the stronger the remapping.15\nSuch remapping does not require decades of practice, as shown in\nbeautiful work by Alvaro Pascual-Leone at Harvard.16 Nonmusician\nvolunteers learned a five-finger exercise on the piano, which they\npracticed for two hours a day. Within a few days the amount of motor\ncortex devoted to the movement of that hand expanded, but the\ndays afterward. This expansion probably involved axonal sprouting and\nthe formation of new connections. Remarkably, remapping also occurred\nin volunteers who spent two hours a day imagining playing the finger\nexercise.\nAs another example of remapping, after female rats give birth, there\nis expansion of the tactile map representing the skin around the nipples.\nAs a rather different example, spend three months learning how to\njuggle, and there is expansion of the cortical map for visual processing of\nmovement.*17\nThus, experience alters the number and strength of synapses, the\nHISTORY\necall the crude, Neanderthal-ish notion that new memories require\nnew neurons, an idea discarded when Hebb was in diapers. The\nadult brain does not make new neurons. You’ve got your maximal\nnumber of neurons around birth, and it’s downhill from there, thanks to\naging and imprudence.\nYou see where we’re heading—adult brains, including aged human\nbrains, do make new neurons. The finding is truly revolutionary, its\ndiscovery epic.\nIn 1965 an untenured associate professor at MIT named Joseph\nAltman (along with a longtime collaborator, Gopal Das) found the first\nevidence for adult neurogenesis, using a then-novel technique. A newly\nmade cell contains newly made DNA. So, find a molecule unique to\nDNA. Get a test tube full of the stuff and attach a miniscule radioactive\ntag to each molecule. Inject it into an adult rat, wait awhile, and examine\nits brain. If any neurons contain that radioactive tag, it means they were\nborn during the waiting period, with the radioactive marker incorporated\ninto the new DNA.\nThis is what Altman saw in a series of studies.18 As even he notes,\nthe work was initially well received, being published in good journals,\ngenerating excitement. But within a few years something shifted, and\nAltman and his findings were rejected by leaders in the field—it couldn’t\nbe true. He failed to get tenure, spent his career at Purdue University, lost\nfunding for his adult neurogenesis work.\nSilence reigned for a decade until an assistant professor at the\nUniversity of New Mexico named Michael Kaplan extended Altman’s\nfindings with some new techniques. Again this caused mostly crushing\nrejection by senior figures in the field, including one of the most\nestablished men in neuroscience, Pasko Rakic of Yale.19\nRakic publicly rejected Kaplan’s (and tacitly Altman’s) work, saying\ncentury later, amid the excitement of the rediscovery of adult\nneurogenesis, wrote a short memoir entitled “Environmental Complexity\nStimulates Visual Cortex Neurogenesis: Death of a Dogma and a\nResearch Career”).\nThe field lay dormant for another decade until unexpected evidence\nof adult neurogenesis emerged from the lab of Fernando Nottebohm of\nRockefeller University. Nottebohm, a highly accomplished and esteemed\nneuroscientist, as good an old boy as you get, studied the neuroethology\nof birdsong. He demonstrated something remarkable, using new, more\nsensitive techniques: new neurons are made in the brains of birds that\nlearn a new territorial song each year.\nThe quality of the science and Nottebohm’s prestige silenced those\nwho doubted that neurogenesis occurred. Instead they questioned its\nrelevance—oh, that’s nice for Fernando and his birdies, but what about\nin real species, in mammals?\nBut this was soon convincingly shown in rats, using newer, fancier\ntechniques. Much of this was the work of two young scientists, Elizabeth\nGould of Princeton, and Fred “Rusty” Gage of the Salk Institute.\nSoon lots of other people were finding adult neurogenesis with these\nnew techniques, including, lo and behold, Rakic.20 A new flavor of\nskepticism emerged, led by Rakic. Yes, the adult brain makes new\nneurons, but only a few, they don’t live long, and it doesn’t happen\nwhere it really counts (i.e., the cortex); moreover, this has been shown\nonly in rodents, not in primates. Soon it was shown in monkeys.*21\nYeah, said the skeptics, but not humans, and besides, there’s no evidence\nthat these new neurons are integrated into preexisting circuits and\nactually function.\nAll of that was eventually shown—there’s considerable adult\nneurogenesis in the hippocampus (where roughly 3 percent of neurons\nare replaced each month) and lesser amounts in the cortex.22 It happens\nin humans throughout adult life. Hippocampal neurogenesis, for\nexample, is enhanced by learning, exercise, estrogen, antidepressants,\nenvironmental enrichment, and brain injury* and inhibited by various\nstressors.*23 Moreover, the new hippocampal neurons integrate into\nthought were the same are, in fact, different—dolphins and porpoises,\nbaking soda and baking powder, Zooey Deschanel and Katy Perry.\nAdult neurogenesis is the trendiest topic in neuroscience. In the five\nyears after Altman’s 1965 paper was published, it was cited (a\nrespectable) twenty-nine times in the literature; in the last five, more than\na thousand. Current work examines how exercise stimulates the process\n(probably by increasing levels of certain growth factors in the brain),\nhow new neurons know where to migrate, whether depression is caused\nby a failure of hippocampal neurogenesis, and whether the neurogenesis\nstimulated by antidepressants is required for such medications to work.24\nWhy did it take so long for adult neurogenesis to be accepted? I’ve\ninteracted with many of the principals and am struck by their differing\ntakes. At one extreme is the view that while skeptics like Rakic were\nham-handed, they provided quality control and that, counter to how path-\nof-the-hero epics go, some early work in the field was not all that solid.\nAt the other extreme is the view that Rakic et al., having failed to find\nadult neurogenesis, couldn’t accept that it existed. This psychohistorical\nview, of the old guard clinging to dogma in the face of changing winds,\nis weakened a bit by Altman’s not having been a young anarchist running\namok in the archives; in fact, he is a bit older than Rakic and other\nprincipal skeptics. All of this needs to be adjudicated by historians,\nscreenwriters, and soon, I hope, by the folks in Stockholm.\nAltman, who at the time of this writing is eighty-nine, published a\n2011 memoir chapter.25 Parts of it have a plaintive, confused tone—\neveryone was so excited at first; what happened? Maybe he spent too\nmuch time in the lab and too little marketing the discovery, he suggests.\nThere’s the ambivalence of someone who spent a long time as a scorned\nprophet who at least got to be completely vindicated. He’s philosophical\nNEUROPLASTICITY\ne’ve seen how in adults experience can alter the number of\nsynapses and dendritic branches, remap circuitry, and stimulate\nneurogenesis.26 Collectively, these effects can be big enough to actually\nchange the size of brain regions. For example, postmenopausal estrogen\ntreatment increases the size of the hippocampus (probably through a\ncombination of more dendritic branches and more neurons). Conversely,\nthe hippocampus atrophies (producing cognitive problems) in prolonged\ndepression, probably reflecting its stressfulness and the typically\nelevated glucocorticoid levels of the disease. Memory problems and loss\nof hippocampal volume also occur in individuals with severe chronic\npain syndromes, or with Cushing’s syndrome (an array of disorders\nwhere a tumor causes extremely elevated glucocorticoid levels).\nMoreover, post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with increased\nvolume (and, as we know, hyperreactivity) of the amygdala. In all of\nthese instances it is unclear how much the stress/glucocorticoid effects\nare due to changes in neuron number or to changes in amounts of\ndendritic processes.*\nOne cool example of the size of a brain region changing with\nexperience concerns the back part of the hippocampus, which plays a\nrole in memory of spatial maps. Cab drivers use spatial maps for a living,\nand one renowned study showed enlargement of that part of the\nhippocampus in London taxi drivers. Moreover, a follow-up study\nimaged the hippocampus in people before and after the grueling\nmultiyear process of working and studying for the London cabbie license\ntest (called the toughest test in the world by the New York Times). The\nhippocampus enlarged over the course of the process—in those who\npassed the test.27\nThus, experience, health, and hormone fluctuations can change the\nsize of parts of the brain in a matter of months. Experience can also\nWith chronic stress the nucleus accumbens is depleted of dopamine,\nbiasing rats toward social subordination and biasing humans toward\ndepression. As we saw in the last chapter, if a rodent wins a fight on his\nhome territory, there are long-lasting increases in levels of testosterone\nreceptors in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmentum, enhancing\ntestosterone’s pleasurable effects. There’s even a parasite called\nToxoplasma gondii that can infect the brain; over the course of weeks to\nmonths, it makes rats less fearful of the smell of cats and makes humans\nless fearful and more impulsive in subtle ways. Basically, most anything\nyou can measure in the nervous system can change in response to a\nhe discovery of adult neurogenesis is revolutionary, and the general\ntopic of neuroplasticity, in all its guises, is immensely important—\nas is often the case when something the experts said couldn’t be turns out\nto be.29 The subject is also fascinating because of the nature of the\nrevisionism—neuroplasticity radiates optimism. Books on the topic are\nentitled The Brain That Changes Itself, Train Your Mind, Change Your\nBrain, and Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life, hinting at\nthe “new neurology” (i.e., no more need for neurology once we can fully\nharness neuroplasticity). There’s can-do Horatio Alger spirit every which\nway you look.\nAmid that, some cautionary points:\nOne recalls caveats aired in other chapters—the ability\nof the brain to change in response to experience is value\nfree. Axonal remapping in blind or deaf individuals is\ngreat, exciting, and moving. It’s cool that your\nhippocampus expands if you drive a London cab. Ditto\nabout the size and specialization of the auditory cortex\nin the triangle player in the orchestra. But at the other\nend, it’s disastrous that trauma enlarges the amygdala\nand atrophies the hippocampus, crippling those with\nPTSD. Similarly, expanding the amount of motor cortex\ndevoted to finger dexterity is great in neurosurgeons but\nprobably not a societal plus in safe crackers.\nThe extent of neuroplasticity is most definitely finite.\nOtherwise, grievously injured brains and severed spinal\ncords would ultimately heal. Moreover, the limits of\nneuroplasticity are quotidian. Malcolm Gladwell has\nexplored how vastly skilled individuals have put in vast\namounts of practice—ten thousand hours is his magic\nManipulating neuroplasticity for recovery of function does have\nenormous, exciting potential in neurology. But this domain is far from\nthe concerns of this book. Despite neuroplasticity’s potential, it’s\nunlikely that we’ll ever be able to, say, spritz neuronal growth factors up\npeople’s noses to make them more open-minded or empathic, or to target\nneuroplasticity with gene therapy to blunt some jerk’s tendency to\ndisplace aggression.\nSo what’s the subject good for in the realm of this book? I think the\nbenefits are mostly psychological. This recalls a point from chapter 2, in\nthe discussion of the neuroimaging studies demonstrating loss of volume\nin the hippocampus of people with PTSD (certainly an example of the\nadverse effects of neuroplasticity). I sniped that it was ridiculous that\nmany legislators needed pictures of the brain to believe that there was\nsomething desperately, organically wrong with veterans with PTSD.\nSimilarly, neuroplasticity makes the functional malleability of the\nbrain tangible, makes it “scientifically demonstrated” that brains change.\nThat people change. In the time span considered in this chapter, people\nthroughout the Arab world went from being voiceless to toppling tyrants;\nRosa Parks went from victim to catalyst, Sadat and Begin from enemies\nto architects of peace, Mandela from prisoner to statesman. And you’d\nbetter bet that changes along the lines of those presented in this chapter\noccurred in the brains of anyone transformed by these transformations.

    "start_page": 152,
    "end_page": 172,
    "content": "Adolescence; or, Dude,\nWhere’s My Frontal\nCortex?\nhis chapter is the first of two focusing on development. We’ve\nestablished our rhythm: a behavior has just occurred; what events\nin the prior seconds, minutes, hours, and so on helped bring it about? The\nnext chapter extends this into the developmental domain—what\nhappened during that individual’s childhood and fetal life that\ncontributed to the behavior?\nThe present chapter breaks this rhythm in focusing on adolescence.\nDoes the biology introduced in the preceding chapters work differently\nin an adolescent than in an adult, producing different behaviors? Yes.\nOne fact dominates this chapter. Chapter 5 did in the dogma that\nadult brains are set in stone. Another dogma was that brains are pretty\nmuch wired up early in childhood—after all, by age two, brains are\nalready about 85 percent of adult volume. But the developmental\ntrajectory is much slower than that. This chapter’s key fact is that the\nfinal brain region to fully mature (in terms of synapse number,\nmyelination, and metabolism) is the frontal cortex, not going fully online\nuntil the midtwenties.1\nThis has two screamingly important implications. First, no part of the\nadult brain is more shaped by adolescence than the frontal cortex.\nSecond, nothing about adolescence can be understood outside the context\nof delayed frontocortical maturation. If by adolescence limbic,\nworld changing. Think about this—adolescence and early adulthood are\nthe times when someone is most likely to kill, be killed, leave home\nforever, invent an art form, help overthrow a dictator, ethnically cleanse\na village, devote themselves to the needy, become addicted, marry\noutside their group, transform physics, have hideous fashion taste, break\ntheir neck recreationally, commit their life to God, mug an old lady, or be\nconvinced that all of history has converged to make this moment the\nmost consequential, the most fraught with peril and promise, the most\ndemanding that they get involved and make a difference. In other words,\ns adolescence real? Is there something qualitatively different\ndistinguishing it from before and after, rather than being part of a\nsmooth progression from childhood to adulthood? Maybe “adolescence”\nis just a cultural construct—in the West, as better nutrition and health\nresulted in earlier puberty onset, and the educational and economic\nforces of modernity pushed for childbearing at later ages, a\ndevelopmental gap emerged between the two. Voilà! The invention of\nadolescence.*2\nAs we’ll see, neurobiology suggests that adolescence is for real, that\nthe adolescent brain is not merely a half-cooked adult brain or a child’s\nbrain left unrefrigerated for too long. Moreover, most traditional cultures\ndo recognize adolescence as distinct, i.e., it brings some but not all of the\nrights and responsibilities of adulthood. Nonetheless, what the West\ninvented is the longest period of adolescence.*\nWhat does seem a construct of individualistic cultures is adolescence\nas a period of intergenerational conflict; youth of collectivist cultures\nseem less prone toward eye rolling at the dorkiness of adults, starting\nwith parents. Moreover, even within individualistic cultures adolescence\nCORTICAL MATURATION\nhe delayed maturation of the frontal cortex suggests an obvious\nscenario, namely that early in adolescence the frontal cortex has\nfewer neurons, dendritic branches, and synapses than in adulthood, and\nthat levels increase into the midtwenties. Instead, levels decrease.\nThis occurs because of a truly clever thing evolved by mammalian\nbrains. Remarkably, the fetal brain generates far more neurons than are\nfound in the adult. Why? During late fetal development, there is a\ndramatic competition in much of the brain, with winning neurons being\nthe ones that migrate to the correct location and maximize synaptic\nconnections to other neurons. And neurons that don’t make the grade?\nThey undergo “programmed cell death”—genes are activated that cause\nthem to shrivel and die, their materials then recycled. Neuronal\noverproduction followed by competitive pruning (which has been termed\n“neural Darwinism”) allowed the evolution of more optimized neural\ncircuitry, a case of less being more.\nThe same occurs in the adolescent frontal cortex. By the start of\nadolescence, there’s a greater volume of gray matter (an indirect measure\nof the total number of neurons and dendritic branches) and more\nsynapses than in adults; over the next decade, gray-matter thickness\ndeclines as less optimal dendritic processes and connections are pruned\naway.*3 Within the frontal cortex, the evolutionarily oldest subregions\nmature first; the spanking-new (cognitive) dorsolateral PFC doesn’t even\nstart losing gray-matter volume until late adolescence. The importance of\nthis developmental pattern was shown in a landmark study in which\nchildren were neuroimaged and IQ tested repeatedly into adulthood. The\nlonger the period of packing on gray-matter cortical thickness in early\nadolescence before the pruning started, the higher the adult IQ.\nThus, frontal cortical maturation during adolescence is about a more\nefficient brain, not more brain. This is shown in easily misinterpreted\nlevel of executive control equal to that of adults. In those situations\nadolescents show more frontal activation than adults—equivalent\nregulation takes less effort in a well-pruned adult frontal cortex.\nThat the adolescent frontal cortex is not yet lean and mean is\ndemonstrable in additional ways. For example, adolescents are not at\nadult levels of competence at detecting irony and, when trying to do so,\nactivate the dmPFC more than do adults. In contrast, adults show more\nactivation in the fusiform face region. In other words, detecting irony\nisn’t much of a frontal task for an adult; one look at the face is enough.5\nWhat about white matter in the frontal cortex (that indirect measure\nof myelination of axons)? Here things differ from the overproduce-then-\nprune approach to gray matter; instead, axons are myelinated throughout\nadolescence. As discussed in appendix 1, this allows neurons to\ncommunicate in a more rapid, coordinated manner—as adolescence\nprogresses, activity in different parts of the frontal cortex becomes more\ncorrelated as the region operates as more of a functional unit.6\nThis is important. When learning neuroscience, it’s easy to focus on\nindividual brain regions as functionally distinct (and this tendency\nworsens if you then spend a career studying just one of them). As a\nmeasure of this, there are two high-quality biomedical journals out there,\none called Cortex, the other Hippocampus, each publishing papers about\nits favorite brain region. At neuroscience meetings attended by tens of\nthousands, there’ll be social functions for all the people studying the\nsame obscure brain region, a place where they can gossip and bond and\ncourt. But in reality the brain is about circuits, about the patterns of\nfunctional connectivity among regions. The growing myelination of the\nadolescent brain shows the importance of increased connectivity.\nInterestingly, other parts of the adolescent brain seem to help out the\nunderdeveloped frontal cortex, taking on some roles that it’s not yet\nready for. For example, in adolescents but not adults, the ventral striatum\nhelps regulate emotions; we will return to this.7\nSomething else keeps that tyro frontal cortex off-kilter, namely\nestrogen and progesterone in females and testosterone in males. As\ndiscussed in chapter 4, these hormones alter brain structure and function,\nMoreover, puberty is not just about the onslaught of gonadal\nhormones. It’s about how they come online.9 The defining feature of\novarian endocrine function is the cyclicity of hormone release—“It’s that\ntime of the month.” In adolescent females puberty does not arrive full\nflower, so to speak, with one’s first period. Instead, for the first few years\nonly about half of cycles actually involve ovulation and surges of\nestrogen and progesterone. Thus, not only are young adolescents\nexperiencing these first ovulatory cycles, but there are also higher-order\nfluctuations in whether the ovulatory fluctuation occurs. Meanwhile,\nwhile adolescent males don’t have equivalent hormonal gyrations, it\ncan’t help that their frontal cortex keeps getting hypoxic from the priapic\nblood flow to the crotch.\nThus, as adolescence dawns, frontal cortical efficiency is diluted with\nextraneous synapses failing to make the grade, sluggish communication\nthanks to undermyelination, and a jumble of uncoordinated subregions\nworking at cross-purposes; moreover, while the striatum is trying to help,\na pinch hitter for the frontal cortex gets you only so far. Finally, the\nfrontal cortex is being pickled in that ebb and flow of gonadal hormones.\nNo wonder they act adolescent.\nFrontal Cortical Changes in Cognition in\nAdolescence\nTo appreciate what frontal cortical maturation has to do with our best\nand worst behaviors, it’s helpful to first see how such maturation plays\nout in cognitive realms.\nDuring adolescence there’s steady improvement in working memory,\nflexible rule use, executive organization, and frontal inhibitory regulation\n(e.g., task shifting). In general, these improvements are accompanied by\nincreasing activity in frontal regions during tasks, with the extent of the\nincrease predicting accuracy.10\nAdolescents also improve at mentalization tasks (understanding\nsomeone else’s perspective). By this I don’t mean emotional perspective\nFrontal Cortical Changes in Emotional Regulation\nOlder teenagers experience emotions more intensely than do children\nor adults, something obvious to anyone who ever spent time as a\nteenager. For example, they are more reactive to faces expressing strong\nemotions.*11 In adults, looking at an “affective facial display” activates\nthe amygdala, followed by activation of the emotion-regulating vmPFC\nas they habituate to the emotional content. In adolescence, though, the\nvmPFC response is less; thus the amygdaloid response keeps growing.\nChapter 2 introduced “reappraisal,” in which responses to strong\nemotional stimuli are regulated by thinking about them differently.12 Get\na bad grade on an exam, and there’s an emotional pull toward “I’m\nstupid”; reappraisal might lead you instead to focus on your not having\nstudied or having had a cold, to decide that the outcome was situational,\nrather than a function of your unchangeable constitution.\nReappraisal strategies get better during adolescence, with logical\nneurobiological underpinnings. Recall how in early adolescence, the\nventral striatum, trying to be helpful, takes on some frontal tasks (fairly\nineffectively, as it’s working above its pay grade). At that age reappraisal\nengages the ventral striatum; more activation predicts less amygdaloid\nactivation and better emotional regulation. As the adolescent matures,\nthe prefrontal cortex takes over the task, and emotions get steadier.*13\nBringing the striatum into the picture brings up dopamine and\nn the foothills of the Sierras are California Caverns, a cave system\nthat leads, after an initial narrow, twisting 30-foot descent down a\nhole, to an abrupt 180-foot drop (now navigable by rappelling). The Park\nService has found skeletons at the bottom dating back centuries,\nexplorers who took one step too far in the gloom. And the skeletons are\nalways those of adolescents.\nAs shown experimentally, during risky decision making, adolescents\nactivate the prefrontal cortex less than do adults; the less activity, the\npoorer the risk assessment. This poor assessment takes a particular form,\nas shown by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore of University College London.14\nHave subjects estimate the likelihood of some event occurring (winning\nthe lottery, dying in a plane crash); then tell them the actual likelihood.\nSuch feedback can constitute good news (i.e., something good is actually\nmore likely than the person estimated, or something bad is less likely).\nConversely, the feedback can constitute bad news. Ask subjects to\nestimate the likelihood of the same events again. Adults incorporate the\nfeedback into the new estimates. Adolescents update their estimates as\nadults do for good news, but feedback about bad news barely makes a\ndent. (Researcher: “How likely are you to have a car accident if you’re\ndriving while drunk?” Adolescent: “One chance in a gazillion.”\nResearcher: “Actually, the risk is about 50 percent; what do you think\nyour own chances are now?” Adolescent: “Hey, we’re talking about me;\none chance in a gazillion.”) We’ve just explained why adolescents have\ntwo to four times the rate of pathological gambling as do adults.15\nSo adolescents take more risks and stink at risk assessment. But it’s\nnot just that teenagers are more willing to take risks. After all,\nadolescents and adults don’t equally desire to do something risky and the\nadults simply don’t do it because of their frontal cortical maturity. There\nis an age difference in the sensations sought—adolescents are tempted to\nbungee jump; adults are tempted to cheat on their low-salt diet.\nnovelty declining thereafter.17 And it’s not just a human phenomenon.\nAcross the rodent life span, it’s adolescents who are most willing to eat a\nnew food. Adolescent novelty seeking is particularly strong in other\nprimates. Among many social mammals, adolescents of one sex leave\ntheir natal group, emigrating into another population, a classic means to\navoid inbreeding. Among impalas there are groups of related females\nand offspring with one breeding male; the other males knock around\ndisconsolately in “bachelor herds,” each scheming to usurp the breeding\nmale. When a young male hits puberty, he is driven from the group by\nthe breeding male (and to avoid some Oedipus nonsense, this is unlikely\nto be his father, who reigned many breeding males ago).\nBut not among primates. Take baboons. Suppose two troops\nencounter each other at some natural boundary—say, a stream. The\nmales threaten each other for a while, eventually get bored, and resume\nwhatever they were doing. Except there’s an adolescent, standing at the\nstream’s edge, riveted. New baboons, a whole bunch of ’em! He runs\nfive steps toward them, runs back four, nervous, agitated. He gingerly\ncrosses and sits on the other bank, scampering back should any new\nbaboon glance at him.\nSo begins the slow process of transferring, spending more time each\nday with the new troop until he breaks the umbilical cord and spends the\nnight. He wasn’t pushed out. Instead, if he has to spend one more day\nwith the same monotonous baboons he’s known his whole life, he’ll\nscream. Among adolescent chimps it’s females who can’t get off the\nfarm fast enough. We primates aren’t driven out at adolescence. Instead\nwe desperately crave novelty.*\nThus, adolescence is about risk taking and novelty seeking. Where\ndoes the dopamine reward system fit in?\nRecall from chapter 2 how the ventral tegmentum is the source of the\nmesolimbic dopamine projection to the nucleus accumbens, and of the\nmesocortical dopamine projection to the frontal cortex. During\nadolescence, dopamine projection density and signaling steadily increase\nin both pathways (although novelty seeking itself peaks at\nare higher, the lows lower.\nVisit bit.ly/2o3TBI8 for a larger version of this graph.\nIt’s unclear how much dopamine is released in anticipation of\nreward. Some studies show more anticipatory activation of reward\npathways in adolescents than in adults, while others show the opposite,\nwith the least dopaminergic responsiveness in adolescents who are most\nrisk taking.19\nAge differences in absolute levels of dopamine are less interesting\nthan differences in patterns of release. In a great study, children,\nadolescents, and adults in brain scanners did some task where correct\nresponses produced monetary rewards of varying sizes (see figure\nabove).20 During this, prefrontal activation in both children and\nadolescents was diffuse and unfocused. However, activation in the\nnucleus accumbens in adolescents was distinctive. In children, a correct\nanswer produced roughly the same increase in activity regardless of size\nof reward. In adults, small, medium, and large rewards caused small,\nmedium, and large increases in accumbens activity. And adolescents?\nAfter a medium reward things looked the same as in kids and adults. A\nlarge reward produced a humongous increase, much bigger than in\nThis suggests that in adolescents strong rewards produce exaggerated\ndopaminergic signaling, and nice sensible rewards for prudent actions\nfeel lousy. The immature frontal cortex hasn’t a prayer to counteract a\ndopamine system like this. But there is something puzzling.\nAmid their crazy, unrestrained dopamine neurons, adolescents have\nreasoning skills that, in many domains of perceiving risk, match those of\nadults. Yet despite that, logic and reasoning are often jettisoned, and\nadolescents act adolescent. Work by Laurence Steinberg of Temple\nSOCIAL EXCLUSION\ndolescent vulnerability to peer pressure from friends, especially\npeers they want to accept them as friends, is storied. It can also be\ndemonstrated experimentally. In one Steinberg study adolescents and\nadults took risks at the same rate in a video driving game. Adding two\npeers to egg them on had no effect on adults but tripled risk taking in\nadolescents. Moreover, in neuroimaging studies, peers egging subjects\non (by intercom) lessens vmPFC activity and enhances ventral striatal\nactivity in adolescents but not adults.21\nWhy do adolescents’ peers have such social power? For starters,\nadolescents are more social and more complexly social than children or\nadults. For example, a 2013 study showed that teens average more than\nfour hundred Facebook friends, far more than do adults.22 Moreover,\nteen sociality is particularly about affect, and responsiveness to\nemotional signaling—recall the greater limbic and lesser frontal cortical\nresponse to emotional faces in adolescents. And teens don’t rack up four\nhundred Facebook friends for data for their sociology doctorates. Instead\nthere is the frantic need to belong.\nThis produces teen vulnerability to peer pressure and emotional\ncontagion. Moreover, such pressure is typically “deviance training,”\nincreasing the odds of violence, substance abuse, crime, unsafe sex, and\npoor health habits (few teen gangs pressure kids to join them in tooth\nflossing followed by random acts of kindness). For example, in college\ndorms the excessive drinker is more likely to influence the teetotaling\nroommate than the reverse. The incidence of eating disorders in\nadolescents spreads among peers with a pattern resembling viral\ncontagion. The same occurs with depression among female adolescents,\nreflecting their tendency to “co-ruminate” on problems, reinforcing one\nanother’s negative affect.\nNeuroimaging studies show the dramatic sensitivity of adolescents to\nthink about yourself?” is neurally answered with “Whatever everyone\nelse thinks about me.”23\nThe frantic adolescent need to belong is shown beautifully in studies\nof the neurobiology of social exclusion. Naomi Eisenberger of UCLA\ndeveloped the fiendishly clever “Cyberball” paradigm to make people\nfeel snubbed.24 The subject lies in a brain scanner, believing she is\nplaying an online game with two other people (naturally, they don’t exist\n—it’s a computer program). Each player occupies a spot on the screen,\nforming a triangle. The players toss a virtual ball among themselves; the\nsubject is picking whom to throw to and believes the other two are doing\nthe same. The ball is tossed for a while; then, unbeknownst to the\nsubject, the experiment begins—the other two players stop throwing the\nball to her. She’s being excluded by those creeps. In adults there is\nactivation of the periaqueductal gray, anterior cingulate, amygdala, and\ninsular cortex. Perfect—these regions are central to pain perception,\nanger, and disgust.* And then, after a delay, the ventrolateral PFC\nactivates; the more activation, the more the cingulate and insula are\nsilenced and the less subjects report being upset afterward. What’s this\ndelayed vlPFC activation about? “Why am I getting upset? This is just a\nstupid game of catch.” The frontal cortex comes to the rescue with\nperspective, rationalization, and emotion regulation.\nNow do the study with teenagers. Some show the adult neuroimaging\nprofiles; these are ones who rate themselves as least sensitive to rejection\nand who spend the most time with friends. But for most teenagers, when\nsocial exclusion occurs, the vlPFC barely activates; the other changes are\nbigger than in adults, and the subjects report feeling lousier—adolescents\nlack sufficient frontal forcefulness to effectively hand-wave about why it\ndoesn’t matter. Rejection hurts adolescents more, producing that stronger\nneed to fit in.25\nOne neuroimaging study examined a neural building block of\nconformity.26 Watch a hand moving, and neurons in premotor regions\nthat contribute to moving your own hand become a bit active—your\nbrain is on the edge of imitating the movement. In the study, ten-year-\nolds watched film clips of hand movements or facial expressions; those\n(Given the age of the subjects, the authors framed their findings as\npotentially predictive of later teen behavior.)*\nThis atomistic level of explaining conformity might predict\nsomething about which teens are likely to join in a riot. But it doesn’t tell\nmuch about who chooses not to invite someone to a party because the\ncool kids think she’s a loser.\nAnother study showed neurobiological correlates of more abstract\npeer conformity. Recall how the adolescent ventral striatum helps the\nfrontal cortex reappraise social exclusion. In this study, young\nadolescents most resistant to peer influence had the strongest such\nventral striatal responses. And where might a stronger ventral striatum\nREASONING\ny adolescence, people are typically pretty good at perspective\ntaking, seeing the world as someone else would. That’s usually\nwhen you’ll first hear the likes of “Well, I still disagree, but I can see\nhow he feels that way, given his experience.”\nNonetheless, adolescents are not yet adults. Unlike adults, they are\nstill better at first- than third-person perspective taking (“How would you\nfeel in her situation?” versus “How does she feel in her situation?”).27\nAdolescent moral judgments, while growing in sophistication, are still\nnot at adult levels. Adolescents have left behind children’s egalitarian\ntendency to split resources evenly. Instead, adolescents mostly make\nmeritocratic decisions (with a smattering of utilitarian and libertarian\nviewpoints thrown in); meritocratic thinking is more sophisticated than\negalitarian, since the latter is solely about outcomes, while the former\nincorporates thinking about causes. Nonetheless, adolescents’\nmeritocratic thinking is less complex than adults’—for example,\nadolescents are as adept as adults at understanding how individual\ncircumstances impact behavior, but not at understanding systemic\ncircumstances.\nAs adolescents mature, they increasingly distinguish between\nintentional and accidental harm, viewing the former as worse.28 When\ncontemplating the latter, there is now less activation of three brain\nregions related to pain processing, namely the amygdala, the insula, and\nthe premotor areas (the last reflecting the tendency to cringe when\nhearing about pain being inflicted). Meanwhile, there is increasing\ndlPFC and vmPFC activation when contemplating intentional harm. In\nother words, it is a frontal task to appreciate the painfulness of\nsomeone’s being harmed intentionally.\nAs adolescents mature, they also increasingly distinguish between\nharm to people and harm to objects (with the former viewed as worse);\nthe damage becomes that, accidental or otherwise, the damn thing needs\nto be fixed—even if there is less crying over spilled milk, there is no less\ncleaning required.*\nWhat about one of the greatest things about adolescents, with respect\nto this book’s concerns—their frenzied, agitated, incandescent ability to\nfeel someone else’s pain, to feel everyone’s pain, to try to make\neverything right? A later chapter distinguishes between sympathy and\nempathy—between feeling for someone in pain and feeling as that\nsomeone. Adolescents are specialists at the latter, where the intensity of\nfeeling as the other can border on being the other.\nThis intensity is no surprise, being at the intersection of many facets\nof adolescence. There are the abundant emotions and limbic gyrations.\nThe highs are higher, the lows lower, empathic pain scalds, and the glow\nof doing the right thing makes it seem plausible that we are here for a\npurpose. Another contributing factor is the openness to novelty. An open\nmind is a prerequisite for an open heart, and the adolescent hunger for\nnew experiences makes possible walking miles in lots of other people’s\nshoes. And there is the egoism of adolescence. During my late\nadolescence I hung out with Quakers, and they’d occasionally use the\naphorism “All God has is thee.” This is the God of limited means, not\njust needing the help of humans to right a wrong, but needing you, you\nonly, to do so. The appeal to egoism is tailor-made for adolescents.\nThrow in inexhaustible adolescent energy plus a feeling of omnipotence,\nand it seems possible to make the world whole, so why not?\nIn chapter 13 we consider how neither the most burning emotional\ncapacity for empathy nor the most highfalutin moral reasoning makes\nsomeone likely to actually do the brave, difficult thing. This raises a\nsubtle limitation of adolescent empathy.\nAs will be seen, one instance where empathic responses don’t\nnecessarily lead to acts is when we think enough to rationalize (“It’s\noverblown as a problem” or “Someone else will fix it”). But feeling too\nmuch has problems as well. Feeling someone else’s pain is painful, and\npeople who do so most strongly, with the most pronounced arousal and\nIn contrast, the more individuals can regulate their adverse empathic\nemotions, the more likely they are to act prosocially. Related to that, if a\ndistressing, empathy-evoking circumstance increases your heart rate,\nyou’re less likely to act prosocially than if it decreases it. Thus, one\npredictor of who actually acts is the ability to gain some detachment, to\nride, rather than be submerged, by the wave of empathy.\nWhere do adolescents fit in, with their hearts on their sleeves, fully\ncharged limbic systems, and frontal cortices straining to catch up? It’s\nobvious. A tendency toward empathic hyperarousal that can disrupt\nacting effectively.29\nThis adolescent empathy frenzy can seem a bit much for adults. But\nwhen I see my best students in that state, I have the same thought—it\nused to be so much easier to be like that. My adult frontal cortex may\nenable whatever detached good I do. The trouble, of course, is how that\nbviously, the adolescent years are not just about organizing bake\nsales to fight global warming. Late adolescence and early\nadulthood are when violence peaks, whether premeditated or impulsive\nmurder, Victorian fisticuffs or handguns, solitary or organized (in or out\nof a uniform), focused on a stranger or on an intimate partner. And then\nrates plummet. As has been said, the greatest crime-fighting tool is a\nthirtieth birthday.\nOn a certain level the biology underlying the teenaged mugger is\nsimilar to that of the teen who joins the Ecology Club and donates his\nallowance to help save the mountain gorillas. It’s the usual—heightened\nemotional intensity, craving for peer approval, novelty seeking, and, oh,\nthat frontal cortex. But that’s where similarities end.\nWhat underlies the adolescent peak in violence? Neuroimaging\nshows nothing particularly distinct about it versus adult violence.30\nAdolescent and adult psychopaths both have less sensitivity of the PFC\nand the dopamine system to negative feedback, less pain sensitivity, and\nless amygdaloid/frontal cortical coupling during tasks of moral reasoning\nor empathy.\nMoreover, the adolescent peak of violence isn’t caused by the surge\nin testosterone; harking back to chapter 4, testosterone no more causes\nviolence in adolescents than it does in adult males. Moreover,\ntestosterone levels peak during early adolescence, but violence peaks\nlater.\nThe next chapter considers some of the roots of adolescent violence.\nFor now, the important point is that an average adolescent doesn’t have\nthe self-regulation or judgment of an average adult. This can prompt us\nto view teenage offenders as having less responsibility than adults for\ncriminal acts. An alternative view is that even amid poorer judgment and\nself-regulation, there is still enough to merit equivalent sentencing. The\nformer view has held in two landmark Supreme Court decisions.\nIn the first, 2005’s Roper v. Simmons, the Court ruled 5–4 that\nparole for juvenile offenders, on similar grounds.31\nThe Court’s reasoning was straight out of this chapter. Writing for the\nmajority in Roper v. Simmons, Justice Anthony Kennedy said:\nFirst, [as everyone knows, a] lack of maturity and an\nunderdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more\noften than in adults and are more understandable among the\nyoung. These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-\nconsidered actions and decisions.32\nI fully agree with these rulings. But, to show my hand early, I think\nthis is just window dressing. As will be covered in the screed that\nFRONTAL CORTEX JUST ACT ITS AGE?\ns promised, this chapter’s dominant fact has been the delayed\nmaturation of the frontal cortex. Why should the delay occur? Is it\nbecause the frontal cortex is the brain’s most complicated construction\nproject?\nProbably not. The frontal cortex uses the same neurotransmitter\nsystems as the rest of the brain and uses the same basic neurons.\nNeuronal density and complexity of interconnections are similar to the\nrest of the (fancy) cortex. It isn’t markedly harder to build frontal cortex\nthan any other cortical region.\nThus, it is not likely that if the brain “could” grow a frontal cortex as\nfast as the rest of the cortex, it “would.” Instead I think there was\nevolutionary selection for delayed frontal cortex maturation.\nIf the frontal cortex matured as fast as the rest of the brain, there’d be\nnone of the adolescent turbulence, none of the antsy, itchy exploration\nand creativity, none of the long line of pimply adolescent geniuses who\ndropped out of school and worked away in their garages to invent fire,\ncave painting, and the wheel.\nMaybe. But this just-so story must accommodate behavior evolving\nto pass on copies of the genes of individuals, not for the good of the\nspecies (stay tuned for chapter 10). And for every individual who scored\nbig time reproductively thanks to adolescent inventiveness, there’ve been\nfar more who instead broke their necks from adolescent imprudence. I\ndon’t think delayed frontal cortical maturation evolved so that\nadolescents could act over the top.\nInstead, I think it is delayed so that the brain gets it right. Well, duh;\nthe brain needs to “get it right” with all its parts. But in a distinctive way\nin the frontal cortex. The point of the previous chapter was the brain’s\nplasticity—new synapses form, new neurons are born, circuits rewire,\nhappiness better than do IQ or SAT scores.33 It’s all about social\nmemory, emotional perspective taking, impulse control, empathy, ability\nto work with others, self-regulation. There is a parallel in other primates,\nwith their big, slowly maturing frontal cortices. For example, what\nmakes for a “successful” male baboon in his dominance hierarchy?\nAttaining high rank is about muscle, sharp canines, well-timed\naggression. But once high status is achieved, maintaining it is all about\nsocial smarts—knowing which coalitions to form, how to intimidate a\nrival, having sufficient impulse control to ignore most provocations and\nto keep displacement aggression to a reasonable level. Similarly, as noted\nin chapter 2, among male rhesus monkeys a large prefrontal cortex goes\nhand in hand with social dominance.\nAdult life is filled with consequential forks in the road where the\nright thing is definitely harder. Navigating these successfully is the\nportfolio of the frontal cortex, and developing the ability to do this right\nin each context requires profound shaping by experience.\nThis may be the answer. As we will see in chapter 8, the brain is\nheavily influenced by genes. But from birth through young adulthood,\nthe part of the human brain that most defines us is less a product of the\ngenes with which you started life than of what life has thrown at you.\nBecause it is the last to mature, by definition the frontal cortex is the\nbrain region least constrained by genes and most sculpted by experience.\nThis must be so, to be the supremely complex social species that we are."

When seeking the roots of behavior, long before neurons\nor hormones come to mind, we typically look first at childhood.\n\nhildhood is obviously about increasing complexity in every realm\nof behavior, thought, and emotion. Crucially, such increasing\ncomplexity typically emerges in stereotypical, universal sequences of\nstages. Most child behavioral development research is implicitly stage\noriented, concerning: (a) the sequence with which stages emerge; (b)\nhow experience influences the speed and surety with which that\nsequential tape of maturation unreels; and (c) how this helps create the\nDEVELOPMENT\nhe stages of human brain development make sense. A few weeks\nafter conception, a wave of neurons are born and migrate to their\ncorrection locations. Around twenty weeks, there is a burst of synapse\nformation—neurons start talking to one another. And then axons start\nbeing wrapped in myelin, the glial cell insulation (forming “white\nmatter”) that speeds up action.\nNeuron formation, migration, and synaptogenesis are mostly prenatal\nin humans.1 In contrast, there is little myelin at birth, particularly in\nevolutionarily newer brain regions; as we’ve seen, myelination proceeds\nfor a quarter century. The stages of myelination and consequent\nfunctional development are stereotypical. For example, the cortical\nregion central to language comprehension myelinates a few months\nearlier than that for language production—kids understand language\nbefore producing it.\nMyelination is most consequential when enwrapping the longest\naxons, in neurons that communicate the greatest distances. Thus\nmyelination particularly facilitates brain regions talking to one another.\nNo brain region is an island, and the formation of circuits connecting far-\nflung brain regions is crucial—how else can the frontal cortex use its few\nmyelinated neurons to talk to neurons in the brain’s subbasement to\nmake you toilet trained?2\nAs we saw, mammalian fetuses overproduce neurons and synapses;\nineffective or unessential synapses and neurons are pruned, producing\nleaner, meaner, more efficient circuitry. To reiterate a theme from the last\nhat stages of child development help explain the good/bad/in-\nbetween adult behavior that got the ball rolling in chapter 1?\nThe mother of all developmental stage theories was supplied in 1923,\npioneered by Jean Piaget’s clever, elegant experiments revealing four\nstages of cognitive development:4\nSensorimotor stage (birth to ~24 months). Thought\nconcerns only what the child can directly sense and\nexplore. During this stage, typically at around 8 months,\nchildren develop “object permanence,” understanding\nthat even if they can’t see an object, it still exists—the\ninfant can generate a mental image of something no\nlonger there.*\nPreoperational stage (~2 to 7 years). The child can\nmaintain ideas about how the world works without\nexplicit examples in front of him. Thoughts are\nincreasingly symbolic; imaginary play abounds.\nHowever, reasoning is intuitive—no logic, no cause and\neffect. This is when kids can’t yet demonstrate\n“conservation of volume.” Identical beakers A and B are\nfilled with equal amounts of water. Pour the contents of\nbeaker B into beaker C, which is taller and thinner. Ask\nthe child, “Which has more water, A or C?” Kids in the\npreoperational stage use incorrect folk intuition—the\nwater line in C is higher than that in A; it must contain\nmore water.\nConcrete operational stage (7 to 12 years). Kids think\nlogically, no longer falling for that different-shaped-\nbeakers nonsense. However, generalizing logic from\n176\nfeather flock together’ means that similar birds form\nflocks”).\nFormal operational stage (adolescence onward).\nApproaching adult levels of abstraction, reasoning, and\nmetacognition.\n\n177\nKid playing hide-and-seek while in the “If I can’t see you (or even if I can’t see\nyou as easily as usual), then you can’t see me” stage.\n\n—“There is a ‘me,’ separate from everyone else.” A lack of ego\nboundaries is shown when a toddler isn’t all that solid on where he ends\nand Mommy starts—she’s cut her finger, and he claims his finger hurts.5\nNext comes the stage of realizing that other individuals have\ndifferent information than you do. Nine-month-olds look where someone\npoints (as can other apes and dogs), knowing the pointer has information\nthat they don’t. This is fueled by motivation: Where is that toy? Where’s\nshe looking? Older kids understand more broadly that other people have\ndifferent thoughts, beliefs, and knowledge than they, the landmark of\nachieving Theory of Mind (ToM).6\nHere’s what not having ToM looks like. A two-year-old and an adult\nsee a cookie placed in box A. The adult leaves, and the researcher\nswitches the cookie to box B. Ask the child, “When that person comes\nback, where will he look for the cookie?” Box B—the child knows it’s\nthere and thus everyone knows. Around age three or four the child can\nreason, “They’ll think it’s in A, even though I know it’s in B.” Shazam:\nToM.\nMastering such “false belief” tests is a major developmental\nlandmark. ToM then progresses to fancier insightfulness—e.g., grasping\nirony, perspective taking, or secondary ToM (understanding person A’s\nToM about person B).7\nVarious cortical regions mediate ToM: parts of the medial PFC\n(surprise!) and some new players, including the precuneus, the superior\ntemporal sulcus, and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). This is shown\nwith neuroimaging; by ToM deficits if these regions are damaged\n(autistic individuals, who have limited ToM, have decreased gray matter\nand activity in the superior temporal sulcus); and by the fact that if you\ntemporarily inactivate the TPJ, people don’t consider someone’s\nintentions when judging them morally.8\nThus there are stages of gaze following, followed by primary ToM,\nthen secondary ToM, then perspective taking, with the speed of\ntransitions influenced by experience (e.g., kids with older siblings\nachieve ToM earlier than average).9\nOne example to be discussed in chapter 12 concerns preverbal\ninfants, who sure don’t grasp transitivity (if A > B, and B > C, then A >\nC). Show a violation of transitivity in interactions between shapes on a\nscreen (shape A should knock over shape C, but the opposite occurs),\nand the kid is unbothered, doesn’t look for long. But personify the shapes\nwith eyes and a mouth, and now heart rate increases, the kid looks longer\n—“Whoa, character C is supposed to move out of character A’s way,\nnot the reverse.” Humans understand logical operations between\nindividuals earlier than between objects.10\nSocial and motivational state can shift cognitive stage as well.\nRudiments of ToM are more demonstrable in chimps who are interacting\nwith another chimp (versus a human) and if there is something\nmotivating—food—involved.*11\nEmotion and affect can alter cognitive stage in remarkably local\nways. I saw a wonderful example of this when my daughter displayed\nboth ToM and failure of ToM in the same breath. She had changed\npreschools and was visiting her old class. She told everyone about life in\nher new school: “Then, after lunch, we play on the swings. There are\nswings at my new school. And then, after that, we go inside and Carolee\nreads us a story. Then, after that . . .” ToM: “play on the swings”—wait,\nthey don’t know that my school has swings; I need to tell them. Failure\nof ToM: “Carolee reads us a story.” Carolee, the teacher at her new\nschool. The same logic should apply—tell them who Carolee is. But\nbecause Carolee was the most wonderful teacher alive, ToM failed.\nAfterward I asked her, “Hey, why didn’t you tell everyone that Carolee is\nyour teacher?” “Oh, everyone knows Carolee.” How could everyone\nnot?\nFeeling Someone Else’s Pain\nToM leads to a next step—people can have different feelings than\nme, including pained ones.12 This realization is not sufficient for\nempathy. After all, sociopaths, who pathologically lack empathy, use\npacifier (and the empathy is rudimentary in that the toddler can’t imagine\nsomeone being comforted by different things than she is).\nYes, very rudimentary. Maybe the toddler feels profound empathy. Or\nmaybe she’s just distressed by the crying and is self-interestedly trying to\nquiet the adult. The childhood capacity for empathy progresses from\nfeeling someone’s pain because you are them, to feeling for the other\nperson, to feeling as them.\nThe neurobiology of kid empathy makes sense. As introduced in\nchapter 2, in adults the anterior cingulate cortex activates when they see\nsomeone hurt. Ditto for the amygdala and insula, especially in instances\nof intentional harm—there is anger and disgust. PFC regions including\nthe (emotional) vmPFC are on board. Observing physical pain (e.g., a\nfinger being poked with a needle) produces a concrete, vicarious pattern:\nthere is activation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region central to\nyour own pain perception, in parts of the sensory cortex receiving\nsensation from your own fingers, and in motor neurons that command\nyour own fingers to move.* You clench your fingers.\nWork by Jean Decety of the University of Chicago shows that when\nseven-year-olds watch someone in pain, activation is greatest in the more\nconcrete regions—the PAG and the sensory and motor cortices—with\nPAG activity coupled to the minimal vmPFC activation there is. In older\nkids the vmPFC is coupled to increasingly activated limbic structures.13\nAnd by adolescence the stronger vmPFC activation is coupled to ToM\nregions. What’s happening? Empathy is shifting from the concrete world\nof “Her finger must hurt, I’m suddenly conscious of my own finger” to\nToM-ish focusing on the pokee’s emotions and experience.\nYoung kids’ empathy doesn’t distinguish between intentional and\nunintentional harm or between harm to a person and to an object. Those\ndistinctions emerge with age, around the time when the PAG part of\nempathic responses lessens and there is more engagement of the vmPFC\nand ToM regions; moreover, intentional harm now activates the\namygdala and insula—anger and disgust at the perpetrator.* This is also\nwhen kids first distinguish between self- and other-inflicted pain.\nMore sophistication—by around age seven, kids are expressing their\nThere are also hints of a sense of justice. Preschoolers tend to be\negalitarians (e.g., it’s better that the friend gets a cookie when she does).\nBut before we get carried away with the generosity of youth, there is\nalready in-group bias; if the other child is a stranger, there is less\negalitarianism.14\nThere is also a growing tendency of kids to respond to an injustice,\nwhen someone has been treated unfairly.15 But once again, before getting\ncarried away with things, it comes with a bias. By ages four through six,\nkids in cultures from around the world respond negatively when they are\nthe ones being shortchanged. It isn’t until ages eight through ten that kids\nrespond negatively to someone else being treated unfairly. Moreover,\nthere is considerable cross-cultural variability as to whether that later\nstage even emerges. The sense of justice in young kids is a very self-\ninterested one.\nSoon after kids start responding negatively to someone else being\ntreated unjustly, they begin attempting to rectify previous inequalities\n(“He should get more now because he got less before”).16 By\npreadolescence, egalitarianism gives way to acceptance of inequality\nbecause of merit or effort or for a greater good (“She should play more\nthan him; she’s better/worked harder/is more important to the team”).\nSome kids even manage self-sacrifice for the greater good (“She should\nplay more than me; she’s better”).* By adolescence, boys tend to accept\ninequality more than girls do, on utilitarian grounds. And both sexes are\nacquiescing to inequality as social convention—“Nothing can be done;\nthat’s the way it is.”\nMoral Development\nWith ToM, perspective taking, nuanced empathy, and a sense of\njustice in place, a child can start wrestling with telling right from wrong.\nPiaget emphasized how much kids’ play is about working out rules\nof appropriate behavior (rules that can differ from those of adults)* and\nhow this involves stages of increasing complexity. This inspired a\nformulating his monumental stages of moral development.17\nKids would be presented with moral conundrums. For example: The\nonly dose of the only drug that will save a poor woman from dying is\nprohibitively expensive. Should she steal it? Why?\nKohlberg concluded that moral judgment is a cognitive process, built\naround increasingly complex reasoning as kids mature. He proposed his\nfamed three stages of moral development, each with two subparts.\nYou’ve been told not to eat the tempting cookie in front of you.\nShould you eat it? Here are the painfully simplified stages of reasoning\nthat go into the decision:\nLevel 1: Should I Eat the Cookie? Preconventional\nReasoning\nStage 1. It depends. How likely am I to get punished? Being\npunished is unpleasant. Aggression typically peaks around ages two\nthrough four, after which kids are reined in by adults’ punishment (“Go\nsit in the corner”) and peers (i.e., being ostracized).\nStage 2. It depends. If I refrain, will I get rewarded? Being rewarded\nis nice.\nBoth stages are ego-oriented—obedience and self-interest (what’s in\nit for me?). Kohlberg found that children are typically at this level up to\naround ages eight through ten.\nConcern arises when aggression, particularly if callous and\nremorseless, doesn’t wane around these ages—this predicts an increased\nrisk of adult sociopathy (aka antisocial personality).* Crucially, the\nbehavior of future sociopaths seems impervious to negative feedback. As\nnoted, high pain thresholds in sociopaths help explain their lack of\nempathy—it’s hard to feel someone else’s pain when you can’t feel your\nown. It also helps explain the imperviousness to negative feedback—\nwhy change your behavior if punishment doesn’t register?\nIt is also around this stage that kids first reconcile after conflicts and\nLevel 2: Should I Eat the Cookie? Conventional\nReasoning\nStage 3. It depends. Who will be deprived if I do? Do I like them?\nWhat would other people do? What will people think of me for eating\nthe cookie? It’s nice to think of others; it’s good to be well regarded.\nStage 4. It depends. What’s the law? Are laws sacrosanct? What if\neveryone broke this law? It’s nice to have order. This is the judge who,\nconsidering predatory but legal lending practices by a bank, thinks, “I\nfeel sorry for these victims . . . but I’m here to decide whether the bank\nbroke a law . . . and it didn’t.”\nConventional moral reasoning is relational (about your interactions\nwith others and their consequences); most adolescents and adults are at\nthis level.\nLevel 3: Should I Eat the Cookie?\nPostconventional Reasoning\nStage 5: It depends. What circumstances placed the cookie there?\nWho decided that I shouldn’t take it? Would I save a life by taking the\ncookie? It’s nice when clear rules are applied flexibly. Now the judge\nwould think: “Yes, the bank’s actions were legal, but ultimately laws\nexist to protect the weak from the mighty, so signed contract or\notherwise, that bank must be stopped.”\nStage 6: It depends. Is my moral stance regarding this more vital than\nsome law, a stance for which I’d pay the ultimate price if need be? It’s\nnice to know there are things for which I’d repeatedly sing, “We Will\nNot Be Moved.”\nThis level is egoistic in that rules and their application come from\nwithin and reflect conscience, where a transgression exacts the ultimate\ncost—having to live with yourself afterward. It recognizes that being\ngood and being law-abiding aren’t synonymous. As Woody Guthrie\nMan, those sheep who just follow, etc. To quote Emerson, as is often\ndone when considering the postconventional stage, “Every heroic act\nmeasures itself by its contempt of some external good.” Stage 6\nreasoning can inspire. But it can also be insufferable, premised on “being\ngood” and “being law abiding” as opposites. “To live outside the law,\nyou must be honest,” wrote Bob Dylan.\nKohlbergians found hardly anyone consistently at stage 5 or stage 6.\n—\nKohlberg basically invented the scientific study of moral development in\nchildren. His stage model is so canonical that people in the business dis\nsomeone by suggesting they’re stuck in the primordial soup of a\nprimitive Kohlberg stage. As we’ll see in chapter 12, there is even\nevidence that conservatives and liberals reason at different Kohlberg\nstages.\nNaturally, Kohlberg’s work has problems.\nThe usual: Don’t take any stage model too seriously—there are\nexceptions, maturational transitions are not clean cut, and someone’s\nstage can be context dependent.\nThe problem of tunnel vision and wrong emphases: Kohlberg initially studied\nthe usual unrepresentative humans, namely Americans, and as we will\nsee in later chapters, moral judgments differ cross-culturally. Moreover,\nsubjects were male, something challenged in the 1980s by Carol Gilligan\nof NYU. The two agreed on the general sequence of stages. However,\nGilligan and others showed that in making moral judgments, girls and\nwomen generally value care over justice, in contrast to boys and men. As\na result, females tilt toward conventional thinking and its emphasis on\nrelationships, while males tilt toward postconventional abstractions.18\nThe cognitive emphasis: Are moral judgments more the outcome of\nreasoning or of intuition and emotion? Kohlbergians favor the former.\nBut as will be seen in chapter 13, plenty of organisms with limited\ncognitive skills, including young kids and nonhuman primates, display\nrudimentary senses of fairness and justice. Such findings anchor “social\nintuitionist” views of moral decision making, associated with\nreasoning; and (b) conversely, moral reasoning is often flagrantly\nillogical. Stay tuned.\nThe lack of predictability: Does any of this actually predict who does the\nharder thing when it’s the right thing to do? Are gold medalists at\nKohlbergian reasoning the ones willing to pay the price for whistle-\nblowing, subduing the shooter, sheltering refugees? Heck, forget the\nheroics; are they even more likely to be honest in dinky psych\nexperiments? In other words, does moral reasoning predict moral action?\nRarely; as we will see in chapter 13, moral heroism rarely arises from\nsuper-duper frontal cortical willpower. Instead, it happens when the right\nthing isn’t the harder thing.\nMarshmallows\nThe frontal cortex and its increasing connectivity with the rest of the\nbrain anchors the neurobiology of kids’ growing sophistication, most\nimportantly in their capacity to regulate emotions and behavior. The\nmost iconic demonstration of this revolves around an unlikely object—\nthe marshmallow.20\nIn the 1960s Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel developed the\n“marshmallow test” to study gratification postponement. A child is\npresented with a marshmallow. The experimenter says, “I’m going out of\nthe room for a while. You can eat the marshmallow after I leave. But if\nyou wait and don’t eat it until I get back, I’ll give you another\nmarshmallow,” and leaves. And the child, observed through a two-way\nmirror, begins the lonely challenge of holding out for fifteen minutes\nuntil the researcher returns.\nStudying hundreds of three- to six-year-olds, Mischel saw enormous\nvariability—a few ate the marshmallow before the experimenter left the\nroom. About a third lasted the fifteen minutes. The rest were scattered in\nbetween, averaging a delay of eleven minutes. Kids’ strategies for\nresisting the marshmallow’s siren call differed, as can be seen on\ncontemporary versions of the test on YouTube. Some kids cover their\neyes, hide the marshmallow, sing to distract themselves. Others grimace,\ninstead of marshmallows). Trusting the system mattered—if\nexperimenters had previously betrayed on promises, kids wouldn’t wait\nas long. Prompting kids to think about how crunchy and yummy pretzels\nare (what Mischel calls “hot ideation”) nuked self-discipline; prompts to\nthink about a “cold ideation” (e.g., the shape of pretzels) or an alternative\nhot ideation (e.g., ice cream) bolstered resistance.\nAs expected, older kids hold out longer, using more effective\nstrategies. Younger kids describe strategies like “I kept thinking about\nhow good that second marshmallow would taste.” The problem, of\ncourse, is that this strategy is about two synapses away from thinking\nabout the marshmallow in front of you. In contrast, older kids use\nstrategies of distraction—thinking about toys, pets, their birthday. This\nprogresses to reappraisal strategies (“This isn’t about marshmallows.\nThis is about the kind of person I am”). To Mischel, maturation of\nwillpower is more about distraction and reappraisal strategies than about\nstoicism.\nSo kids improve at delayed gratification. Mischel’s next step made\nhis studies iconic—he tracked the kids afterward, seeing if marshmallow\nwait time predicted anything about their adulthoods.\nDid it ever. Five-year-old champs at marshmallow patience averaged\nhigher SAT scores in high school (compared with those who couldn’t\nwait), with more social success and resilience and less aggressive* and\noppositional behavior. Forty years postmarshmallow, they excelled at\nfrontal function, had more PFC activation during a frontal task, and had\nlower BMIs.21 A gazillion-dollar brain scanner doesn’t hold more\npredictive power than one marshmallow. Every anxious middle-class\ne’ve now gotten a sense of various domains of behavioral\ndevelopment. Time to frame things with this book’s central\nquestion. Our adult has carried out that wonderful or crummy or\nambiguous behavior. What childhood events contributed to that\noccurring?\nA first challenge is to truly incorporate biology into our thinking. A\nchild suffers malnutrition and, as an adult, has poor cognitive skills.\nThat’s easy to frame biologically—malnutrition impairs brain\ndevelopment. Alternatively, a child is raised by cold, inexpressive\nparents and, as an adult, feels unlovable. It’s harder to link those two\nbiologically, to resist thinking that somehow this is a less biological\nphenomenon than the malnutrition/cognition link. There may be less\nknown about the biological changes explaining the link between the cold\nparents and the adult with poor self-esteem than about the\nmalnutrition/cognition one. It may be less convenient to articulate the\nformer biologically than the latter. It may be harder to apply a proximal\nbiological therapy for the former than for the latter (e.g., an imaginary\nneural growth factor drug that improves self-esteem versus cognition).\nBut biology mediates both links. A cloud may be less tangible than a\nbrick, but it’s constructed with the same rules about how atoms interact.\nHow does biology link childhood with the behaviors of adulthood?\nChapter 5’s neural plasticity writ large and early. The developing brain\nepitomizes neural plasticity, and every hiccup of experience has an\neffect, albeit usually a miniscule one, on that brain.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF MOTHERS\nothing like a section heading stating the obvious. Everybody needs\na mother. Even rodents; separate rat pups from Mom a few hours\ndaily and, as adults, they have elevated glucocorticoid levels and poor\ncognitive skills, are anxious, and, if male, are more aggressive.22\nMothers are crucial. Except that well into the twentieth century, most\nexperts didn’t think so. The West developed child-rearing techniques\nwhere, when compared with traditional cultures, children had less\nphysical contact with their mothers, slept alone at earlier ages, and had\nlonger latencies to be picked up when crying. Around 1900 the leading\nexpert Luther Holt of Columbia University warned against the “vicious\npractice” of picking up a crying child or handling her too often. This was\nthe world of children of the wealthy, raised by nannies and presented to\ntheir parents before bedtime to be briefly seen but not heard.\nThis period brought one of history’s strangest one-night stands,\nnamely when the Freudians and the behaviorists hooked up to explain\nwhy infants become attached to their mothers. To behaviorists,\nobviously, it’s because mothers reinforce them, providing calories when\nthey’re hungry. For Freudians, also obviously, infants lack the “ego\ndevelopment” to form a relationship with anything/anyone other than\nMom’s breasts. When combined with children-should-be-seen-but-not-\nheard-ism, this suggested that once you’ve addressed a child’s need for\nnutrition, proper temperature, plus other odds and ends, they’re set to go.\nAffection, warmth, physical contact? Superfluous.\nSuch thinking produced at least one disaster. When a child was\nhospitalized for a stretch, dogma was that the mother was unnecessary—\nshe just added emotional tumult, and everything essential was supplied\nby the staff. Typically, mothers could visit their children once a week for\na few minutes. And when kids were hospitalized for extended periods,\nthey wasted away with “hospitalism,” dying in droves from nonspecific\nincubators (adapted from poultry farming); the safest hospitals were poor\nones that relied on the primitive act of humans actually touching and\ninteracting with infants.\nIn the 1950s the British psychiatrist John Bowlby challenged the\nview of infants as simple organisms with few emotional needs; his\n“attachment theory” birthed our modern view of the mother-infant\nbond.*24 In his trilogy Attachment and Loss, Bowlby summarized the\nno-brainer answers we’d give today to the question “What do children\nneed from their mothers?”: love, warmth, affection, responsiveness,\nstimulation, consistency, reliability. What is produced in their absence?\nAnxious, depressed, and/or poorly attached adults.*\nBowlby inspired one of the most iconic experiments in psychology’s\nhistory, by Harry Harlow of the University of Wisconsin; it destroyed\nFreudian and behaviorist dogma about mother-infant bonding.25 Harlow\nwould raise an infant rhesus monkey without a mother but with two\n“surrogates” instead. Both were made of a chicken-wire tube\napproximating a torso, with a monkey-ish plastic head on top. One\nsurrogate had a bottle of milk coming from its “torso.” The other had\nterry cloth wrapped around the torso. In other words, one gave calories,\nthe other a poignant approximation of a mother monkey’s fur. Freud and\nB. F. Skinner would have wrestled over access to chicken-wire mom. But\ninfant monkeys chose the terry-cloth mom.* “Man cannot live by milk\nalone. Love is an emotion that does not need to be bottle- or spoon-fed,”\nwrote Harlow.\nEvidence for the most basic need provided by a mother comes from a\ncontroversial quarter. Starting in the 1990s, crime rates plummeted\nacross the United States. Why? For liberals the answer was the thriving\neconomy. For conservatives it was the larger budgets for policing,\nexpanded prisons, and three-strikes sentencing laws. Meanwhile, a\npartial explanation was provided by legal scholar John Donohue of\nStanford and economist Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago—it\nwas the legalization of abortions. The authors’ state-by-state analysis of\nthe liberalization of abortion laws and the demographics of the crime\ndrop showed that when abortions become readily available in an area,\nif she could, would have chosen\nthat you not be. What’s the most\nbasic thing provided by a mother?\nKnowing that she is happy that you\nexist.*26\nHarlow also helped demonstrate\na cornerstone of this book, namely\nwhat mothers (and later peers)\nprovide as children grow. To do so,\nhe performed some of the most\ninflammatory research in\npsychology’s history. This involved\nraising infant monkeys in isolation,\nabsent mother or peers; they spent\nthe first months, even years, of their lives without contact with another\nliving being, before being placed in a social group.*\nPredictably, they’d be wrecks. Some would sit alone, clutching\nthemselves, rocking “autistically.” Others would be markedly\ninappropriate in their hierarchical or sexual behaviors.\nThere was something interesting. It wasn’t that these ex-isolates did\nbehaviors wrong—they didn’t aggressively display like an ostrich, make\nthe sexually solicitive gestures of a gecko. Behaviors were normal but\noccurred at the wrong time and place—say, giving subordination\ngestures to pipsqueaks half their size, threatening alphas they should\ncower before. Mothers and peers don’t teach the motoric features of\nfixed action patterns; those are hardwired. They teach when, where, and\nto whom—the appropriate context for those behaviors. They give the\nfirst lessons about when touching someone’s arm or pulling a trigger can\nbe among the best or worst of our behaviors.\nI saw a striking example of this among the baboons that I study in\nKenya, when both a high-ranking and a low-ranking female gave birth to\ndaughters the same week. The former’s kid hit every developmental\nlandmark earlier than the other, the playing field already unlevel. When\n191\nover to say hello. And as she got near, her low-ranking mother grabbed\nher by the tail and pulled her back.\nThis was her first lesson about her place in that world. “You see her?\nShe’s much higher ranking than you, so you don’t just go and hang with\nher. If she’s around, you sit still and avoid eye contact and hope she\ndoesn’t take whatever you’re eating.” Amazingly, in twenty years those\ntwo infants would be old ladies, sitting in the savanna, still displaying the\nrank asymmetries they learned that morning.\n\narlow provided another important lesson, thanks to another study\npainful to contemplate. Infant monkeys were raised with chicken-\nwire surrogates with air jets in the middle of their torsos. When an infant\nclung, she’d receive an aversive blast of air. What would a behaviorist\npredict that the monkey would do when faced with such punishment?\nFlee. But, as in the world of abused children and battered partners,\ninfants held harder.\nWhy do we often become attached to a source of negative\nreinforcement, seek solace when distressed from the cause of that\ndistress? Why do we ever love the wrong person, get abused, and return\nfor more?\nPsychological insights abound. Because of poor self-esteem,\nbelieving you’ll never do better. Or a codependent conviction that it’s\nyour calling to change the person. Maybe you identify with your\noppressor, or have decided it’s your fault and the abuser is justified, so\nthey seem less irrational and terrifying. These are valid and can have\nhuge explanatory and therapeutic power. But work by Regina Sullivan of\nNYU demonstrates bits of this phenomenon miles from the human\npsyche.\nSullivan would condition rat pups to associate a neutral odor with a\nshock.27 If a pup that had been conditioned at ten days of age or older\n(“older pups”) was exposed to that odor, logical things happened—\namygdala activation, glucocorticoid secretion, and avoidance of the odor.\nBut do the same to a younger pup and none of that would occur;\nremarkably, the pup would be attracted to the odor.\nWhy? There is an interesting wrinkle related to stress in newborns.\nRodent fetuses are perfectly capable of secreting glucocorticoids. But\nwithin hours of birth, the adrenal glands atrophy dramatically, becoming\nbarely able to secrete glucocorticoids. This “stress hyporesponsive\nperiod” (SHRP) wanes over the coming weeks.28\nWhat is the SHRP about? Glucocorticoids have so many adverse\nhours their adrenals expand and regain the ability to secrete plenty of\nglucocorticoids.\nDuring the SHRP infants seem to use a further rule: “If Mom is\naround (and I thus don’t secrete glucocorticoids), I should get attached to\nany strong stimulus. It couldn’t be bad for me; Mom wouldn’t allow\nthat.” As evidence, inject glucocorticoids into the amygdalae of young\npups during the conditioning, and the amygdalae would activate and the\npups would develop an aversion to the odor. Conversely, block\nglucocorticoid secretion in older pups during conditioning, and they’d\nbecome attracted to the odor. Or condition them with their mother\npresent, and they wouldn’t secrete glucocorticoids and would develop an\nattraction. In other words, in young rats even aversive things are\nreinforcing in Mom’s presence, even if Mom is the source of the aversive\nstimuli. As Sullivan and colleagues wrote, “attachment [by such an\ninfant] to the caretaker has evolved to ensure that the infant forms a bond\nto that caregiver regardless of the quality of care received.” Any kind of\nmother in a storm.\nIf this applies to humans, it helps explain why individuals abused as\nkids are as adults prone toward relationships in which they are abused by\ntheir partner.29 But what about the flip side? Why is it that about 33\npercent of adults who were abused as children become abusers\nthemselves?\nAgain, useful psychological insights abound, built around\nidentification with the abuser and rationalizing away the terror: “I love\nmy kids, but I smack them around when they need it. My father did that\nto me, so he could have loved me too.” But once again something\nPLACE\nanticipated that, with mothers now covered, we’d next examine the\nadult consequences of, say, paternal deprivation, or childhood poverty, or\nexposure to violence or natural disasters. And there’d be the same\nquestion—what specific biological changes did each cause in children\nthat increased the odds of specific adult behaviors?\nBut this plan didn’t work—the similarities of effects of these varied\ntraumas are greater than the differences. Sure, there are specific links\n(e.g., childhood exposure to domestic violence makes adult antisocial\nviolence more likely than does childhood exposure to hurricanes). But\nthey all converge sufficiently that I will group them together, as is done\nin the field, as examples of “childhood adversity.”\nBasically, childhood adversity increases the odds of an adult having\n(a) depression, anxiety, and/or substance abuse; (b) impaired cognitive\ncapabilities, particularly related to frontocortical function; (c) impaired\nimpulse control and emotion regulation; (d) antisocial behavior,\nincluding violence; and (e) relationships that replicate the adversities of\nchildhood (e.g., staying with an abusive partner).31 And despite that,\nsome individuals endure miserable childhoods just fine. More on this to\ncome.\nll these forms of adversity are obviously stressful and cause\nabnormalities in stress physiology. Across numerous species,\nmajor early-life stressors produce both kids and adults with elevated\nlevels of glucocorticoids (along with CRH and ACTH, the hypothalamic\nand pituitary hormones that regulate glucocorticoid release) and\nhyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system.32 Basal glucocorticoid\nlevels are elevated—the stress response is always somewhat activated—\nand there is delayed recovery back to baseline after a stressor. Michael\nMeaney of McGill University has shown how early-life stress\npermanently blunts the ability of the brain to rein in glucocorticoid\nsecretion.\nAs covered in chapter 4, marinating the brain in excess\nglucocorticoids, particularly during development, adversely effects\ncognition, impulse control, empathy, and so on.33 There is impaired\nhippocampal-dependent learning in adulthood. For example, abused\nchildren who develop PTSD have decreased volume of the hippocampus\nin adulthood. Stanford psychiatrist Victor Carrion has shown decreased\nhippocampal growth within months of the abuse. As a likely cause,\nglucocorticoids decrease hippocampal production of the growth factor\nBDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor).\nSo childhood adversity impairs learning and memory. Crucially, it\nalso impairs maturation and function of the frontal cortex; again,\nglucocorticoids, via inhibiting BDNF, are likely culprits.\nThe connection between childhood adversity and frontocortical\nmaturation pertains to childhood poverty. Work by Martha Farah of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Tom Boyce of UCSF, and others\ndemonstrates something outrageous: By age five, the lower a child’s\nsocioeconomic status, on the average, the (a) higher the basal\nglucocorticoid levels and/or the more reactive the glucocorticoid stress\nresponse, (b) the thinner the frontal cortex and the lower its metabolism,\nand (c) the poorer the frontal function concerning working memory,\nof axonal fibers connecting the two hemispheres and integrating their\nfunction. This is so wrong—foolishly pick a poor family to be born into,\nand by kindergarten, the odds of your succeeding at life’s marshmallow\ntests are already stacked against you.34\nConsiderable research focuses on how poverty “gets under the skin.”\nSome mechanisms are human specific—if you’re poor, you’re more\nlikely to grow up near environmental toxins,*35 in a dangerous\nneighborhood with more liquor stores than markets selling produce;\nyou’re less likely to attend a good school or have parents with time to\nread to you. Your community is likely to have poor social capital, and\nyou, poor self-esteem. But part of the link reflects the corrosive effects of\nsubordination in all hierarchical species. For example, having a low-\nranking mother predicts elevated glucocorticoids in adulthood in\nbaboons.36\nThus, childhood adversity can atrophy and blunt the functioning of\nthe hippocampus and frontal cortex. But it’s the opposite in the amygdala\n—lots of adversity and the amygdala becomes larger and hyperreactive.\nOne consequence is increased risk of anxiety disorders; when coupled\nwith the poor frontocortical development, it explains problems with\nemotion and behavior regulation, especially impulse control.37\nChildhood adversity accelerates amygdaloid maturation in a\nparticular way. Normally, around adolescence the frontal cortex gains the\nability to inhibit the amygdala, saying, “I wouldn’t do this if I were you.”\nBut after childhood adversity, the amygdala develops the ability to\ninhibit the frontal cortex, saying, “I’m doing this and just try to stop me.”\nChildhood adversity also damages the dopamine system (with its role\nin reward, anticipation, and goal-directed behavior) in two ways.\nFirst, early adversity produces an adult organism more vulnerable to\ndrug and alcohol addiction. The pathway to this vulnerability is probably\nthreefold: (a) effects on the developing dopamine system; (b) the\nexcessive adult exposure to glucocorticoids, which increases drug\ncraving; (c) that poorly developed frontal cortex.38\nChildhood adversity also substantially increases the risk of adult\ndepression. Depression’s defining symptom is anhedonia, the inability to\nadult glucocorticoid levels, which can deplete dopamine.39\nChildhood adversity increases depression risk via “second hit”\nscenarios—lowering thresholds so that adult stressors that people\ntypically manage instead trigger depressive episodes. This vulnerability\nmakes sense. Depression is fundamentally a pathological sense of loss of\ncontrol (explaining the classic description of depression as “learned\nhelplessness”). If a child experiences severe, uncontrollable adversity,\nthe most fortunate conclusion in adulthood is “Those were terrible\ncircumstances over which I had no control.” But when childhood\no varied types of childhood adversity converge in producing similar\nadult problems. Nonetheless, two types of adversity should be\nconsidered separately.\nObserving Violence\nWhat happens when children observe domestic violence, warfare, a\ngang murder, a school massacre? For weeks afterward there is impaired\nconcentration and impulse control. Witnessing gun violence doubles a\nchild’s likelihood of serious violence within the succeeding two years.\nAnd adulthood brings the usual increased risks of depression, anxiety,\nand aggression. Consistent with that, violent criminals are more likely\nthan nonviolent ones to have witnessed violence as kids.*40\nThis fits our general picture of childhood adversity. A separate topic\nis the effects of media violence on kids.\nEndless studies have analyzed the effects of kids witnessing violence\non TV, in movies, in the news, and in music videos, and both witnessing\nand participating in violent video games. A summary:\nExposing children to a violent TV or film clip increases their odds of\naggression soon after.41 Interestingly, the effect is stronger in girls (amid\ntheir having lower overall levels of aggression). Effects are stronger\nwhen kids are younger or when the violence is more realistic and/or is\npresented as heroic. Such exposure can make kids more accepting of\naggression—in one study, watching violent music videos increased\nadolescent girls’ acceptance of dating violence. The violence is key—\naggression isn’t boosted by material that’s merely exciting, arousing, or\nfrustrating.\nHeavy childhood exposure to media violence predicts higher levels\nof aggression in young adults of both sexes (“aggression” ranging from\nbehavior in an experimental setting to violent criminality). The effect\nmedia violence and increased adult aggression is stronger than the link\nbetween lead exposure and IQ, calcium intake and bone mass, or\nasbestos and laryngeal cancer.\nTwo caveats: (a) there is no evidence that catastrophically violent\nindividuals (e.g., mass shooters) are that way because of childhood\nexposure to violent media; (b) exposure does not remotely guarantee\nincreased aggression—instead, effects are strongest on kids already\nprone toward violence. For them, exposure desensitizes and normalizes\ntheir own aggression.*\nBullying\nBeing bullied is mostly another garden-variety childhood adversity,\nwith adult consequences on par with childhood maltreatment at home.42\nThere is a complication, though. As most of us observed, exploited,\nor experienced as kids, bullying targets aren’t selected at random. Kids\nwith the metaphorical “kick me” signs on their backs are more likely to\nhave personal or family psychiatric issues and poor social and emotional\nintelligence. These are kids already at risk for bad adult outcomes, and\nadding bullying to the mix just makes the child’s future even bleaker.\nThe picture of the bullies is no surprise either, starting with their\ndisproportionately coming from families of single moms or younger\nparents with poor education and employment prospects. There are\ngenerally two profiles of the kids themselves—the more typical is an\nanxious, isolated kid with poor social skills, who bullies out of\nfrustration and to achieve acceptance. Such kids typically mature out of\nbullying. The second profile is the confident, unempathic, socially\nintelligent kid with an imperturbable sympathetic nervous system; this is\nthe future sociopath.\nThere is an additional striking finding. You want to see a kid who’s\nreally likely to be a mess as an adult? Find someone who both bullies\nand is bullied, who terrorizes the weaker at school and returns home to\nbe terrorized by someone stronger.43 Of the three categories (bully,\nsuicidality.\nIn one study kids from these three categories read scenarios of\nbullying.44 Bullied victims would condemn bullying and express\nsympathy. Bullies would condemn bullying but rationalize the scenario\n(e.g., this time it was the victim’s fault). And bully/bullied kids? They\nwould say bullying is okay. No wonder they have the worst outcome.\n“The weak deserve to be bullied, so it’s fine when I bully. But that means\nI deserve to be bullied at home. But I don’t, and that relative bullying me\ne’ve now examined adult consequences of childhood adversity\nand their biological mediators. A key question persists. Yes,\nchildhood abuse increases the odds of being an abusive adult; witnessing\nviolence raises the risk for PTSD; loss of a parent to death means more\nchance of adult depression. Nevertheless, many, maybe even most\nvictims of such adversity turn into reasonably functional adults. There is\na shadow over childhood, demons lurk in corners of the mind, but overall\nthings are okay. What explains such resilience?\nAs we’ll see, genes and fetal environment are relevant. But most\nimportant, recall the logic of collapsing different types of trauma into a\nsingle category. What counts is the sheer number of times a child is\nbludgeoned by life and the number of protective factors. Be sexually\nabused as a child, or witness violence, and your adult prognosis is better\nthan if you had experienced both. Experience childhood poverty, and\nyour future prospects are better if your family is stable and loving than\nbroken and acrimonious. Pretty straightforwardly, the more categories of\nhat happens when everything goes wrong—no mother or family,\nminimal peer interactions, sensory and cognitive neglect, plus\nsome malnutrition?46\nThese are the Romanian\ninstitution kids, poster children for\njust how nightmarish childhood can\nbe. In the 1980s the Romanian\ndictator Nicolae Ceauşescu banned\ncontraceptives and abortions and\nrequired women to bear at least five\nchildren. Soon institutions filled\nwith thousands of infants and kids\nabandoned by impoverished\nfamilies (many intent on reclaiming\ntheir child when finances\nimproved).* Kids were warehoused\nin overwhelmed institutions,\nresulting in severe neglect and\ndeprivation. The story broke after\nCeauşescu’s 1989 overthrow. Many kids were adopted by Westerners,\nand international attention led to some improvements in the institutions.\nSince then, children adopted in the West, those eventually returned to\ntheir families, and those who remained institutionalized have been\nstudied, primarily by Charles Nelson of Harvard.\nAs adults, these kids are mostly what you’d expect. Low IQ and poor\ncognitive skills. Problems with forming attachments, often bordering on\nautistic. Anxiety and depression galore. The longer the\ninstitutionalization, the worse the prognosis.\nAnd their brains? Decreased total brain size, gray matter, white\nmatter, frontal cortical metabolism, connectivity between regions, sizes\nLITTLE C\nhapter 9 considers the effects of culture on our best and worst\nbehaviors. We now preview that chapter, focusing on two facts—\nchildhood is when culture is inculcated, and parents mediate that process.\nThere is huge cultural variability in how childhood is experienced—\nhow long and often kids are nursed; how often they are in contact with\nparents and other adults; how often they’re spoken to; how long they cry\nbefore someone responds; at what age they sleep alone.\nConsidering cross-cultural child rearing often brings out the most\ninvidious and neurotic in parents—do other cultures do a better job at it?\nThere must be the perfect combo out there, a mixture of the Kwakiutl\nbaby diet, the Trobriand sleeping program, and the Ituri approach to\nwatching Baby Mozart videos. But there is no anthropological ideal of\nchild rearing. Cultures (starting with parents) raise children to become\nadults who behave in the ways valued by that culture, a point\nemphasized by the anthropologist Meredith Small of Cornell\nUniversity.47\nWe begin with parenting style, a child’s first encounter with cultural\nvalues. Interestingly, the most influential typology of parenting style,\nwrit small, grew from thinking about cultural styles, writ large.\nAmid the post–World War II ruins, scholars tried to understand\nwhere Hitler, Franco, Mussolini, Tojo, and their minions came from.\nWhat are the roots of fascism? Two particularly influential scholars were\nrefugees from Hitler, namely Hannah Arendt (with her 1951 book The\nOrigins of Totalitarianism) and Theodor Adorno (with the 1950 book\nThe Authoritarian Personality, coauthored with Else Frenkel-Brunswik,\nDaniel Levinson, and Nevitt Sanford). Adorno in particular explored the\npersonality traits of fascists, including extreme conformity, submission to\nand belief in authority, aggressiveness, and hostility toward\nintellectualism and introspection—traits typically rooted in childhood.48\nsaid so” is anathema—with room for flexibility; praise and forgiveness\ntrump punishment; parents welcome children’s input; developing\nchildren’s potential and autonomy is paramount. By the standards of the\neducated neurotics who would read (let alone write . . .) this book, this\nproduces a good adult outcome—happy, emotionally and socially mature\nand fulfilled, independent and self-reliant.\nNext is authoritarian parenting. Rules and demands are numerous,\narbitrary, and rigid and need no justification; behavior is mostly shaped\nby punishment; children’s emotional needs are low priorities. Parental\nmotivation is often that it’s a tough, unforgiving world and kids better be\nprepared. Authoritarian parenting tends to produce adults who may be\nnarrowly successful, obedient, conformist (often with an undercurrent of\nresentment that can explode), and not particularly happy. Moreover,\nsocial skills are often poor because, instead of learning by experience,\nthey grew up following orders.\nAnd then there is permissive parenting, the aberration that\nsupposedly let Boomers invent the 1960s. There are few demands or\nexpectations, rules are rarely enforced, and children set the agenda.\nAdult outcome: self-indulgent individuals with poor impulse control, low\nfrustration tolerance, plus poor social skills thanks to living\nconsequence-free childhoods.\nBaumrind’s trio was expanded by Stanford psychologists Eleanor\nMaccoby and John Martin to include neglectful parenting.50 This\naddition produces a two-by-two matrix: parenting is authoritative (high\ndemand, high responsiveness), authoritarian (high demand, low\nresponsiveness), permissive (low demand, high responsiveness), or\nneglectful (low demand, low responsiveness).\nImportantly, each style usually produces adults with that same\napproach, with different cultures valuing different styles.\nThen comes the next way cultural values are transmitted to kids,\nnamely by peers. This was emphasized in Judith Rich Harris’s The\nNurture Assumption. Harris, a psychologist without an academic\naffiliation or doctorate, took the field by storm, arguing that the\nimportance of parenting in shaping a child’s adult personality is\nbecause of the parenting; instead, because of typically lower income,\nkids more likely live in a neighborhood with tough peers. (b) Peers have\nimpact on linguistic development (e.g., children acquire the accent of\ntheir peers, not their parents). (c) Other young primates are mostly\nsocialized by peers, not mothers.\nThe book was controversial (partially because the theme begged to\nbe distorted—“Psychologist proves that parents don’t matter”), drawing\ncriticism and acclaim.* As the dust has settled, current opinion tends to\nbe that peer influences are underappreciated, but parents still are plenty\nimportant, including by influencing what peer groups their kids\nexperience.\nWhy are peers so important? Peer interactions teach social\ncompetence—context-dependent behavior, when to be friend or foe,\nwhere you fit in hierarchies. Young organisms utilize the greatest\nteaching tool ever to acquire such information—play.52\nWhat is social play in the young? Writ large, it’s an array of\nbehaviors that train individuals in social competence. Writ medium, it’s\nfragments of the real thing, bits and pieces of fixed action patterns, a\nchance to safely try out roles and improve motor skills. Writ small and\nendocrine, it’s a demonstration that moderate and transient stress\n—“stimulation”—is great. Writ small and neurobiological, it’s a tool for\ndeciding which excess synapses to prune.\nThe historian Johan Huizinga characterized humans as “Homo\nLudens,” Man the Player, with our structured, rule-bound play—i.e.,\ngames. Nevertheless, play is universal among socially complex species,\nubiquitous among the young and peaking at puberty, and all play\ninvolves similar behaviors, after some ethological translating (e.g., a\ndominant dog signals the benevolence needed to initiate play by\ncrouching, diminishing herself; translated into baboon, a dominant kid\npresents her rear to someone lower ranking).\nPlay is vital. In order to play, animals forgo foraging, expend\ncalories, make themselves distracted and conspicuous to predators.\nYoung organisms squander energy on play during famines. A child\npathways activate during play; juvenile rats, when playing, emit the same\nvocalizations as when rewarded with food; dogs spend half their calories\nwagging their tails to pheromonally announce their presence and\navailability for play. As emphasized by the psychiatrist Stuart Brown,\nfounder of the National Institute for Play, the opposite of play is not\nwork—it’s depression. A challenge is to understand how the brain codes\nfor the reinforcing properties of the variety of play. After all, play\nencompasses everything from mathematicians besting each other with\nhilarious calculus jokes to kids besting each other by making hilarious\nfart sounds with their armpits.\nOne significant type of play involves fragments of aggression, what\nHarlow called “rough and tumble” play—kids wrestling, adolescent\nimpalas butting heads, puppies play-biting each other.53 Males typically\ndo it more than females, and as we’ll see soon, it’s boosted by prenatal\ntestosterone. Is rough-and-tumble play practice for life’s looming status\ntournament, or are you already in the arena? A mixture of both.\nExpanding beyond peers, neighborhoods readily communicate\nculture to kids. Is there garbage everywhere? Are houses decrepit?\nWhat’s ubiquitous—bars, churches, libraries, or gun shops? Are there\nmany parks, and are they safe to enter? Do billboards, ads, and bumper\nstickers sell religious or material paradises, celebrate acts of martyrdom\nor kindness and inclusiveness?\n—\nAnd then we get to culture at the level of tribes, nations, and states. Here,\nbriefly, are some of the broadest cultural differences in child-rearing\npractices.\nCollectivist Versus Individualist Cultures\nAs will be seen in chapter 9, this is the most studied cultural contrast,\ntypically comparing collectivist East Asian cultures with\nüberindividualist America. Collectivist cultures emphasize\ninterdependence, harmony, fitting in, the needs and responsibilities of the\nanimated expressions.54 They view themselves as teachers rather than\nprotectors, abhor a bored child, value high-energy affect. Their games\nemphasize individual competition, urge hobbies involving doing rather\nthan observing. Kids are trained in verbal assertiveness, to be\nautonomous and influential. Show a cartoon of a school of fish with one\nout front, and she’ll describe it to her child as the leader.*\nMothers in collectivist cultures, in contrast, spend more time than\nindividualist mothers soothing their child, maintaining contact, and\nfacilitating contact with other adults. They value low arousal affect and\nsleep with their child to a later age. Games are about cooperation and\nfitting in; if playing with her child with, say, a toy car, the point is not\nexploring what a car does (i.e., being automobile), but the process of\nsharing (“Thank you for giving me your car; now I’ll give it back to\nyou”). Kids are trained to get along, think of others, accept and adapt,\nrather than change situations; morality and conformity are nearly\nsynonymous. Show the cartoon of the school of fish, and the fish out\nfront must have done something wrong, because no one will play with\nhim.\nLogically, kids in individualist cultures acquire ToM later than\ncollectivist-culture kids and activate pertinent circuits more to achieve\nthe same degree of competence. For a collectivist child, social\ncompetence is all about taking someone else’s perspective.55\nInterestingly, kids in (collectivist) Japan play more violent video\ngames than do American kids, yet are less aggressive. Moreover,\nexposing Japanese kids to media violence boosts aggression less than in\nAmerican kids.56 Why the difference? Three possible contributing\nfactors: (a) American kids play alone more often, a lone-wolf breeding\nground; (b) Japanese kids rarely have a computer or TV in their\nbedroom, so they play near their parents; (c) Japanese video-game\nviolence is more likely to have prosocial, collectivist themes.\nfamily, or clan; failing to do so is shameful. These are cultures filled with\nvendettas, revenge, and honor killings; cheeks aren’t turned. A classic\nculture of honor is the American South, but as we’ll see in chapter 9,\nsuch cultures occur worldwide and with certain ecological correlates. A\nparticularly lethal combo is when a culture of victimization—we were\nwronged last week, last decade, last millennium—is coupled with a\nculture of honor’s ethos of retribution.\nParenting in cultures of honor tends to be authoritarian.57 Kids are\naggressive, particularly following honor violations, and staunchly\nendorse aggressive responses to scenarios of honor violation.\nClass Differences\nAs noted, an infant baboon learns her place in the hierarchy from her\nmother. A human child’s lessons about status are more complex—there\nis implicit cuing, subtle language cues, the cognitive and emotional\nweight of remembering the past (“When your grandparents emigrated\nhere they couldn’t even . . .”) and hoping about the future (“When you\ngrow up, you’re going to . . .”). Baboon mothers teach their young\nappropriate behavioral context; human parents teach their young what to\nbother dreaming about.\nClass differences in parenting in Western countries resemble\nparenting differences between Western countries and those in the\ndeveloping world. In the West a parent teaches and facilitates her child\nexploring the world. In the toughest corners of the developing world,\nlittle more is expected than the awesome task of keeping your child alive\nand buffered from the menacing world.*\nIn Western cultures, class differences in parenting sort by Baumrind’s\ntypologies. In higher-SES strata, parenting tends to be authoritative or\npermissive. In contrast, parenting in society’s lower-SES rungs is\ntypically authoritarian, reflecting two themes. One concerns protecting.\nWhen are higher-SES parents authoritarian? When there is danger.\n“Sweetie, I love that you question things, but if you run into the street\nClass differences in parenting were explored in a classic study by the\nanthropologist Adrie Kusserow of St. Michael’s College, who did\nfieldwork observing parents in three tribes—wealthy families on\nManhattan’s Upper East Side; a stable, blue-collar community; and a\npoor, crime-ridden one (the last two both in Queens).58 The differences\nwere fascinating.\nParenting in the poor neighborhood involved “hard defensive\nindividualism.” The neighborhood was rife with addiction,\nhomelessness, incarceration, death—and parents’ aim was to shelter their\nchild from the literal and metaphorical street. Their speech was full of\nmetaphors about not losing what was achieved—standing your ground,\nkeeping up your pride, not letting others get under your skin. Parenting\nwas authoritarian, toughening the goal. For example, parents teased kids\nfar more than in the other neighborhoods.\nIn contrast, working-class parenting involved “hard offensive\nindividualism.” Parents had some socioeconomic momentum, and kids\nwere meant to maintain that precarious trajectory. Parents’ speech about\ntheir hopes for their kids contained images of movement, progress, and\nathletics—getting ahead, testing the waters, going for the gold. With hard\nwork and the impetus of generations of expectations, your child might\npioneer landfall in the middle class.\nParenting in both neighborhoods emphasized respect for authority,\nparticularly within the family. Moreover, kids were fungible members of\na category, rather than individualized—“You kids get over here.”\nThen there was the “soft individualism” of upper-middle-class\nparenting.* Children’s eventual success, by conventional standards, was\na given, as were expectations of physical health. Far more vulnerable\nwas a child’s psychological health; when children could become\nanything, parents’ responsibility was to facilitate their epic journey\ntoward an individuated “fulfillment.” Moreover, the image of fulfillment\nwas often postconventional—“I hope my child will never work an\nunsatisfying job just for money.” This, after all, is a tribe giddied by tales\nof the shark in line to become CEO chucking it to learn carpentry or\noboe. Parents’ speech brimmed with metaphors of potential being\nyou clean things up a bit please? Malala is coming for dinner.”*\nWe’ve now seen how childhood events—from the first mother-infant\ninteraction to the effects of culture—have persistent influences, and how\nbiology mediates such influences. When combined with the preceding\nchapters, we have finished our tour of environmental effects on behavior,\nfrom the second before a behavior occurs to a second after birth. In\neffect, we’ve done “environment”; time for next chapter’s “genes.”\nThe existence of prenatal environmental influences caught the\npublic’s imagination with some charming studies demonstrating that\nnear-term fetuses hear (what’s going on outside the womb), taste\n(amniotic fluid), and remember and prefer those stimuli after birth.\nThis was shown experimentally—inject lemon-flavored saline into a\npregnant rat’s amniotic fluid, and her pups are born preferring that flavor.\nMoreover, some spices consumed by pregnant women get into amniotic\nfluid. Thus we may be born preferring foods our mothers ate during\npregnancy—pretty unorthodox cultural transmission.59\nPrenatal effects can also be auditory, as shown by inspired research\nby Anthony DeCasper of the University of North Carolina.60 A pregnant\nwoman’s voice is audible in the womb, and newborns recognize and\nprefer the sound of their mother’s voice.* DeCasper used ethology’s\nplaybook to show this: A newborn can learn to suck a pacifier in two\ndifferent patterns of long and short sucks. Generate one pattern, and you\nhear Mom’s voice; the other, another woman’s voice. Newborns want\nMom’s voice. Elements of language are also learned in utero—the\ncontours of a newborn’s cry are similar to the contours of speech in the\nmother’s language.\nThe cognitive capacities of near-term fetuses are even more\nremarkable. For example, fetuses can distinguish between two pairs of\nnonsense syllables (“biba” versus “babi”). How do you know? Get this—\nMom says “Biba, biba, biba” repeatedly while fetal heart rate is\nmonitored. “Boring (or perhaps lulling),” thinks the fetus, and heart rate\nslows. Then Mom switches to “babi.” If the fetus doesn’t distinguish\nbetween the two, heart rate deceleration continues. But if the difference\nis noted—“Whoa, what happened?”—heart rate increases. Which is what\nDeCasper reported.61\nDeCasper and colleague Melanie Spence then showed (using the\n212\nThe Cat in the Hat and from the rhythmically similar The King, the Mice,\nand the Cheese.62 But newborns whose mothers had read The Cat in the\nHat out loud for hours during the last trimester preferred Dr. Seuss.\nWow.\nDespite the charm of these findings, this book’s concerns aren’t\nrooted in such prenatal learning—few infants are born with a preference\nfor passages from, say, Mein Kampf. However, other prenatal\nenvironmental effects are quite consequential.\n\nTHAT MIGHT MEAN\ne start with a simple version of what “environment” means for a\nfetal brain: the nutrients, immune messengers, and, most\nimportant, hormones carried to the brain in the fetal circulation.\nOnce the pertinent glands have developed in a fetus, they are\nperfectly capable of secreting their characteristic hormones. This is\nparticularly consequential. When hormones first made their entrance in\nchapter 4, our discussion concerned their “activational” effects that\nlasted on the order of hours to days. In contrast, hormones in the fetus\nhave “organizational” effects on the brain, causing lifelong changes in\nstructure and function.\nAround eight weeks postconception, human fetal gonads start\nsecreting their steroid hormones (testosterone in males; estrogen and\nprogesterone in females). Crucially, testosterone plus “anti-Müllerian\nhormone” (also from the testes) masculinize the brain.\nThree complications, of increasing messiness:\nIn many rodents the brain isn’t quite sexually\ndifferentiated at birth, and these hormonal effects\ncontinue postnatally.\nA messier complication: Surprisingly few testosterone\neffects in the brain result from the hormone binding to\nandrogen receptors. Instead, testosterone enters targets\ncells and, bizarrely, is converted to estrogen, then binds\nto intracellular estrogen receptors (while testosterone\nhas its effects outside the brain either as itself or, after\nintracellular conversion to a related androgen,\ndihydrotestosterone). Thus testosterone has much of its\nmasculinizing effect in the brain by becoming estrogen.\nThe conversion of testosterone to estrogen also occurs in\nfemale fetal brain? Most likely it’s because fetuses make\nsomething called alpha-fetoprotein, which binds\ncirculating estrogen, taking it out of action. So neither\nMom’s estrogen nor fetal-derived estrogen masculinizes\nthe brain in female fetuses. And it turns out that unless\nthere is testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone around,\nfetal mammalian brains automatically feminize.63\nNow for the übermessy complication. What exactly is a\n“female” or “male” brain? This is where the arguments\nbegin.\nTo start, male brains merely consistently drool reproductive\nhormones out of the hypothalamus, whereas female brains must master\nthe cyclic secretion of ovulatory cycles. Thus fetal life produces a\nhypothalamus that is more complexly wired in females.\nBut how about sex differences in the behaviors that interest us? The\nquestion is, how much of male aggression is due to prenatal\nmasculinizing of the brain?\nVirtually all of it, if we’re talking rodents. Work in the 1950s by\nRobert Goy of the University of Wisconsin showed that in guinea pigs an\norganizational effect of perinatal testosterone is to make the brain\nresponsive to testosterone in adulthood.64 Near-term pregnant females\nwould be treated with testosterone. This produced female offspring who,\nas adults, appeared normal but were behaviorally “masculinized”—they\nwere more sensitive than control females to an injection of testosterone,\nwith a greater increase in aggression and male-typical sexual behavior\n(i.e., mounting other females). Moreover, estrogen was less effective at\neliciting female-typical sexual behavior (i.e., a back-arching reflex called\nlordosis). Thus prenatal testosterone exposure had masculinizing\norganizational effects, so that these females as adults responded to the\nactivational effects of testosterone and estrogen as males would.\nThis challenged dogma that sexual identity is due to social, not\nbiological, influences. This was the view of sociologists who hated high\nschool biology . . . and of the medical establishment as well. According\nSo here’s Goy reporting that prenatal hormone environment, not\nsocial factors, determines adult sex-typical behaviors. “But these are\nguinea pigs” was the retort. Goy and crew then studied nonhuman\nprimates.\nA quick tour of sexually dimorphic (i.e., differing by sex) primate\nbehavior: South American species such as marmosets and tamarins, who\nform pair-bonds, show few sex differences in behavior. In contrast, most\nOld World primates are highly dimorphic; males are more aggressive,\nand females spend more time at affiliative behaviors (e.g., social\ngrooming, interacting with infants). How’s this for a sex difference: in\none study, adult male rhesus monkeys were far more interested in\nplaying with “masculine” human toys (e.g., wheeled toys) than\n“feminine” ones (stuffed animals), while females had a slight preference\nfor feminine.66\nWhat next, female monkeys prefer young-adult fantasy novels with\nfemale protagonists? Why should human toys be relevant to sex\ndifferences in monkeys? The authors speculate that this reflects the\nVisit bit.ly/2o8ogEL for a larger version of this graph.\nGoy studied highly sexually dimorphic rhesus monkeys. There were\nalready hints that testosterone has organizational effects on their\nbehavior—within weeks of birth, males are more active than females and\nspend more time in rough-and-tumble play. This is long before puberty\nand its burst of testosterone secretion. Furthermore, even if you suppress\ntheir testosterone levels at birth (low, but nevertheless still higher than\nthose of females), males still do more roughing and tumbling. This\nsuggested that the sex difference arose from fetal hormone differences.\nGoy proved this by treating pregnant monkeys with testosterone and\nexamining their female offspring. Testosterone exposure throughout\npregnancy produced daughters who were “pseudohermaphrodites”—\nlooked like males on the outside but had female gonads on the inside.\nWhen compared with control females, these androgenized females did\nmore rough-and-tumble play, were more aggressive, and displayed male-\nbut not all behaviors.\nIn further studies, many carried out by Goy’s student Kim Wallen of\nEmory University, pregnant females received lower doses of\ntestosterone, and only in the last trimester.67 This produced daughters\nwith normal genitalia but masculinized behavior. The authors noted the\nrelevance of this to transgender individuals—the external appearance of\none sex but the brain, if you will, of the other.*\nAnd Us\nInitially it seemed clear that prenatal testosterone exposure is also\nresponsible for male aggression in humans. This was based on studies of\na rare disorder, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). An enzyme in the\nadrenal glands has a mutation, and instead of making glucocorticoids,\nthey make testosterone and other androgens, starting during fetal life.\nThe lack of glucocorticoids causes serious metabolic problems\nrequiring replacement hormones. And what about the excessive\nandrogens in CAH girls (who are typically born with ambiguous genitals\nand are infertile as adults)?\nIn the 1950s psychologist John Money of Johns Hopkins University\nreported that CAH girls had pathologically high levels of male-typical\nbehaviors, a paucity of female-typical ones, and elevated IQ.\nThat sure stopped everyone in their tracks. But the research had some\nproblems. First, the IQ finding was spurious—parents willing to enroll\ntheir CAH child in these studies averaged higher levels of education than\ndid controls. And the gender-typical behaviors? “Normal” was judged by\n1950s Ozzie and Harriet standards—CAH girls were pathologically\ninterested in having careers and disinterested in having babies.\nOops, back to the drawing board. Careful contemporary CAH\nresearch has been conducted by Melissa Hines of the University of\nCambridge.68 When compared with non-CAH girls, CAH girls do more\nrough-and-tumble play, fighting, and physical aggression. Moreover,\nImportantly, drug treatments begun soon after birth normalize\nandrogen levels in these girls, so that the excessive androgen exposure is\nsolely prenatal. Thus prenatal testosterone exposure appears to cause\norganizational changes that increase the incidence of male-typical\nbehaviors.\nA similar conclusion is reached by an inverse of CAH, namely\nandrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS, historically called “testicular\nfeminization syndrome”).69 A fetus is male—XY chromosomes, testes\nthat secrete testosterone. But a mutation in the androgen receptor makes\nit insensitive to testosterone. Thus the testes can secrete testosterone till\nthe cows come home but there won’t be any masculinization. And often\nthe individual is born with a female external phenotype and is raised as a\ngirl. Along comes puberty, she’s not getting periods, and a trip to the\ndoctor reveals that the “girl” is actually a “boy” (with testes typically\nnear the stomach, plus a shortened vagina that dead-ends). The\nindividual usually continues with a female identity but is infertile as an\nadult. In other words, when human males don’t experience the\norganizational prenatal effects of testosterone, you get female-typical\nbehaviors and identification.\nBetween CAH and AIS, the issue seems settled—prenatal\ntestosterone plays a major role in explaining sex differences in\naggression and various affiliative prosocial behaviors in humans.\nCareful readers may have spotted two whopping big problems with\nthis conclusion:70\nRemember that CAH girls are born with a “something’s\nvery different” Post-it—the ambiguous genitalia,\ntypically requiring multiple reconstructive surgeries.\nCAH females are not merely prenatally androgenized.\nThey’re also raised by parents who know something is\ndifferent, have slews of doctors mighty interested in\ntheir privates, and are treated with all sorts of hormones.\nIt’s impossible to attribute the behavioral profile solely\nto the prenatal androgens.\naspect of brain masculinization should have occurred\ndespite the mutation. Complicating things, some of the\nmasculinizing effects of prenatal testosterone in\nmonkeys don’t require conversion to estrogen. So we\nhave genetically and gonadally male individuals with at\nleast some brain masculinization raised successfully as\nfemales.\nThe picture is complicated further—AIS individuals raised female\nhave higher-than-expected rates of being gay, and of having an other-\nthan-female or neither-female-nor-male-sex/gender self-identification.\nArgh. All we can say is that there is (imperfect) evidence that\ntestosterone has masculinizing prenatal effects in humans, as in other\nprimates. The question becomes how big these effects are.\nAnswering that question would be easy if you knew how much\ntestosterone people were exposed to as fetuses. Which brings up a truly\nquirky finding, one likely to cause readers to start futzing awkwardly\nwith a ruler.\nWeirdly, prenatal testosterone exposure influences digit length.71\nSpecifically, while the second finger is usually shorter than the fourth\nfinger, the difference (the “2D:4D ratio”) is greater in men than in\nwomen, something first noted in the 1880s. The difference is\ndemonstrable in third-trimester fetuses, and the more fetal testosterone\nexposure (as assessed by amniocentesis), the more pronounced the ratio.\nMoreover, CAH females have a more masculine ratio, as do females who\nshared their fetal environment (and thus some testosterone) with a male\ntwin, while AIS males have a more feminine ratio. The sex difference in\nthe ratio occurs in other primates and rodents. And no one knows why\nthis difference exists. Moreover, this oddity is not alone. A barely\ndiscernible background noise generated by the inner ear (“otoacoustic\nemissions”) shows a sex difference that reflects prenatal testosterone\nexposure. Go explain that.\nThe 2D:4D ratio is so variable, and the sex difference so small, that\ntoward higher levels of aggression and math scores; more assertive\npersonalities; higher rates of ADHD and autism (diseases with strong\nmale biases); and decreased risk of depression and anxiety (disorders\nwith a female skew). The faces and handwriting of such men are judged\nto be more “masculine.” Furthermore, some reports show a decreased\nlikelihood of being gay.\nWomen having a more “feminine” ratio have less chance of autism\nand more of anorexia (a female-biased disease). They’re less likely to be\nleft-handed (a male-skewed trait). Moreover, they exhibit less athletic\nability and more attraction to highly masculine faces. And they’re more\nlikely to be straight or, if lesbian, more likely to take stereotypical female\nsexual roles.72\nThis constitutes some of the strongest evidence that (a) fetal\nandrogen exposure has organizational effects on adult behavior in\nhumans as in other species, and (b) that individual differences in the\nextent of such exposure predict individual differences in adult\nbehavior.*73 Prenatal endocrine environment is destiny.\nWell, not exactly. These effects are small and variable, producing a\nmeaningful relationship only when considering large numbers of\nindividuals. Do testosterone’s organizational effects determine the\nquality and/or quantity of aggression? No. How about the organizational\nplus the activational effects? Not those either.\nExpanding the Scope of “Environment”\nThus the fetal brain can be influenced by hormones secreted by the\nfetus. But in addition, the outside world alters a pregnant woman’s\nphysiology, which in turn affects the fetal brain.\nThe most obvious version of this is how food ingested by a pregnant\nfemale influences what nutrients are delivered to the fetal circulation.*\nAt an extreme, maternal malnutrition broadly impairs fetal brain\ndevelopment.*74 Moreover, pathogens acquired by the mother can be\npassed to the fetus—for example, the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma\nImportantly, maternal stress impacts fetal development. There are\nindirect routes—for example, stressed people consume less healthy diets\nand consume more substances of abuse. More directly, stress alters\nmaternal blood pressure and immune defenses, which impact a fetus.\nMost important, stressed mothers secrete glucocorticoids, which enter\nfetal circulation and basically have the same bad consequences as in\nstressed infants and children.\nGlucocorticoids accomplish this through organizational effects on\nfetal brain construction and decreasing levels of growth factors, numbers\nof neurons and synapses, and so on. Just as prenatal testosterone\nexposure generates an adult brain that is more sensitive to environmental\ntriggers of aggression, excessive prenatal glucocorticoid exposure\nproduces an adult brain more sensitive to environmental triggers of\ndepression and anxiety.\nIn addition, prenatal glucocorticoid exposure has effects that blend\nclassical developmental biology with molecular biology. To appreciate\nthis, here’s a highly simplified version of the next chapter’s focus on\ngenes: (a) each gene specifies the production of a specific type of\nprotein; (b) a gene has to be “activated” for the protein to be produced\nand “deactivated” to stop producing it—thus genes come with on/off\nswitches; (c) every cell in our bodies contains the same library of genes;\n(d) during development, the pattern of which genes are activated\ndetermines which cells turn into nose, which into toes, and so on; (e)\nforever after, nose, toes, and other cells retain distinctive patterns of gene\nactivation.\nChapter 4 discussed how some hormones have activational effects by\naltering on/off switches on particular genes (e.g., testosterone-activating\ngenes related to increased growth in muscle cells). The field of\n“epigenetics” concerns how some hormonal organizational effects arise\nfrom permanently turning particular genes on or off in particular cells.75\nPlenty more on this in the next chapter.\nThis helps explain why your toes and nose work differently. More\nimportant, epigenetic changes also occur in the brain.\nThis domain of epigenetics was uncovered in a landmark 2004 study\nglucocorticoid levels, less anxiety, better learning, and delayed brain\naging. The paper showed that these changes were epigenetic—that\nmothering style altered the on/off switch in a gene relevant to the brain’s\nstress response.* Whoa—mothering style alters gene regulation in pups’\nbrains. Remarkably, Meaney, along with Darlene Francis of the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, then showed that such rat pups, as\nadults, are more attentive mothers—passing this trait epigenetically to\nthe next generation.* Thus, adult behavior produces persistent molecular\nbrain changes in offspring, “programming” them to be likely to replicate\nthat distinctive behavior in adulthood.76\nMore findings flooded in, many provided by Meaney, his\ncollaborator Moshe Szyf, also of McGill, and Frances Champagne of\nColumbia University.77 Hormonal responses to various fetal and\nchildhood experiences have epigenetic effects on genes related to the\ngrowth factor BDNF, to the vasopressin and oxytocin system, and to\nestrogen sensitivity. These effects are pertinent to adult cognition,\npersonality, emotionality, and psychiatric health. Childhood abuse, for\nexample, causes epigenetic changes in hundreds of genes in the human\nhippocampus. Moreover, Stephen Suomi of the National Institutes of\nHealth and Szyf found that mothering style in monkeys has epigenetic\neffects on more than a thousand frontocortical genes.*\npigenetic environmental effects on the developing brain are hugely\nexciting. Nonetheless, curbing of enthusiasm is needed. Findings\nhave been overinterpreted, and as more researchers flock to the subject,\nthe quality of studies has declined. Moreover, there is the temptation to\nconclude that epigenetics explains “everything,” whatever that might be;\nmost effects of childhood experience on adult outcomes probably don’t\ninvolve epigenetics and (stay tuned) most epigenetic changes are\ntransient. Particularly strong criticisms come from molecular geneticists\nrather than behavioral scientists (who generally embrace the topic); some\nof the negativity from the former, I suspect, is fueled by the indignity of\nhaving to incorporate the likes of rat mothers licking their pups into their\nbeautiful world of gene regulation.\nBut the excitement should be restrained on a deeper level, one\nrelevant to the entire chapter. Stimulating environments, harsh parents,\ngood neighborhoods, uninspiring teachers, optimal diets—all alter genes\nin the brain. Wow. And not that long ago the revolution was about how\nenvironment and experience change the excitability of synapses, their\nnumber, neuronal circuits, even the number of neurons. Whoa. And\nearlier the revolution was about how environment and experience can\nchange the sizes of different parts of the brain. Amazing.\nBut none of this is truly amazing. Because things must work these\nways. While little in childhood determines an adult behavior, virtually\neverything in childhood changes propensities toward some adult\nbehavior. Freud, Bowlby, Harlow, Meaney, from their differing\nperspectives, all make the same fundamental and once-revolutionary\npoint: childhood matters. All that the likes of growth factors, on/off\nswitches, and rates of myelination do is provide insights into the innards\nof that fact.\nSuch insight is plenty useful. It shows the steps linking childhood\npoint A to adult point Z. It shows how parents can produce offspring\nThere is another use. In chapter 2 I recounted how it required the\ndemonstration of hippocampal volume loss in combat vets with PTSD to\nfinally convince many in power that the disorder is “real.” Similarly, it\nshouldn’t require molecular genetics or neuroendocrinology factoids to\nprove that childhood matters and thus that it profoundly matters to\nprovide childhoods filled with good health and safety, love and"

    "content": "Back to When You Were\nJust a Fertilized Egg\n’m reminded of a cartoon where one lab-coated scientist is telling the\nother, “You know how you’re on the phone, and the other person\nwants to get off but won’t say it, so they say, ‘Well, you probably need to\nget going,’ like you’re the one who wants to get off, when it’s really\nthem? I think I found the gene for that.”\nThis chapter is about progress in finding “the gene for that.”\n—\nOur prototypical behavior has occurred. How was it influenced by events\nwhen the egg and sperm that formed that person joined, creating their\ngenome—the chromosomes, the sequences of DNA—destined to be\nduplicated in every cell in that future person’s body? What role did those\ngenes play in causing that behavior?\nGenes are relevant to, say, aggression, which is why we’re less\nalarmed if a toddler pulls at the ears of a basset hound rather than a pit\nbull. Genes are relevant to everything in this book. Many\nneurotransmitters and hormones are coded for by genes. As are\nmolecules that construct or degrade those messengers, as are their\nreceptors. Ditto for growth factors guiding brain plasticity. Genes\ntypically come in different versions; we each consist of an individuated\norchestration of the different versions of our approximately twenty\nthousand genes.\nThis topic carries two burdens. The first reflects many people being\nto justify various “isms,” prejudice, and discrimination. Such\npseudoscience has fostered racism and sexism, birthed eugenics and\nforced sterilizations, allowed scientifically meaningless versions of\nwords like “innate” to justify the neglect of have-nots. And monstrous\ndistortions of genetics have fueled those who lynch, ethnically cleanse,\nor march children into gas chambers.*1\nBut studying the genetics of behavior also carries the opposite burden\nof people who are overly enthusiastic about the subject. After all, this is\nthe genomics era, with personalized genomic medicine, people getting\ntheir genomes sequenced, and popular writing about genomics giddy\nwith terms like “the holy grail” and “the code of codes.” In a reductionist\nview, understanding something complex requires breaking it down into\nits components; understand those parts, add them together, and you’ll\nunderstand the big picture. And in this reductionist world, to understand\ncells, organs, bodies, and behavior, the best constituent part to study is\ngenes.\nOverenthusiasm for genes can reflect a sense that people possess an\nimmutable, distinctive essence (although essentialism predates\ngenomics). Consider a study concerning “moral spillover” based on\nkinship.2 Suppose a person harmed people two generations ago; are this\nperson’s grandchildren obliged to help his victims’ grandchildren?\nSubjects viewed a biological grandchild as more obligated than one\nadopted into the family at birth; the biological relationship carried a taint.\nMoreover, subjects were more willing to jail two long-lost identical\ntwins for a crime committed by one of them than to jail two unrelated but\nperfect look-alikes—the former, raised in different environments, share a\nmoral taint because of their identical genes. People see essentialism\nembedded in bloodlines—i.e., genes.*\nThis chapter threads between these two extremes, concluding that\nwhile genes are important to this book’s concerns, they’re far less so than\noften thought. The chapter first introduces gene function and regulation,\nshowing the limits of genes’ power. Next it examines genetic influences\ne start by considering the limited power of genes. If you are\nshaky about topics such as the central dogma (DNA codes for\nRNA, which codes for protein sequence), protein structure determining\nfunction, the three-nucleotide codon code, or the basics of point,\ninsertion, and deletion mutations, first read the primer in appendix 3.\nDo Genes Know What They Are Doing? The\nTriumph of the Environment\nSo genes specify protein structure, shape, and function. And since\nproteins do virtually everything, this makes DNA the holy grail of life.\nBut no—genes don’t “decide” when a new protein is made.\nDogma was that there’d be a stretch of DNA in a chromosome,\nconstituting a single gene, followed by a stop codon, followed\nimmediately by the next gene, and then the next. . . . But genes don’t\nactually come one after another—not all DNA constitutes genes. Instead\nthere are stretches of DNA between genes that are noncoding, that are\nnot “transcribed.”* And now a flabbergasting number—95 percent of\nDNA is noncoding. Ninety-five percent.\nWhat is that 95 percent? Some is junk—remnants of pseudogenes\ninactivated by evolution.*3 But buried in that are the keys to the\nkingdom, the instruction manual for when to transcribe particular genes,\nthe on/off switches for gene transcription. A gene doesn’t “decide” when\nto be photocopied into RNA, to generate its protein. Instead, before the\nstart of the stretch of DNA coding for that gene is a short stretch called a\npromoter*—the “on” switch. What turns the promoter switch on?\nSomething called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter. This\ncauses the recruitment of enzymes that transcribe the gene into RNA.\nMeanwhile, other transcription factors deactivate genes.\ndeterminism: the environment.\nTo start unexcitingly, “environment” can mean intracellular\nenvironment. Suppose a hardworking neuron is low on energy. This state\nactivates a particular transcription factor, which binds to a specific\npromoter, which activates the next gene in line (the “downstream” gene).\nThis gene codes for a glucose transporter; more glucose transporter\nproteins are made and inserted into the cell membrane, improving the\nneuron’s ability to access circulating glucose.\nNext consider “environment,” including the neuron next door, which\nreleases serotonin onto the neuron in question. Suppose less serotonin\nhas been released lately. Sentinel transcription factors in dendritic spines\nsense this, travel to the DNA, and bind to the promoter upstream of the\nserotonin receptor gene. More receptor is made and placed in the\ndendritic spines, and they become more sensitive to the faint serotonin\nsignal.\nSometimes “environment” can be far-flung within an organism. A\nmale secretes testosterone, which travels through the bloodstream and\nbinds to androgen receptors in muscle cells. This activates a\ntranscription-factor cascade that results in more intracellular scaffolding\nproteins, enlarging the cell (i.e., muscle mass increases).\nFinally, and most important, there is “environment,” meaning the\noutside world. A female smells her newborn, meaning that odorant\nmolecules that floated off the baby bind to receptors in her nose. The\nreceptors activate and (many steps later in the hypothalamus) a\ntranscription factor activates, leading to the production of more oxytocin.\nOnce secreted, the oxytocin causes milk letdown. Genes are not the\ndeterministic holy grail if they can be regulated by the smell of a baby’s\ntushy. Genes are regulated by all the incarnations of environment.\nIn other words, genes don’t make sense outside the context of\nenvironment. Promoters and transcription factor introduce if/then\nclauses: “If you smell your baby, then activate the oxytocin gene.”\nNow the plot thickens.\nThere are multiple types of transcription factors in a cell, each\nbinding to a particular DNA sequence constituting a particular promoter.\ndifferent transcription profiles—A is transcribed, B is transcribed, A and\nB are transcribed—requiring three different TFs (assuming you activate\nonly one at a time).\nThree genes, seven transcription profiles: A, B, C, A + B, A + C, B +\nC, A + B + C. Seven different TFs.\nFour genes, fifteen profiles. Five genes, thirty-one profiles.*\nAs the number of genes in a genome increases, the number of\npossible expression profiles increases exponentially. As does the number\nof TFs needed to produce those profiles.\nNow another wrinkle that, in the lingo of an ancient generation, will\nblow your mind.\nTFs are usually proteins, coded for by genes. Back to genes A and B.\nTo fully exploit them, you need the TF that activates gene A, and the TF\nthat activates gene B, and the TF that activates genes A and B. Thus\nthere must exist three more genes, each coding for one of those TFs.\nRequiring TFs that activate those genes. And TFs for the genes coding\nfor those TFs . . .\nWhoa. Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s\ntranscription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the\nspecies whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome\n(i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of\ngenes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the\norganism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene\nregulation by the environment.\nBack to mutations. Can there be mutations in DNA stretches\nconstituting promoters? Yes, and more often than in genes themselves. In\nthe 1970s Allan Wilson and Mary-Claire King at Berkeley correctly\ntheorized that the evolution of genes is less important than the evolution\nof regulatory sequences upstream of genes (and thus how the\nenvironment regulates genes). Reflecting that, a disproportionate share of\ngenetic differences between chimps and humans are in genes for TFs.\nTime for more complexity. Suppose you have genes 1–10, and\ntranscription factors A, B, and C. TF-A induces the transcription of\ngenes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. TF-B induces genes 1, 2, 5, and 6. TF-C induces\ninjury causes a TF called NF-κB to activate a network of inflammation\ngenes). Suppose the promoter upstream of gene 3 that responds to\npromoter TF-A has a mutation making it responsive to TF-B. Result?\nGene 3 is now activated as part of a different network. Same\nnetworkwide outcome if there is a mutation in a gene for a TF, producing\na protein that binds to a different promoter type.4\nConsider this: the human genome codes for about 1,500 different\nTFs, contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about\n200,000 such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile.5\nThis is boggling.\nEpigenetics\nThe last chapter introduced the phenomenon of environmental\ninfluences freezing genetic on/off in one position. Such “epigenetic”\nchanges* were relevant to events, particularly in childhood, causing\npersistent effects on the brain and behavior. For example, recall those\npair-bonding prairie voles; when females and males first mate, there are\nepigenetic changes in regulation of oxytocin and vasopressin receptor\ngenes in the nucleus accumbens, that target of mesolimbic dopamine\nprojection.6\nLet’s translate the last chapter’s imagery of “freezing on/off\nswitches” into molecular biology.7 What mechanisms underlie epigenetic\nchanges in gene regulation? An environmental input results in a chemical\nbeing attached tightly to a promoter, or to some nearby structural\nproteins surrounding DNA. The result of either is that TFs can no longer\naccess or properly bind to the promoter, thus silencing the gene.\nAs emphasized in the last chapter, epigenetic changes can be\nmultigenerational.8 Dogma was that all the epigenetic marks (i.e.,\nchanges in the DNA or surrounding proteins) were erased in eggs and\nsperm. But it turns out that epigenetic marks can be passed on by both\n(e.g., make male mice diabetic, and they pass the trait to their offspring\nvia epigenetic changes in sperm).\ntree; this lengthens her neck. According to Lamarck, when she has\nbabies, they will have longer necks because of “acquired inheritance.”*\nLunatic! Buffoon! Epigenetically mediated mechanisms of inheritance—\nnow often called “neo-Lamarckian inheritance”—prove Lamarck right in\nthis narrow domain. Centuries late, the guy’s getting some acclaim.\nThus, not only does environment regulate genes, but it can do so with\neffects that last days to lifetimes.\nThe Modular Construction of Genes: Exons and\nIntrons\nTime to do in another dogma about DNA. It turns out that most genes\nare not coded for by a continuous stretch of DNA. Instead there might be\na stretch of noncoding DNA in the middle. In that case, the two separate\nstretches of coding DNA are called “exons,” separated by an “intron.”\nMany genes are broken into numerous exons (with, logically, one less\nintron than the number of exons).\nHow do you produce a protein from an “exonic” gene? The RNA\nphotocopy of the gene initially contains the exons and introns; an\nenzyme removes the intronic parts and splices together the exons.\nClunky, but with big implications.\nBack to each particular gene coding for a particular protein.10 Introns\nand exons destroy this simplicity. Imagine a gene consisting of exons 1,\n2, and 3, separated by introns A and B. In one part of the body a splicing\nenzyme exists that splices out the introns and also trashes exon 3,\nproducing a protein coded for by exons 1 and 2. Meanwhile, elsewhere\nin the body, a different splicing enzyme jettisons exon 2 along with the\nintrons, producing a protein derived from exons 1 and 3. In another cell\ntype a protein is made solely from exon 1. . . . Thus “alternative splicing”\ncan generate multiple unique proteins from a single stretch of DNA; so\nmuch for “one gene specifies one protein”—this gene specifies seven (A,\nB, C, A-B, A-C, B-C, and A-B-C). Remarkably, 90 percent of human\nTransposable Genetic Elements, the Stability of the\nGenome, and Neurogenesis\nTime to unmoor another cherished idea, namely that genes inherited\nfrom your parents (i.e., what you started with as a fertilized egg) are\nimmutable. This calls up a great chapter of science history. In the 1940s\nan accomplished plant geneticist named Barbara McClintock observed\nsomething impossible. She was studying the inheritance of kernel color\nin maize (a frequent tool of geneticists) and found patterns of mutations\nunexplained by any known mechanism. The only possibility, she\nconcluded, was that stretches of DNA had been copied, with the copy\nthen randomly inserted into another stretch of DNA.\nYeah, right.\nClearly McClintock, with her (derisively named) “jumping genes,”\nhad gone mad, and so she was ignored (not exactly true, but this detracts\nfrom the drama). She soldiered on in epic isolation. And finally, with the\nmolecular revolution of the 1970s, she was vindicated about her (now\ntermed) transposable genetic elements, or transposons. She was lionized,\ncanonized, Nobel Prized (and was wonderfully inspirational, as\ndisinterested in acclaim as in her ostracism, working until her nineties).\nTranspositional events rarely produce great outcomes. Consider a\nhypothetical stretch of DNA coding for “The fertilized egg is implanted\nin the uterus.”\nThere has been a transpositional event, where the underlined stretch\nof message was copied and randomly plunked down elsewhere: “The\nfertilized eggterus is implanted in the uterus.”\nGibberish.\nBut sometimes “The fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus”\nbecomes “The fertilized eggplant is implanted in the uterus.”\nNow, that’s not an everyday occurrence.\n—\nprotein.\nMammals have fewer transposons than plants. The immune system is\none transposon hot spot, in the enormous stretches of DNA coding for\nantibodies. A novel virus invades; shuffling the DNA increases the odds\nof coming up with an antibody that will target the invader.*\nThe main point here is that transposons occur in the brain.11 In\nhumans transpositional events occur in stem cells in the brain when they\nare becoming neurons, making the brain a mosaic of neurons with\ndifferent DNA sequences. In other words, when you make neurons, that\nboring DNA sequence you inherited isn’t good enough. Remarkably,\ntranspositional events occur in neurons that form memories in fruit flies.\nEven flies evolved such that their neurons are freed from the strict\ngenetic marching orders they inherit.\nChance\nFinally, chance lessens genes as the Code of Codes. Chance, driven\nby Brownian motion—the random movement of particles in a fluid—has\nbig effects on tiny things like molecules floating in cells, including\nmolecules regulating gene transcription.12 This influences how quickly\nan activated TF reaches the DNA, splicing enzymes bump into target\nstretches of RNA, and an enzyme synthesizing something grabs the two\nprecursor molecules needed for the synthesis. I’ll stop here; otherwise,\nI’ll go on for hours.\nSome Key Points, Completing This Part of the\nChapter\na. Genes are not autonomous agents commanding\nbiological events.\nb. Instead, genes are regulated by the environment, with\n“environment” consisting of everything from events\ninside the cell to the universe.\ngenes themselves.\nd. Epigenetics can allow environmental effects to be\nlifelong, or even multigenerational.\ne. And thanks to transposons, neurons contain a mosaic of\ndifferent genomes.\nBEHAVIOR GENETICS\nong before anything was known about promoters, exons, or\ntranscription factors, it became clear that you study genetics top\ndown, by observing traits shared by relatives. Early in the last century,\nthis emerged as the science of “behavior genetics.” As we’ll see, the field\nhas often been mired in controversy, typically because of disagreements\nover the magnitude of genetic effects on things like IQ or sexual\norientation.\nFirst Attempts\nThe field began with the primitive idea that, if everyone in a family\ndoes it, it must be genetic. This was confounded by environment running\nin families as well.\nThe next approach depended on closer relatives having more genes in\ncommon than distant ones. Thus, if a trait runs in a family and is more\ncommon among closer relatives, it’s genetic. But obviously, closer\nrelatives share more environment as well—think of a child and parent\nversus a child and grandparent.\nResearch grew subtler. Consider someone’s biological aunt (i.e., the\nsister of a parent), and the uncle who married the aunt. The uncle shares\nsome degree of environment with the individual, while the aunt shares\nthe same, plus genes. Therefore, the extent to which the aunt is more\nsimilar to the individual than the uncle reflects the genetic influence. But\nas we’ll see, this approach has problems.\nMore sophistication was needed.\nTwins, Adoptees, and Adopted Twins\nwell? If there are any cases where the other twin doesn’t (i.e., where the\n“concordance rate” is less than 100 percent), you’ve shown that the\ngenome and epigenetic profile inherited at birth do not solely determine\nthe incidence of schizophrenia (in fact the concordance rate is about 50\npercent).\nBut then a more elegant twin approach emerged, involving the key\ndistinction between identical (monozygotic, or MZ) twins, who share\n100 percent of their genes, and fraternal, nonidentical (dizygotic, or DZ)\ntwins, who, like all other sibling pairs, share 50 percent of their genes.\nCompare pairs of MZ twins with same-sex DZ twins. Each pair is the\nsame age, was raised in the same environment, and shared a fetal\nenvironment; the only difference is the percentage of genes shared.\nExamine a trait occurring in one member of the twin pair; is it there in\nthe other? The logic ran that, if a trait is shared more among MZ than\namong DZ twins, that increased degree of sharing reflects the genetic\ncontribution to the trait.\nAnother major advance came in the 1960s. Identify individuals\nadopted soon after birth. All they share with their biological parents is\ngenes; all they share with their adoptive parents is environment. Thus, if\nadopted individuals share a trait more with their biological than with\ntheir adoptive parents, you’ve uncovered a genetic influence. This\nreplicates a classic tool in animal studies, namely “cross-fostering”—\nswitching newborn rat pups between two mothers. The approach was\npioneered in revealing a strong genetic component to schizophrenia.13\nThen came the most wonderful, amazing, like, totally awesome thing\never in behavior genetics, started by Thomas Bouchard of the University\nof Minnesota. In 1979 Bouchard found a pair of identical twins who\nwere—get this—separated at birth and adopted into different homes,\nwith no knowledge of each other’s existence until being reunited as\nadults.14 Identical twins separated at birth are so spectacular and rare that\nbehavior geneticists swoon over them, want to collect them all. Bouchard\neventually studied more than a hundred such pairs.\nThe attraction was obvious—same genes, different environments\n(and the more different the better); thus, similarities in behavior probably\nif they do similar quirky things like, say, flushing the toilet before using\nit. Flabbergastingly, one twin pair came close to that. They were born in\n1933 in Trinidad to a German Catholic mother and a Jewish father; when\nthe boys were six months of age, the parents separated; the mother\nreturned to Germany with one son, and the other remained in Trinidad\nwith the father. The latter was raised there and in Israel as Jack Yufe, an\nobservant Jew whose first language was Yiddish. The other, Oskar Stohr,\nwas raised in Germany as a Hitler Youth zealot. Reunited and studied by\nBouchard, they warily got to know each other, discovering numerous\nshared behavioral and personality traits including . . . flushing the toilet\nbefore use. (As we’ll see, studies were more systematic than just\ndocumenting bathroom quirks. The flushing detail, however, always\ncomes up in accounts of the pair.)\nBehavior geneticists, wielding adoption and twin approaches,\ngenerated scads of studies, filling specialized journals like Genes, Brain\nand Behavior and Twin Research and Human Genetics. Collectively, the\nresearch consistently showed that genetics plays a major role in a gamut\nof domains of behavior, including IQ and its subcomponents (i.e., verbal\nability, and spatial ability),*15 schizophrenia, depression, bipolar\ndisorder, autism, attention-deficit disorder, compulsive gambling, and\nalcoholism.\nNearly as strong genetic influences were shown for personality\nmeasures related to extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness,\nneuroticism, and openness to experience (known as the “Big Five”\npersonality traits).16 Likewise with genetic influences on degree of\nreligiosity, attitude toward authority, attitude toward homosexuality,* and\npropensities toward cooperation and risk taking in games.\nOther twin studies showed genetic influences on the likelihood of\nrisky sexual behavior and on people’s degree of attraction to secondary\nsexual characteristics (e.g., musculature in men, breast size in women).17\nMeanwhile, some social scientists report genetic influences on the\nextent of political involvement and sophistication (independent of\npolitical orientation); there are behavior genetics papers in the American\nJournal of Political Science.18\nbe hot, for likelihood of voting, for feelings about dentists? Vanishingly\nunlikely. Instead, gene and behavior are often connected by tortuous\nroutes.20 Consider the genetic influence on voter participation; the\nmediating factor between the two turns out to be sense of control and\nefficacy. People who vote regularly feel that their actions matter, and this\ncentral locus of control reflects some genetically influenced personality\ntraits (e.g., high optimism, low neuroticism). Or how about the link\nbetween genes and self-confidence? Some studies show that the\nintervening variable is genetic effects on height; taller people are\nconsidered more attractive and treated better, boosting their self-\nconfidence, dammit.*\nIn other words, genetic influences on behavior often work through\nvery indirect routes, something rarely emphasized when news broadcasts\ntoss out behavior genetics sound bites—“Scientists report genetic\ninfluence on strategy when playing Candyland.”\nThe Debates About Twin and Adoption Studies\nMany scientists have heavily criticized the assumptions in twin and\nadoption studies, showing that they generally lead to overestimates of the\nimportance of genes.* Most behavior geneticists recognize these\nproblems but argue that the overestimates are tiny.21 A summary of this\ntechnical but important debate:\nCriticism #1: Twin studies are premised on MZ and same-sex DZ twin\npairs sharing environment equally (while sharing genes to very different\nextents). This “equal environment assumption” (EEA) is simply wrong;\nstarting with parents, MZ twins are treated more similarly than DZ twins,\ncreating more similar environments for them. If this isn’t recognized,\ngreater similarity between MZs will be misattributed to genes.22\nScientists such as Kenneth Kendler of Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity, a dean of the field, have tried to control for this by (a)\nquantifying just how similar childhoods were for twins (with respect to\nvariables like sharing rooms, clothing, friends, teachers, and adversity);\nthese studies show that controlling for the assumption of MZs sharing\nmore environment than do DZs doesn’t significantly reduce the size of\ngenetic influences.*23 Hold that thought.\nCriticism #2: MZ twins experience life more similarly starting as\nfetuses. DZ twins are “dichorionic,” meaning that they have separate\nplacentas. In contrast, 75 percent of MZ twins share one placenta (i.e.,\nare “monochorionic”).* Thus most MZ twin fetuses share maternal blood\nflow more than do DZ twins, and thus are exposed to more similar levels\nof maternal hormones and nutrients. If that isn’t recognized, greater\nsimilarity in MZs will be misattributed to genes.\nVarious studies have determined what the chorionic status was in\ndifferent MZ pairs and then examined end points related to cognition,\npersonality, and psychiatric disease. By a small margin, most studies\nshow that chorionic status does make a difference, leading to\noverestimates of genetic influence. How big of an overestimation? As\nstated in one review, “small but not negligible.”24\nCriticism #3: Recall that adoption studies assume that if a child is\nadopted soon after birth, she shares genes but no environment with her\nbiological parents. But what about prenatal environmental effects? A\nnewborn just spent nine months sharing the circulatory environment with\nMom. Moreover, eggs and sperm can carry epigenetic changes into the\nnext generation. If these various effects are ignored, an environmentally\nbased similarity between mother and child would be misattributed to\ngenes.\nEpigenetic transmission via sperm seems of small significance. But\nprenatal and epigenetic effects from the mother can be huge—for\nexample, the Dutch Hunger Winter phenomenon showed that third-\ntrimester malnutrition increased the risk of some adult diseases more\nthan tenfold.\nThis confound can be controlled for. Roughly half your genes come\nfrom each parent, but prenatal environment comes from Mom. Thus,\ntraits shared more with biological mothers than with fathers argue\nagainst a genetic influence.* The few tests of this, concerning the genetic\nadoption involved choosing adoptive parents randomly among everyone\non earth. Instead, adoption agencies prefer to place children with families\nof similar racial or ethnic background as the biological parents (a policy\nadvocated by the National Association of Black Social Workers and the\nChild Welfare League).* Thus, kids and adoptive parents typically share\ngenes at a higher-than-chance level; if this isn’t recognized, a similarity\nbetween them will be misattributed to environment.\nResearchers admit there is selective placement but argue over\nwhether it’s consequential. This remains unsettled. Bouchard, with his\ntwins separated at birth, controlled for cultural, material, and\ntechnological similarities between the separate homes of twin pairs,\nconcluding that shared similarity of home environments due to selective\nplacement was a negligible factor. A similar conclusion was reached in a\nlarger study carried out by both Kendler and another dean of the field,\nRobert Plomin of King’s College London.\nThese conclusions have been challenged. The most fire-breathing\ncritic has been Princeton psychologist Leon Kamin, who argues that\nconcluding that selective placement isn’t important is wrong because of\nmisinterpretation of results, use of wimpy analytical tests, and\noverreliance on questionable retrospective data. He wrote: “We suggest\nthat no scientific purpose is served by the flood of heritability estimates\ngenerated by these studies.”26\nHere’s where I give up—if super smart people who think about this\nissue all the time can’t agree, I sure don’t know how seriously selective\nplacement distorts the literature.\nCriticism #5: Adoptive parents tend to be more educated, wealthier, and\nmore psychiatrically healthy than biological parents.27 Thus, adoptive\nhouseholds show “range restriction,” being more homogeneous than\nbiological ones, which decreases the ability to detect environmental\neffects on behavior. Predictably, attempts to control for this satisfy only\nsome critics.\n—\nrestriction, and assumptions about equal environment\nare unavoidable.\nMost of these confounds inflate the perceived\nimportance of genes.\nEfforts have been made to control for these confounds\nand generally have shown that they are of less\nmagnitude than charged by many critics.\nCrucially, these studies have mostly been about\npsychiatric disorders, which, while plenty interesting,\naren’t terribly relevant to the concerns of this book. In\nother words, no one has studied whether these\nconfounds matter when considering genetic influences\non, say, people’s tendency to endorse their culture’s\nmoral rules yet rationalize why those rules don’t apply\nto them today, because they’re stressed and it’s their\nbirthday. Lots more work to be done.\nThe Fragile Nature of Heritability Estimates\nNow starts a bruising, difficult, immensely important subject. I\nreview its logic every time I teach it, because it’s so unintuitive, and I’m\nstill always just words away from getting it wrong when I open my\nmouth in class.\nBehavior genetics studies usually produce a number called a\nheritability score.28 For example, studies have reported heritability\nscores in the 40 to 60 percent range for traits related to prosocial\nbehavior, resilience after psychosocial stress, social responsiveness,\npolitical attitudes, aggression, and leadership potential.\nWhat’s a heritability score? “What does a gene do?” is at least two\nquestions. How does a gene influence average levels of a trait? How\ndoes a gene influence variation among people in levels of that trait?\nThese are crucially different. For example, how much do genes have\nto do with people’s scores averaging 100 on this thing called an IQ test?\nThese issues utilize two terms with similar sounds but different\nmeanings. If genes strongly influence average levels of a trait, that trait is\nstrongly inherited. If genes strongly influence the extent of variability\naround that average level, that trait has high heritability.* It is a\npopulation measure, where a heritability score indicates the percentage\nof total variation attributable to genetics.\nThe difference between an inherited trait and heritability generates at\nleast two problems that inflate the putative influence of genes. First,\npeople confuse the two terms (things would be easier if heritability were\ncalled something like “gene tendency”), and in a consistent direction.\nPeople often mistakenly believe that if a trait is strongly inherited, it’s\nthus highly heritable. And it’s particularly bad that confusion is typically\nin that direction, because people are usually more interested in variability\nof traits among humans than in average levels of traits. For example, it’s\nmore interesting to consider why some people are smarter than others\nthan why humans are smarter than turnips.\nThe second problem is that research consistently inflates heritability\nmeasures, leading people to conclude that genes influence individual\ndifferences more than they do.\nLet’s slowly work through this, because it’s really important.\nThe Difference Between a Trait Being Inherited\nand Having a High Degree of Heritability\nYou can appreciate the difference by considering cases where they\ndissociate.\nFirst, an example of a trait that is highly inherited but has low\nheritability, offered by the philosopher Ned Block:29 What do genes have\nto do with humans averaging five fingers per hand? Tons; it’s an\ninherited trait. What do genes have to do with variation around that\naverage? Not much—cases of other than five fingers on a hand are\nmostly due to accidents. While average finger number is an inherited\ntrait, the heritability of finger number is low—genes don’t explain\nor four fingers on his hand. Knowing whether he uses buzz saws while\nblindfolded is more useful than knowing the sequence of his genome.\nNext consider the opposite—a trait that is not highly inherited but\nwhich has high heritability. What do genes directly have to do with\nhumans being more likely than chimps to wear earrings? Not much. Now\nconsider individual differences among humans—how much do genes\nhelp predict which individuals are wearing earrings at a high school\ndance in 1958? Tons. Basically, if you had two X chromosomes, you\nprobably wore earrings, but if you had a Y chromosome, you wouldn’t\nhave been caught dead doing so. Thus, while genes had little to do with\nthe prevalence of earrings among Americans in 1958 being around 50\npercent, they had lots to do with determining which Americans wore\nthem. Thus, in that time and place, wearing earrings, while not a strongly\ninherited trait, had high heritability.\nThe Reliability of Heritability Measures\nWe’re now clear on the difference between inherited traits and their\ndegree of heritability and recognize that people are usually more\ninterested in the latter—you versus your neighbor—than the former—\nyou versus a wildebeest. As we saw, scads of behavioral and personality\ntraits have heritability scores of 40 to 60 percent, meaning that genetics\nexplains about half the variability in the trait. The point of this section is\nthat the nature of research typically inflates such scores.*30\nSay a plant geneticist sits in the desert, studying a particular species\nof plant. In this imaginary scenario a single gene, gene 3127, regulates\nthe plant’s growth. Gene 3127 comes in versions, A, B, and C. Plants\nwith version A always grow to be one inch tall; version B, two inches; C,\nthree inches.* What single fact gives you the most power in predicting a\nplant’s height? Obviously, whether it has version A, B, or C—that\nexplains all the variation in height between plants, meaning 100 percent\nheritability.\nMeanwhile, twelve thousand miles away in a rain forest, a second\nThen, as required by the plot line, the two stand side by side at a\nconference, one brandishing 1/2/3 inch data, the other 101/102/103. They\ncombine data sets. Now you want to predict the height of one example of\nthat plant, taken from anywhere on the planet. You can either know\nwhich version of gene 3127 it possesses or what environment it is\ngrowing in. Which is more useful? Knowing which environment. When\nyou study this plant species in two environments, you discover that\nheritability of height is miniscule.\nNeon lights! This is crucial: Study a gene in only one environment\nand, by definition, you’ve eliminated the ability to see if it works\ndifferently in other environments (in other words, if other environments\nregulate the gene differently). And thus you’ve artificially inflated the\nimportance of the genetic contribution. The more environments in which\nyou study a genetic trait, the more novel environmental effects will be\nrevealed, decreasing the heritability score.\nScientists study things in controlled settings to minimize variation in\nextraneous factors and thus get cleaner, more interpretable results—for\nexample, making sure that the plants all have their height measured\naround the same time of year. This inflates heritability scores, because\nyou’ve prevented yourself from ever discovering that some extraneous\nenvironmental factor isn’t actually extraneous.* Thus a heritability score\ntells how much variation in a trait is explained by genes in the\nenvironment(s) in which it’s been studied. As you study the trait in more\nenvironments, the heritability score will decrease. This is recognized by\nBouchard: “These conclusions [derived from a behavior genetics study]\ncan be generalized, of course only to new populations exposed to a range\nof environments similar to those studied.”31\nOkay, that was slick on my part, inventing a plant that grows in both\ndesert and rain forest, just to trash heritability scores. Real plants rarely\noccur in both of those environments. Instead, in one rain forest the three\ngene versions might produce plants of heights 1, 2, and 3 inches, while in\nanother they are 1.1, 2.1, and 3.1, producing a heritability score that,\nwhile less than 100 percent, is still extremely high.\nGenes typically still play hefty roles in explaining individual\nspecies that, say, lives in both tundra and desert, in various population\ndensities, in nomadic bands, sedentary farming communities, and urban\napartment buildings.\nOh, that’s right, humans. Of all species, heritability scores in humans\nplummet the most when shifting from a controlled experimental setting\nto considering the species’ full range of habitats. Just consider how much\nthe heritability score for wearing earrings, with its gender split, has\ndeclined since 1958.\n—\nNow to consider an extremely important complication.\nGene/Environment Interactions\nBack to our plant. Imagine a growth pattern in environment A of 1, 1,\nand 1 for the three gene variants, while in environment B it’s 10, 10, and\n10. When considering the combined data from both environments,\nheritability is zero—variation is entirely explained by which\nenvironment the plant grew in.\nNow, instead, in environment A it’s 1, 2, and 3, while in environment\nB it’s also 1, 2, and 3. Heritability is 100 percent, with all variability in\nheight explained by genetic variation.\nNow say environment A is 1, 2, and 3, and environment B is 1.5, 2.5,\n3.5. Heritability is somewhere between 0 percent and 100 percent.\nNow for something different: Environment A: 1, 2, 3. Environment\nB: 3, 2, 1. In this case even talking about a heritability score is\nproblematic, because different gene variants have diametrically opposite\neffects in different environments. We have an example of a central\nconcept in genetics, a gene/environment interaction, where qualitative,\nrather than just quantitative, effects of a gene differ by environment.\nHere’s a rule of thumb for recognizing gene/environment interactions,\ntranslated into English: You are studying the behavioral effects of a gene\nin two environments. Someone asks, “What are the effects of the gene on\nHere are some classic examples concerning behavior:32\nThe disease phenylketonuria arises from a single gene mutation;\nskipping over details, the mutation disables an enzyme that converts a\npotentially neurotoxic dietary constituent, phenylalanine, into something\nsafe. Thus, if you eat a normal diet, phenylalanine accumulates,\ndamaging the brain. But eat a phenylalanine-free diet from birth, and\nthere is no damage. What are the effects of this mutation on brain\ndevelopment? It depends on your diet. What’s the effect of diet on brain\ndevelopment? It depends on whether you have this (rare) mutation.\nAnother gene/environment interaction pertains to depression, a\ndisease involving serotonin abnormalities.33 A gene called 5HTT codes\nfor a transporter that removes serotonin from the synapse; having a\nparticular 5HTT variant increases the risk of depression . . . but only\nwhen coupled with childhood trauma.* What’s the effect of 5HTT\nvariant on depression risk? It depends on childhood trauma exposure.\nWhat’s the effect of childhood trauma exposure on depression risk? It\ndepends on 5HTT variant (plus loads of other genes, but you get the\npoint).\nAnother example concerns FADS2, a gene involved in fat\nmetabolism.34 One variant is associated with higher IQ, but only in\nbreast-fed children. Same pair of “what’s the effect” questions, same “it\ndepends” answers.\nOne final gene/environment interaction was revealed in an important\n1999 Science paper. The study was a collaboration among three\nbehavioral geneticists—one at Oregon Health Sciences University, one at\nthe University of Alberta, and one at the State University of New York in\nAlbany.35 They studied mouse strains known to have genetic variants\nrelevant to particular behaviors (e.g., addiction or anxiety). First they\nensured that the mice from a particular strain were essentially genetically\nidentical in all three labs. Then the scientists did cartwheels to test the\nanimals in identical conditions in the labs.\nThey standardized everything. Because some mice were born in the\nlab but others came from breeders, homegrowns were given bouncy van\nrides to simulate the jostling that commercially bred mice undergo\nsame day of the week. They were handled the same number of times by\nhumans wearing the same brand of surgical gloves. They were fed the\nsame food and kept in the same lighting environment at the same\ntemperature. The environments of these animals could hardly have been\nmore similar if the three scientists had been identical triplets separated at\nbirth.\nWhat did they observe? Some gene variants showed massive\ngene/environment interactions, with variants having radically different\neffects in different labs.\nHere’s the sort of data they got: Take a strain called 129/SvEvTac\nand a test measuring the effects of cocaine on activity. In Oregon cocaine\nincreased activity in these mice by 667 centimeters of movement per\nfifteen minutes. In Albany, an increase of 701. Those are pretty similar\nnumbers; good. And in Alberta? More than 5,000. That’s like identical\ntriplets pole-vaulting, each in a different location; they’ve all had the\nsame training, equipment, running surface, night’s rest, breakfast, and\nbrand of underwear. The first two vault 18 feet and 18 feet one inch, and\nthe third vaults 108 feet.\nMaybe the scientists didn’t know what they were doing; maybe the\nlabs were chaotic. But variability was small within each lab, showing\nstable environmental conditions. And crucially, a few variants didn’t\nshow a gene/environment interaction, producing similar effects in the\nthree labs.\nWhat does this mean? That most of the gene variants were so\nsensitive to environment that gene/environment interactions occurred\neven in these obsessively similar lab settings, where incredibly subtle\n(and still unidentified) environmental differences made huge differences\nin what the gene did.\nCiting “gene/environment interactions” is a time-honored genetics\ncliché.36 My students roll their eyes when I mention them. I roll my eyes\nwhen I mention them. Eat your vegetables, floss your teeth, remember to\nsay, “It’s difficult to quantitatively assess the relative contributions of\ngenes and environment to a particular trait when they interact.” This\nsuggests a radical conclusion: it’s not meaningful to ask what a gene\ninfluenced by its length than its width.” It’s appropriate to figure out if\nlengths or widths explain more of the variability in a population of\nrectangles. But not in individual ones.\n—\nAs we conclude part 2 of this chapter, some key points:\na. A gene’s influence on the average value of a trait (i.e.,\nwhether it is inherited) differs from its influence on\nvariability of that trait across individuals (its\nheritability).\nb. Even in the realm of inherited traits—say, the\ninheritance of five fingers as the human average—you\ncan’t really say that there is genetic determination in the\nclassically hard-assed sense of the word. This is because\nthe inheritance of a gene’s effect requires not just\npassing on the gene but also the context that regulates\nthe gene in that manner.\nc. Heritability scores are relevant only to the environments\nin which the traits have been studied. The more\nenvironments you study a trait in, the lower the\nheritability is likely to be.\nd. Gene/environment interactions are ubiquitous and can\nbe dramatic. Thus, you can’t really say what a gene\n“does,” only what it does in the environments in which\nit’s been studied.\nCurrent research actively explores gene/environment interactions.37\nHow’s this for fascinating: Heritability of various aspects of cognitive\ndevelopment is very high (e.g., around 70 percent for IQ) in kids from\nhigh–socioeconomic status (SES) families but is only around 10 percent\nin low-SES kids. Thus, higher SES allows the full range of genetic\ninfluences on cognition to flourish, whereas lower-SES settings restrict\nthem. In other words, genes are nearly irrelevant to cognitive\n249\namong religious than nonreligious subjects—i.e., your genes don’t\nmatter much if you’re in a religious environment that condemns\ndrinking. Domains like these showcase the potential power of classical\nbehavior genetics.\n\nBEHAVIORS WE’RE INTERESTED IN?\nThe Marriage of Behavior Genetics and Molecular\nGenetics\nBehavior genetics has gotten a huge boost by incorporating\nmolecular approaches—after examining similarities and differences\nbetween twins or adoptees, find the actual genes that underlie those\nsimilarities and differences. This powerful approach has identified\nvarious genes relevant to our interests. But first, our usual caveats: (a)\nnot all of these findings consistently replicate; (b) effect sizes are\ntypically small (in other words, some gene may be involved, but not in a\nmajor way); and (c) the most interesting findings show\ngene/environment interactions.\nStudying Candidate Genes\nGene searches can take a “candidate” approach or a genomewide\nassociation approach (stay tuned). The former requires a list of plausible\nsuspects—genes already known to be related to some behavior. For\nexample, if you’re interested in a behavior that involves serotonin,\nobvious candidate genes would include those coding for enzymes that\nmake or degrade serotonin, pumps that remove it from the synapse, or\nserotonin receptors. Pick one that interests you, and study it in animals\nusing molecular tools to generate “knockout” mice (where you’ve\neliminated that gene) or “transgenic” mice (with an extra copy of the\ngene). Make manipulations like these only in certain brain regions or at\ncertain times. Then examine what’s different about behavior. Once\nyou’re convinced of an effect, ask whether variants of that gene help\nexplain individual differences in human versions of the behavior. I start\nworst behaviors? Plenty.\nChapter 2 presented a fairly clear picture of low levels of serotonin\nfostering impulsive antisocial behavior. There are lower-than-average\nlevels of serotonin breakdown products in the bloodstreams of people\nwith that profile, and of serotonin itself in the frontal cortex of such\nanimals. Even more convincingly, drugs that decrease “serotonergic\ntone” (i.e., decreasing serotonin levels or sensitivity to serotonin)\nincrease impulsive aggression; raising the tone does the opposite.\nThis generates some simple predictions—all of the following should\nbe associated with impulsive aggression, as they will produce low\nserotonin signaling:\na. Low-activity variants of the gene for tryptophan\nhydroxylase (TH), which makes serotonin\nb. High-activity variants of the gene for monoamine\noxidase-A (MAO-A), which degrades serotonin\nc. High-activity variants of the gene for the serotonin\ntransporter (5HTT), which removes serotonin from the\nsynapse\nd. Variants of genes for serotonin receptors that are less\nsensitive to serotonin\nAn extensive literature shows that for each of those genes the results\nare inconsistent and generally go in the opposite direction from “low\nserotonin = aggression” dogma. Ugh.\nStudies of genes for TH and serotonin receptors are inconsistent\nmesses.38 In contrast, the picture of 5HTT, the serotonin transporter\ngene, is consistently in the opposite direction from what’s expected. Two\nvariants exist, with one producing less transporter protein, meaning less\nserotonin removed from the synapse.* And counter to expectations, this\nvariant, producing more serotonin in the synapse, is associated with more\nimpulsive aggression, not less. Thus, according to these findings, “high\nserotonin = aggression” (recognizing this as simplified shorthand).\nsynapse. And counter to chapter 2’s predictions, the family was\ncharacterized by varied antisocial and aggressive behaviors.\nMouse studies in which the MAO-A gene was “knocked out”\n(producing the equivalent of the Dutch family’s mutation) produced the\nsame—elevated serotonin levels in the synapse and hyperaggressive\nanimals with enhanced fear responses.40\nThis finding, of course, concerned a mutation in MAO-A resulting in\nthe complete absence of the protein. Research soon focused on low-\nactivity MAO-A variants that produced elevated serotonin levels.*41\nPeople with that variant averaged higher levels of aggression and\nimpulsivity and, when looking at angry or fearful faces, more activation\nof the amygdala and insula and less activation of the prefrontal cortex.\nThis suggests a scenario of more fear reactivity and less frontal capacity\nto restrain such fear, a perfect storm for reactive aggression. Related\nstudies showed decreased activation of frontal cortical regions during\nvarious attentional tasks and enhanced anterior cingulate activity in\nresponse to social rejection in such individuals.\nSo studies where serotonin breakdown products are measured in the\nbody, or where serotonin levels are manipulated with drugs, say that low\nserotonin = aggression.42 And the genetic studies, particularly of MAO-\nA, say high serotonin = aggression. What explains this discrepancy? The\nkey probably is that a drug manipulation lasts for a few hours or days,\nwhile genetic variants have their effects on serotonin for a lifetime.\nPossible explanations: (a) The low-activity MAO-A variants don’t\nproduce higher synaptic levels of serotonin all that consistently because\nthe 5HTT serotonin reuptake pump works harder at removing serotonin\nfrom the synapse, compensating, and maybe even overcompensating.\nThere is evidence for this, just to make life really complicated. (b) Those\nvariants do produce chronically elevated serotonin levels in the synapse,\nbut the postsynaptic neurons compensate or overcompensate by\ndecreasing serotonin receptor numbers, thereby reducing sensitivity to all\nthat serotonin; there is evidence for that too. (c) The lifelong\nconsequences of differences in serotonin signaling due to gene variants\n(versus transient differences due to drugs) produce structural changes in\nYikes, this is complicated. Why go through the agony of all these\nexplanatory twists and turns? Because this obscure corner of\nneurogenetics has caught the public’s fancy, with—I kid you not—the\nlow-activity MAO-A variant being referred to as the “warrior gene” by\nboth scientists and in the media.*43 And that warrior hoo-hah is\nworsened by the MAO-A gene being X linked and its variants being\nmore consequential in males than females. Amazingly, prison sentences\nfor murderers have now been lessened in at least two cases because it\nwas argued that the criminal, having the “warrior gene” variant of MAO-\nA, was inevitably fated to be uncontrollably violent. OMG.\nResponsible people in the field have recoiled in horror at this sort of\nunfounded genetic determinism seeping into the courtroom. The effects\nof MAO-A variants are tiny. There is nonspecificity in the sense that\nMAO-A degrades not only serotonin but norepinephrine as well. Most of\nall, there is nonspecificity in the behavioral effects of the variants. For\nexample, while nearly everyone seems to remember that the landmark\nMAO-A paper that started all the excitement was about aggression (one\nauthoritative review referred to the Dutch family with the mutation as\n“notorious for the persistent and extreme reactive aggression\ndemonstrated by some of its males”), in actuality members of the family\nwith the mutation had borderline mental retardation. Moreover, while\nsome individuals with the mutation were quite violent, the antisocial\nbehavior of others consisted of arson and exhibitionism. So maybe the\ngene has something to do with the extreme reactive aggression of some\nfamily members. But it is just as responsible for explaining why other\nfamily members, rather than being aggressive, were flashers. In other\nwords, there is as much rationale for going on about the “drop your pants\ngene” as the “warrior gene.”\nProbably the biggest reason to reject warrior-gene determinism\nnonsense is something that should be utterly predictable by now: MAO-\nA effects on behavior show strong gene/environment interactions.\nThis brings us to a hugely important 2002 study, one of my favorites,\nby Avshalom Caspi and colleagues at Duke University.44 The authors\nfollowed a large cohort of children from birth to age twenty-six, studying\npowerfully did. Having the low-activity version of MAO-A tripled the\nlikelihood . . . but only in people with a history of severe childhood\nabuse. And if there was no such history, the variant was not predictive of\nanything. This is the essence of gene/environment interaction. What does\nhaving a particular variant of the MAO-A gene have to do with antisocial\nbehavior? It depends on the environment. “Warrior gene” my ass.\nThis study is important not just for its demonstration of a powerful\ngene/environment interaction but for what the interaction is, namely the\nability of an abusive childhood environment to collaborate with a\nparticular genetic constitution. To quote a major review on the subject,\n“In a healthy environment, increased threat sensitivity, poor emotion\ncontrol and enhanced fear memory in MAOA-L [i.e., the “warrior”\nvariant] men might only manifest as variation in temperament within a\n‘normal’ or subclinical range. However, these same characteristics in an\nabusive childhood environment—one typified by persistent uncertainty,\nunpredictable threat, poor behavioral modeling and social referencing,\nand inconsistent reinforcement for prosocial decision making—might\npredispose toward frank aggression and impulsive violence in the adult.”\nIn a similar vein, the low-activity variant of the serotonin transporter\ngene was reported to be associated with adult aggressiveness . . . but only\nwhen coupled with childhood adversity.45 This is straight out of the\nlessons of the previous chapter.\nSince then, this MAO-A variant/childhood abuse interaction has been\nfrequently replicated, and even demonstrated with respect to aggressive\nbehavior in rhesus monkeys.46 There have also been hints as to how this\ninteraction works—the MAO-A gene promoter is regulated by stress and\nglucocorticoids.\nMAO-A variants show other important gene/environment\ninteractions. For example, in one study the low-activity MAO-A variant\npredicts criminality, but only if coupled with high testosterone levels\n(consistent with that, the MAO-A gene also has a promoter responsive to\nandrogens). In another study low-activity MAO-A participants in an\neconomic game were more likely than high-activity ones to retaliate\naggressively when exploited by the other player—but only if that\nconsidering other, nongenetic factors in individuals’ lives, such as\nchildhood adversity and adult provocation.47\nThe Dopamine System\nChapter 2 introduced the role of dopamine in the anticipation of\nreward and in goal-directed behavior. Lots of work has examined the\ngenes involved, most broadly showing that variants that produce lowered\ndopamine signaling (less dopamine in the synapse, fewer dopamine\nreceptors, or lower responsiveness of these receptors) are associated with\nsensation seeking, risk taking, attentional problems, and extroversion.\nSuch individuals have to seek experiences of greater intensity to\ncompensate for the blunted dopamine signaling.\nMuch of the research has focused on one particular dopamine\nreceptor; there are at least five kinds (found in different parts of the\nbrain, binding dopamine with differing strengths and duration), each\ncoded for by a gene.48 Work has focused on the gene for the D4\ndopamine receptor (the gene is called DRD4), which mostly occurs in\nthe neurons in the cortex and nucleus accumbens. The DRD4 gene is\nsuper variable, coming in at least ten different flavors in humans. One\nstretch of the gene is repeated a variable number of times, and the\nversion with seven repeats (the “7R” form) produces a receptor protein\nthat is sparse in the cortex and relatively unresponsive to dopamine. This\nis the variant associated with a host of related traits—sensation and\nnovelty seeking, extroversion, alcoholism, promiscuity, less sensitive\nparenting, financial risk taking, impulsivity, and, probably most\nconsistently, ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).\nThe implications cut both ways—the 7R could make you more likely\nto impulsively steal the old lady’s kidney dialysis machine, or to\nimpulsively give the deed of your house to a homeless family. In come\ngene/environment interactions. For example, kids with the 7R variant are\nless generous than average. But only if they show insecure attachment to\ntheir parents. Secure-attachment 7Rs show more generosity than average.\nOne more—7Rs are worse at gratification-postponement tasks, but only\nif they grew up poor. Repeat the mantra: don’t ask what a gene does; ask\nwhat it does in a particular context.49\nInterestingly, the next chapter considers the extremely varied\nfrequency of the 7R variant in different populations. As we’ll see, it tells\nyou a lot about the history of human migration, as well as about\ndifferences between collectivist and individualist cultures.50\nWe shift now to other parts of the dopamine system. As introduced in\nchapter 2, after dopamine binds to receptors, it floats off and must be\nremoved from the synapse.51 One route involves its being degraded by\nthe enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Among the variants\nof the COMT gene is one associated with a more efficient enzyme.\n“More efficient” = better at degrading dopamine = less dopamine in the\nsynapse = less dopamine signaling. The highly efficient COMT variant is\nassociated with higher rates of extroversion, aggression, criminality, and\nconduct disorder. Moreover, in a gene/environment interaction straight\nout of the MAO-A playbook, that COMT variant is associated with anger\ntraits, but only when coupled with childhood sexual abuse. Intriguingly,\nthe variants seem pertinent to frontal regulation of behavior and\ncognition, especially during stress.\nIn addition to degradation, neurotransmitters can be removed from\nthe synapse by being taken back up into the axon terminal for\nrecycling.52 Dopamine reuptake is accomplished by the dopamine\ntransporter (DAT). Naturally, the DAT gene comes in different variants,\nand those that produce higher levels of synaptic dopamine (i.e.,\ntransporter variants that are less efficient) in the striatum are associated\nwith people who are more oriented toward social signaling—they’re\ndrawn more than average to happy faces, are more repelled by angry\nfaces, and have more positive parenting styles. How these findings\nmerge with the findings from the DRD4 and COMT studies (i.e., fitting\nrisk taking with a preference for happy faces) is not immediately\napparent.\nCool people with certain versions of these dopamine-related genes\nAgain, why should the COMT world be related to\nsensation seeking, while there are the DAT people and\ntheir happy faces? Both genes are about ending\ndopamine signaling. This is probably related to different\nparts of the brain differing as to whether DAT or COMT\nplays a bigger role.53\nThe COMT literature is majorly messy, for the\ninconvenient reason that the enzyme also degrades\nnorepinephrine. So COMT variants are pertinent to two\ntotally different neurotransmitter systems.\nThese effects are tiny. For example, knowing which\nDRD4 variant someone has explains only 3 to 4 percent\nof the variation in novelty-seeking behavior.\nThe final piece of confusion seems most important but is\nleast considered in the literature (probably because it\nwould be premature). Suppose that every study shows\nwith whopping clarity and consistency that a DRD4\nvariant is highly predictive of novelty seeking. That still\ndoesn’t tell us why for some people novelty seeking\nmeans frequently switching their openings in chess\ngames, while for others it means looking for a new\nlocale because it’s getting stale being a mercenary in the\nCongo. No gene or handful of genes that we are aware\nof will tell us much about that.\nThe Neuropeptides Oxytocin and Vasopressin\nTime for a quick recap from chapter 4. Oxytocin and vasopressin are\ninvolved in prosociality, ranging from parent/offspring bonds to\nmonogamous bonds to trust, empathy, generosity, and social intelligence.\nRecall the caveats: (a) sometimes these neuropeptides are more about\nsociality than prosociality (in other words, boosting social information\ngathering, rather than acting prosocially with that information); (b) they\nmost consistently boost prosociality in people who already lean in that\nChapter 4 also touched on oxytocin and vasopressin genetics,\nshowing that individuals with genetic variants that result in higher levels\nof either the hormones or their receptors tend toward more stable\nmonogamous relationships, more actively engaged parenting, better skill\nat perspective taking, more empathy, and stronger fusiform cortex\nresponses to faces. These are fairly consistent effects of moderate\nmagnitude.\nMeanwhile, there are studies showing that one oxytocin receptor\ngene variant is associated with extreme aggression in kids, as well as a\ncallous, unemotional style that foreshadows adult psychopathy.54\nMoreover, another variant is associated with social disconnection in kids\nand unstable adult relationships. But unfortunately these findings are\nuninterpretable because no one knows if these variants produce more,\nless, or the usual amount of oxytocin signaling.\nOf course, there are cool gene/environment interactions. For\nexample, having a particular oxytocin receptor gene variant predicts less\nsensitive mothering—but only when coupled with childhood adversity.\nAnother variant is associated with aggression—but only when people\nhave been drinking. Yet another variant is associated with greater\nseeking of emotional support during times of stress—among Americans\n(including first generation Korean Americans) but not Koreans (stay\ntuned for more in the next chapter).\nGenes Related to Steroid Hormones\nWe start with testosterone. The hormone is not a protein (none of the\nsteroid hormones are), meaning there isn’t a testosterone gene. However,\nthere are genes for the enzymes that construct testosterone, for the\nenzyme that converts it to estrogen, and for the testosterone (androgen)\nreceptor. The most work has focused on the gene for the receptor, which\ncomes in variants that differ in their responsiveness to testosterone.*\nIntriguingly, a few studies have shown that among criminals, having\nthe more potent variant is associated with violent crimes.55 A related\npredict elevated levels of aggressive mood or of amygdaloid reactivity to\nthreatening faces in males—except in those with that variant.\nInterestingly, the equivalent variant predicts aggressiveness in Akita\ndogs.\nHow important are these findings? A key theme in chapter 4 was\nhow little individual differences in testosterone levels in the normal\nrange predict individual differences in behavior. How much more\npredictability is there when combining knowledge of testosterone levels\nand of receptor sensitivity? Not much. How about hormone levels and\nreceptor sensitivity and number of receptors? Still not much. But\ndefinitely an improvement in predictive power.\nSimilar themes concern the genetics of the estrogen receptor.56 For\nexample, different receptor variants are associated with higher rates of\nanxiety among women, but not men, and higher rates of antisocial\nbehavior and conduct disorder in men, but not women. Meanwhile, in\ngenetically manipulated mice, the presence or absence of the receptor\ngene influences aggression in females . . . depending on how many\nbrothers there were in the litter in utero—gene/environment again. Once\nagain, the magnitude of these genetic influences is tiny.\nFinally, there is work on genes related to glucocorticoids, particularly\nregarding gene/environment interactions.57 For example, there is an\ninteraction between one variant of the gene for a type of receptor for\nglucocorticoids (for mavens: it’s the MR receptor) and childhood abuse\nin producing an amygdala that is hyperreactive to threat. Then there is a\nprotein called FKBP5, which modifies the activity of another type of\nreceptor for glucocorticoids (the GR receptor); one FKBP5 variant is\nassociated with aggression, hostility, PTSD, and hyperreactivity of the\namygdala to threat—but only when coupled with childhood abuse.\nBuoyed by these findings, some researchers have examined two\ncandidate genes simultaneously. For example, having both “risk”\nvariants of 5HTT and DRD4 synergistically increases the risk of\ndisruptive behavior in kids—an effect exacerbated by low\nsocioeconomic status.58\nPhew; all these pages and we’ve only gotten to thinking about two\nThe usual—effect sizes are small. Knowing what variant\nof a candidate gene someone has (or even what variants\nof a collection of genes) doesn’t help much in predicting\ntheir behavior.\nA major reason is that, after getting a handle on 5HTT\nand DRD4 interactions, there are still roughly 19,998\nmore human genes and a gazillion more environments to\nstudy. Time to switch to the other main approach—\nlooking at all those 20,000 genes at once.\nFishing Expeditions, Instead of Looking Where\nthe Light Is\nThe small effect sizes reflect a limitation in the candidate gene\napproach; in scientific lingo, the problem is that one is only looking\nwhere the light is. The cliché harks back to a joke: You discover\nsomeone at night, searching the ground under a street lamp. “What’s\nwrong?” “I dropped my ring; I’m looking for it.” Trying to be helpful,\nyou ask, “Were you standing on this side or that side of the lamp when\nyou dropped it?” “Oh, no, I was over by those trees when I dropped it.”\n“Then why are you searching here?” “This is where the light is.” With\ncandidate gene approaches, you look only where the light is, examine\nonly genes that you already know are involved. And with twenty\nthousand or so genes, it’s pretty safe to assume there are still some\ninteresting genes that you don’t know about yet. The challenge is to find\nthem.\nThe most common way of trying to find them all is with genomewide\nassociation studies (GWAS).59 Examine, say, the gene for hemoglobin\nand look at the eleventh nucleotide in the sequence; everyone will pretty\nmuch have the same DNA letter in that spot. However, there are little hot\nspots of variability, single nucleotides where, say, two different DNA\nletters occur, each in about 50 percent of the population (and where this\ntypically doesn’t change the amino acid being specified, because of\nparticular SNPs associate with particular traits. If an SNP that’s\nimplicated occurs in a gene, you’ve just gotten a hint that the gene may\nbe involved in that trait.*\nA GWAS study might implicate scads of genes as being associated\nwith a trait. Hopefully, some will be candidate genes already known to\nbe related to the trait. But other identified genes may be mysterious. Now\ngo check out what they do.\nIn a related approach, suppose you have two populations, one with\nand one without a degenerative muscle disease. Take a muscle biopsy\nfrom everyone, and see which of the ~20,000 genes are transcriptionally\nactive in the muscle cells. With this “microarray” or “gene chip”\napproach, you look for genes that are transcriptionally active only in\ndiseased or in healthy muscle, not in both. Identify them, and you have\nsome new candidate genes to explore.*\nThese fishing expeditions* show why we’re so ignorant about the\ngenetics of behavior.60 Consider a classic GWAS that looked for genes\nrelated to height. This was a crazy difficult study involving examining\nthe genomes of 183,727 people. 183,727. It must have taken an army of\nscientists just to label the test tubes. And reflecting that, the paper\nreporting the findings in Nature had approximately 280 authors.\nAnd the results? Hundreds of genetic variants were implicated in\nregulating height. A handful of genes identified were known to be\ninvolved in skeletal growth, but the rest was terra incognita. The single\ngenetic variant identified that most powerfully predicted height\nexplained all of 0.4 percent—four tenths of one percent—of the variation\nin height, and all those hundreds of variants put together explained only\nabout 10 percent of the variation.\nMeanwhile, an equally acclaimed study did a GWAS regarding body\nmass index (BMI). Similar amazingness—almost a quarter million\ngenomes examined, even more authors than the height study. And in this\ncase the single most explanatory genetic variant identified accounted for\nonly 0.3 percent of the variation in BMI. Thus both height and BMI are\nhighly “polygenic” traits. Same for age of menarche (when girls\nWhat about behavior? A superb 2013 GWAS study examined the\ngenetic variants associated with educational attainment.62 The usual\nover-the-top numbers—126,559 study subjects, about 180 authors. And\nthe most predictive genetic variant accounted for 0.02 percent—two\nhundredths of one percent—of the variation. All the identified variants\ntogether accounted for about 2 percent of the variation. A commentary\naccompanying the paper contained this landmark of understatement: “In\nshort, educational attainment looks to be a very polygenic trait.”\nEducational attainment—how many years of high school or college\none completes—is relatively easy to measure. How about the subtler,\nmessier behaviors that fill this book’s pages? A handful of studies have\ntackled that, and the findings are much the same—at the end, you have a\nlist of scores of genes implicated and can then go figure out what they do\n(logically, starting with the ones that showed the strongest statistical\nassociations). Hard, hard approaches that are still in their infancy. Made\nworse by a GWAS missing more subtly variable spots,* meaning even\nmore genes are likely involved.63\n—\nAs we conclude this section, some key points:64\na. This review of candidate genes barely scratches even the\nsurface of the surface. Go on PubMed (a major search\nengine of the biomedical literature) and search “MAO\ngene/behavior”—up come more than 500 research\npapers. “Serotonin transporter gene/behavior”—1,250\npapers. “Dopamine receptor gene/behavior”—nearly\n2,000.\nb. The candidate gene approaches show that the effect of a\nsingle gene on a behavior is typically tiny. In other\nwords, having the “warrior gene” variant of MAO\nprobably has less effect on your behavior than does\nbelieving that you have it.\nc. Genomewide survey approaches show that these\nrisk of depression, but also anxiety, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,\nTourette’s syndrome, and borderline personality\ndisorder. In other words, that gene is part of a network\nof hundreds of genes pertinent to depression, but also\npart of another equally large and partially overlapping\nnetwork relevant to anxiety, another relevant to OCD,\nand so on. And meanwhile, we’re plugging away, trying\nto understand interactions of two genes at a time.\nt long last, you (and I!) have gotten to the end of this\nexcruciatingly but necessarily long chapter. Amid all these tiny\neffects and technical limitations, it’s important to not throw out the\ngenetic baby with the bathwater, as has been an agitated sociopolitical\ngoal at times (during my intellectual youth in the 1970s, sandwiched\nbetween the geologic periods of Cranberry Bell-bottoms and of John\nTravolta White Suits was the Genes-Have-Nothing-to-Do-with-Behavior\nIce Age).\nGenes have plenty to do with behavior. Even more appropriately, all\nbehavioral traits are affected to some degree by genetic variability.65\nThey have to be, given that they specify the structure of all the proteins\npertinent to every neurotransmitter, hormone, receptor, etc. that there is.\nAnd they have plenty to do with individual differences in behavior, given\nthe large percentage of genes that are polymorphic, coming in different\nflavors. But their effects are supremely context dependent. Ask not what\na gene does. Ask what it does in a particular environment and when\nexpressed in a particular network of other genes (i.e.,\ngene/gene/gene/gene . . . /environment).\nThus, for our purposes, genes aren’t about inevitability. Instead\nthey’re about context-dependent tendencies, propensities, potentials, and\nvulnerabilities. All embedded in the fabric of the other factors, biological\nand otherwise, that fill these pages."

    "content": "Centuries to Millennia\nBefore\net’s start with a seeming digression. Parts of chapters 4 and 7 have\ndebunked some supposed sex differences concerning the brain,\nhormones, and behavior. One difference, however, is persistent. It’s far\nfrom issues that concern this book, but bear with me.\nA remarkably consistent finding, starting with elementary school\nstudents, is that males are better at math than females. While the\ndifference is minor when it comes to considering average scores, there is\na huge difference when it comes to math stars at the upper extreme of the\ndistribution. For example, in 1983, for every girl scoring in the highest\npercentile on the math SAT, there were eleven boys.\nWhy the difference? There have always been suggestions that\ntestosterone is central. During development, testosterone fuels the\ngrowth of a brain region involved in mathematical thinking, and giving\nadults testosterone enhances some math skills. Oh, okay, it’s biological.\nBut consider a paper published in Science in 2008.1 The authors\nexamined the relationship between math scores and sexual equality in\nforty countries (based on economic, educational, and political indices of\ngender equality; the worst was Turkey, the United States was middling,\nand, naturally, the Scandinavians were tops). Lo and behold, the more\ngender equal the country, the less of a discrepancy in math scores. By the\ntime you get to the Scandinavian countries, it’s statistically insignificant.\nIn other words, while you can never be certain, the Afghan girl\npictured on top, on the next page, seated next to her husband, is less\nlikely than the Swedish girl pictured below her to solve the Erdös-Hajnal\nconjecture in graph theory.\nIn other, other words, culture matters. We carry it with us wherever\nwe go. As one example, the level of corruption—a government’s lack of\ntransparency regarding use of power and finances—in UN diplomats’\nhome countries predicts their likelihood of racking up unpaid parking\ntickets in Manhattan. Culture leaves long-lasting residues—Shiites and\nSunnis slaughter each other over a succession issue fourteen centuries\nold; across thirty-three countries population density in the year 1500\nsignificantly predicts how authoritarian the government was in 2000;\n267\nAnd in other, other, other words, when we contemplate our iconic\nacts—the pulling of a trigger, the touching of an arm—and want to\nexplain why they happened using a biological framework, culture better\nbe on our list of explanatory factors.\nThus, the goals of this chapter:\nLook at systematic patterns of cultural variation as they\npertain to the best and worst of our behaviors.\n\n268\nExplore how different types of brains produce different\nculture and different types of culture produce different\nbrains. In other words, how culture and biology\ncoevolve.3\nSee the role of ecology in shaping culture.\n\nDIFFERENCES\nulture,” naturally, has been defined various ways. One\ninfluential definition comes from Edward Tylor, a distinguished\nnineteenth-century cultural anthropologist. For him culture is “that\ncomplex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law,\ncustom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man [sic] as a\nmember of society.”4\nThis definition, obviously, is oriented toward something that is\nspecific to humans. Jane Goodall blew off everyone’s socks in the 1960s\nby reporting the now-iconic fact that chimps make tools. Her study\nsubjects modified twigs by stripping off the leaves and pushing them into\ntermite mounds; termites would bite the twig, still holding on when it\nwas pulled out, yielding a snack for the chimps.\nThis was just the start. Chimps were subsequently found to use\nvarious tools—wood or rock anvils for cracking open nuts, wads of\nchewed leaves to sponge up hard-to-reach water, and, in a real shocker,\nsharpened sticks for spearing bush babies.5 Different populations make\ndifferent tools; new techniques spread across social networks (among\nchimps who hang with one another); kids learn the ropes by watching\ntheir moms; techniques spread from one group to another when someone\nemigrates; chimp nut-cracking tools in excess of four thousand years old\nhave been excavated. And in my favorite example, floating between tool\nuse and accessorizing, a female in Zambia got it into her head to go\naround with a strawlike blade of grass in her ear. The action had no\nobvious function; apparently she just liked having a piece of grass\nsticking out of her ear. So sue her. She did it for years, and over that time\nthe practice spread throughout her group. A fashionista.\nIn the decades since Goodall’s discovery, tool use has been observed\nin apes and monkeys, elephants, sea otters, mongoose.6 Dolphins use sea\nE. van Leeuwen et al., “A Group-Specific Arbitrary Tradition in Chimpanzees\n(Pan troglodytes),” Animal Cog 17 (2014): 1421.\nAll this is mighty impressive. Nonetheless, such cultural\ntransmission doesn’t show progression—this year’s chimp nut-cracking\ntool is pretty much the same as that of four thousand years ago. And with\nfew exceptions (more later), nonhuman culture is solely about material\nculture (versus, say, social organization).\nthat cut chimps and other hoi polloi out of the party. There’s a fondness\nfor the thinking of Alfred Kroeber, Clyde Kluckhohn, and Clifford\nGeertz, three heavyweight social anthropologists who focused on how\nculture is about ideas and symbols, rather than the mere behaviors in\nwhich they instantiate, or material products like flint blades or iPhones.\nContemporary anthropologists like Richard Shweder have emphasized a\nmore affective but still human-centric view of culture as being about\nmoral and visceral versions of right and wrong. And of course these\nviews have been critiqued by postmodernists for reasons I can’t begin to\nfollow.\nBasically, I don’t want to go anywhere near these debates. For our\npurposes we’ll rely on an intuitive definition of culture that has been\nemphasized by Frans de Waal: “culture” is how we do and think about\nthings, transmitted by nongenetic means.\nWorking with that broad definition, is the most striking thing about\nthe array of human cultures the similarities or the differences? Depends\non your taste.\nIf the similarities seem most interesting, there are plenty—after all,\nmultiple groups of humans independently invented agriculture, writing,\npottery, embalming, astronomy, and coinage. At the extreme of\nsimilarities are human universals, and numerous scholars have proposed\nlists of them. One of the lengthiest and most cited comes from the\nanthropologist Donald Brown.8 Here’s a partial list of his proposed\ncultural universals: the existence of and concern with aesthetics, magic,\nmales and females seen as having different natures, baby talk, gods,\ninduction of altered states, marriage, body adornment, murder,\nprohibition of some type of murder, kinship terms, numbers, cooking,\nprivate sex, names, dance, play, distinctions between right and wrong,\nnepotism, prohibitions on certain types of sex, empathy, reciprocity,\nrituals, concepts of fairness, myths about afterlife, music, color terms,\nprohibitions, gossip, binary sex terms, in-group favoritism, language,\nhumor, lying, symbolism, the linguistic concept of “and,” tools, trade,\nand toilet training. And that’s a partial list.\nFor the purposes of this chapter, the staggeringly large cultural\nexpectancy; one in Angola, thirty-nine. Latvia has 99.9 percent literacy;\nNiger, 19 percent. More than 10 percent of children in Afghanistan die in\ntheir first year, about 0.2 percent in Iceland. Per-capita GDP is $137,000\nin Qatar, $609 in the Central African Republic. A woman in South Sudan\nis roughly a thousand times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman\nin Estonia.9\nThe experience of violence also varies enormously by culture.\nSomeone in Honduras is 450 times more likely to be murdered than\nsomeone in Singapore. 65 percent of women experience intimate-partner\nviolence in Central Africa, 16 percent in East Asia. A South African\nwoman is more than one hundred times more likely to be raped than one\nin Japan. Be a school kid in Romania, Bulgaria, or Ukraine, and you’re\nabout ten times more likely to be chronically bullied than a kid in\nSweden, Iceland, or Denmark (stay tuned for a closer look at this).10\nOf course, there are the well-known gender-related cultural\ndifferences. There are the Scandinavian countries approaching total\ngender equality and Rwanda, with 63 percent of its lower-house\nparliamentary seats filled by women, compared with Saudi Arabia,\nwhere women are not allowed outside the house unless accompanied by\na male guardian, and Yemen, Qatar, and Tonga, with 0 percent female\nlegislators (and with the United States running around 20 percent).11\nThen there’s the Philippines, where 93 percent of people say they feel\nhappy and loved, versus 29 percent of Armenians. In economic games,\npeople in Greece and Oman are more likely to spend resources to punish\noverly generous players than to punish those who are cheaters, whereas\namong Australians such “antisocial punishment” is nonexistent. And\nthere are wildly different criteria for prosocial behavior. In a study of\nemployees throughout the world working for the same multinational\nbank, what was the most important reason cited to help someone?\nAmong Americans it was that the person had previously helped them; for\nChinese it was that the person was higher ranking; in Spain, that they\nwere a friend or acquaintance.12\nYour life will be unrecognizably different, depending on which\nINDIVIDUALIST CULTURES\ns introduced in chapter 7, a large percentage of cross-cultural\npsychology studies compare collectivist with individualist\ncultures. This almost always means comparisons between subjects from\ncollectivist East Asian cultures and Americans, coming from that mother\nof all individualist cultures.* As defined, collectivist cultures are about\nharmony, interdependence, conformity, and having the needs of the\ngroup guiding behavior, whereas individualist cultures are about\nautonomy, personal achievement, uniqueness, and the needs and rights of\nthe individual. Just to be a wee bit caustic, individualist culture can be\nsummarized by that classic American concept of “looking out for\nnumber one”; collectivist culture can be summarized by the archetypical\nexperience of American Peace Corps teachers in such countries—pose\nyour students a math question, and no one will volunteer the correct\nanswer because they don’t want to stand out and shame their classmates.\nIndividualist/collectivist contrasts are striking. In individualist\ncultures, people more frequently seek uniqueness and personal\naccomplishment, use first-person singular pronouns more often, define\nthemselves in terms that are personal (“I’m a contractor”) rather than\nrelational (“I’m a parent”), attribute their successes to intrinsic attributes\n(“I’m really good at X”) rather than to situational ones (“I was in the\nright place at the right time”). The past is more likely to be remembered\nvia events (“That’s the summer I learned to swim”) rather than social\ninteractions (“That’s the summer we became friends”). Motivation and\nsatisfaction are gained from self- rather than group-derived effort\n(reflecting the extent to which American individualism is about\nnoncooperation, rather than nonconformity). Competitive drive is about\ngetting ahead of everyone else. When asked to draw a “sociogram”—a\ndiagram of their social network, with circles representing themselves and\ntheir friends, connected by lines—Americans tend to place the circle\nMind tasks, more accurate in understanding someone else’s perspective\n—with “perspective” ranging from the other person’s abstract thoughts\nto how objects appear from where she is sitting. There is more blame of\nthe group when someone violates a norm due to peer pressure, and a\ngreater tendency to give situational explanations for behavior.\nCompetitive drive is about not falling behind everyone else. And when\ndrawing sociograms, the circle representing “yourself” is far from the\ncenter, and far from the biggest.\nNaturally, these cultural differences have biological correlates. For\nexample, subjects from individualist cultures strongly activate the\n(emotional) mPFC when looking at a picture of themselves, compared to\nlooking at a picture of a relative or friend; in contrast, the activation is\nfar less for East Asian subjects.* Another example is a favorite\ndemonstration of mine of cross-cultural differences in psychological\nstress—when asked in free recall, Americans are more likely than East\nAsians to remember times in which they influenced someone;\nconversely, East Asians are more likely to remember times when\nsomeone influenced them. Force Americans to talk at length about a time\nsomeone influenced them, or force East Asians to detail their influencing\nsomeone, and both secrete glucocorticoids from the stressfulness of\nhaving to recount this discomfiting event. And work by my Stanford\ncolleagues and friends Jeanne Tsai and Brian Knutson shows that\nmesolimbic dopamine systems activate in European Americans when\nlooking at excited facial expressions; in Chinese, when looking at calm\nexpressions.\nAs we will see in chapter 13, these cultural differences produce\ndifferent moral systems. In the most traditional of collectivist societies,\nconformity and morality are virtually synonymous and norm\nenforcement is more about shame (“What will people think if I did\nthat?”) than guilt (“How could I live with myself?”). Collectivist cultures\nfoster more utilitarian and consequentialist moral stances (for example, a\ngreater willingness for an innocent person to be jailed in order to prevent\na riot). The tremendous collectivist emphasis on the group produces a\ngreater degree of in-group bias than among individualist culture\njunction) when observing in-group members, but the bias was\nsignificantly greater among Korean subjects. In addition, subjects from\nboth individualist and collectivist cultures denigrate out-group members,\nbut only the former inflate assessments of their own group. In other\nwords, East Asians, unlike Americans, don’t have to puff up their own\ngroup to view others as inferior.14\nWhat is fascinating is the direction that some of these differences\ntake, as shown in approaches pioneered by one of the giants in this field,\nRichard Nisbett of the University of Michigan. Westerners problem-\nsolve in a more linear fashion, with more reliance on linguistic rather\nthan spatial coding. When asked to explain the movement of a ball, East\nAsians are more likely to invoke relational explanations built around the\ninteractions of the ball with its environment—friction—while Westerners\nfocus on intrinsic properties like weight and density. Westerners are more\naccurate at estimating length in absolute terms (“How long is that line?”)\nwhile East Asians are better with relational estimates (“How much\nlonger is this line than that?”). Or how’s this one: Consider a monkey, a\nbear, and a banana. Which two go together? Westerners think\ncategorically and choose the monkey and bear—they’re both animals.\nEast Asians think relationally and link the monkey and banana—if\nyou’re thinking of a monkey, also think of food it will need.15\nRemarkably, the cultural differences extend to sensory processing,\nwhere Westerners process information in a more focused manner, East\nAsians in a more holistic one.16 Show a picture of a person standing in\nthe middle of a complex scene; East Asians will be more accurate at\nremembering the scene, the context, while Westerners remember the\nperson in the middle. Remarkably, this is even observed on the level of\neye tracking—typically Westerners’ eyes first look at a picture’s center,\nwhile East Asians scan the overall scene. Moreover, force Westerners to\nfocus on the holistic context of a picture, or East Asians on the central\nsubject, and the frontal cortex works harder, activating more.\nAs covered in chapter 7, cultural values are first inculcated early in\nlife. So it’s no surprise that culture shapes our attitudes about success,\nNaturally, there are various caveats concerning\ncollectivist/individualist comparisons:\nThe most obvious is the perpetual “on the average”—\nthere are plenty of Westerners, for example, who are\nmore collectivist than plenty of East Asians. In general,\npeople who are most individualist by various personality\nmeasures are most individualist in neuroimaging\nstudies.17\nCultures change over time. For example, levels of\nconformity in East Asian cultures are declining (one\nstudy, for example, shows increased rates of babies in\nJapan receiving unique names). Moreover, one’s degree\nof inculcation into one’s culture can be altered rapidly.\nFor example, priming someone beforehand with\nindividualist or collectivist cultural cues shifts how\nholistically he processes a picture. This is especially true\nfor bicultural individuals.18\nWe will soon see about some genetic differences\nbetween collectivist and individualist populations. There\nis nothing resembling genetic destiny about this—the\nbest evidence for this conclusion comes from one of the\ncontrol groups in many of these studies, namely East\nAsian Americans. In general, it takes about a generation\nfor the descendants of East Asian immigrants to\nAmerica to be as individualist as European Americans.19\nObviously, “East Asians” and “Westerners” are not\nmonolithic entities. Just ask someone from Beijing\nversus the Tibetan steppes. Or stick three people from\nBerkeley, Brooklyn, and Biloxi in a stalled elevator for a\nfew hours and see what happens. As we will see, there is\nstriking variation within cultures.\nWhy should people in one part of the globe have developed\nexcept for the 0.9 percent pure Native Americans descend from people\nwho emigrated within the last five hundred years.20 And who were the\nimmigrants? Those in the settled world who were cranks, malcontents,\nrestless, heretical, black sheep, hyperactive, hypomanic, misanthropic,\nitchy, unconventional, yearning to be free, yearning to be rich, yearning\nto be out of their damn boring repressive little hamlet, yearning. Couple\nthat with the second reason—for the majority of its colonial and\nindependent history, America has had a moving frontier luring those\nwhose extreme prickly optimism made merely booking passage to the\nNew World insufficiently novel—and you’ve got America the\nindividualistic.\nWhy has East Asia provided textbook examples of collectivism?21\nThe key is how culture is shaped by the way people traditionally made a\nliving, which in turn is shaped by ecology. And in East Asia it’s all about\nrice. Rice, which was domesticated there roughly ten thousand years ago,\nrequires massive amounts of communal work. Not just backbreaking\nplanting and harvesting, which are done in rotation because the entire\nvillage is needed to harvest each family’s rice.* Collective labor is first\nneeded to transform the ecosystem—terracing mountains and building\nand maintaining irrigation systems for controlled flooding of paddies.\nAnd there’s the issue of dividing up water fairly—in Bali, religious\nauthority regulates water access, symbolized by iconic water temples.\nHow’s this for amazing—the Dujiuangyan irrigation system irrigates\nmore than five thousand square kilometers of rice farms near Changdu,\ndifficult to grow rice, and instead people have grown wheat for\nmillennia; this involves individual rather than collective farming. And by\nthe standard tests of individualist versus collectivist cultures (e.g., draw a\nsociogram, which two are most similar of a rabbit, dog, and carrot?)—\nthey look like Westerners. The region has two other markers of\nindividualism, namely higher rates of divorce and of inventiveness—\npatent filings—than in rice-growing regions. The roots of individualism,\nlikes those of wheat, run deep in northern China.\nThe links between ecology, mode of production, and culture are\nshown in a rare collectivist/individualist study not comparing Asians and\nWesterners.23 The authors studied a Turkish region on the Black Sea,\nwhere mountains hug the coastline. There, in close proximity, people live\nby fishing, by farming the narrow ribbon of land between the sea and the\nmountains, or as mountain shepherds. All three groups had the same\nlanguage, religion, and gene stock.\nHerding is solitary; while Turkish farmers and fishermen (and\nwomen) were no Chinese rice farmers, they at least worked their fields in\ncategorically, while the others grouped relationally, pairing gloves and\nhands. In the authors’ words, “social interdependence fosters holistic\nthinking.”\nThis theme appears in another study, comparing Jewish boys from\neither observant Orthodox homes (dominated by endless shared rules\nabout beliefs and behaviors) with ones from far more individualist\nsecular homes. Visual processing was more holistic in the Orthodox,\nmore focused in the secular.24\nThe East Asian/Western collectivist/individualist dichotomy has a\nfascinating genetic correlate.25 Recall from the last chapter dopamine\nand DRD4, the gene for the D4 receptor. It’s extraordinarily variable,\nwith at least twenty-five human variants (with lesser variability in other\nprimates). Moreover, the variation isn’t random, inconsequential drift of\nDNA sequences; instead there has been strong positive selection for\nvariants. Most common is the 4R variant, occurring in about half of East\nAsians and European Americans. There’s also the 7R variant, producing\na receptor less responsive to dopamine in the cortex, associated with\nnovelty seeking, extroversion, and impulsivity. It predates modern\nhumans but became dramatically more common ten to twenty thousand\nVisit bit.ly/2nsuHz9 for a larger version of this graph.\nSo which came first, 7R frequency or cultural style? The 4R and 7R\nvariants, along with the 2R, occur worldwide, implying they already\nexisted when humans radiated out of Africa 60,000 to 130,000 years ago.\nClassic work by Kenneth Kidd of Yale, examining the distribution of 7R,\nshows something remarkable.\nStarting at the left of the figure above, there’s roughly a 10 to 25\npercent incidence of 7R in various African, European, and Middle\nEastern populations. Jumping to the right side of the figure, there’s a\nslightly higher incidence among the descendants of those who started\nisland-hopping from mainland Asia to Malaysia and New Guinea. The\nsame for folks whose ancestors migrated to North America via the\nBering land bridge about fifteen thousand years ago—the Muskoke,\nAmazon basin—the Ticuna, Surui, and Karitiana—with a roughly 70\npercent incidence of 7R, the highest in the world. In other words, the\ndescendants of people who, having made it to the future downtown\nAnchorage, decided to just keep going for another six thousand miles.*\nA high incidence of 7R, associated with impulsivity and novelty seeking,\nis the legacy of humans who made the greatest migrations in human\nhistory.\nAnd then in the middle of the chart is the near-zero incidence of 7R\nin China, Cambodia, Japan, and Taiwan (among the Ami and Atayal).\nWhen East Asians domesticated rice and invented collectivist society,\nthere was massive selection against the 7R variant; in Kidd’s words, it\nwas “nearly lost” in these populations.* Maybe the bearers of 7R broke\ntheir necks inventing hang gliding or got antsy and tried to walk to\nAlaska but drowned because there was no longer a Bering land bridge.\nMaybe they were less desirable mates. Regardless of the cause, East\nAsian cultural collectivism coevolved with selection against the 7R\nvariant.*\nThus, in this most studied of cultural contrasts, we see clustering of\necological factors, modes of production, cultural differences, and\ndifferences in endocrinology, neurobiology, and gene frequencies.* The\ncultural contrasts appear in likely ways—e.g., morality, empathy, child-\nrearing practices, competition, cooperation, definitions of happiness—\nnother important link among ecology, mode of production, and\nculture is seen in dry, hardscrabble, wide-open environments too\ntough for agriculture. This is the world of nomadic pastoralism—people\nwandering the desert, steppes, or tundra with their herds.\nThere are Bedouins in Arabia, Tuareg in North Africa, Somalis and\nMaasai in East Africa, Sami of northern Scandinavia, Gujjars in India,\nYörük in Turkey, Tuvans of Mongolia, Aymara in the Andes. There are\nherds of sheep, goats, cows, llamas, camels, yaks, horses, or reindeer,\nwith the pastoralists living off their animals’ meat, milk, and blood and\ntrading their wool and hides.\nAnthropologists have long noted similarities in pastoralist cultures\nborn of their tough environments and the typically minimal impact of\ncentralized government and the rule of law. In that isolated toughness\nstands a central fact of pastoralism: thieves can’t steal the crops on\nsomeone’s farm or the hundreds of edible plants eaten by hunter-\ngatherers, but they can steal someone’s herd. This is the vulnerability of\npastoralism, a world of rustlers and raiders.\nThis generates various correlates of pastoralism:26\nMilitarism abounds. Pastoralists, particularly in deserts, with\ntheir far-flung members tending the herds, are a spawning\nground for warrior classes. And with them typically come (a)\nmilitary trophies as stepping-stones to societal status; (b) death\nin battle as a guarantee of a glorious afterlife; (c) high rates of\neconomic polygamy and mistreatment of women; and (d)\nauthoritarian parenting. It is rare for pastoralists to be pastoral, in\nthe sense of Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony.\nWorldwide, monotheism is relatively rare; to the extent that it\ndoes occur, it is disproportionately likely among desert\nyour God” and “There is but one god and his name is Allah” and\n“There will be no gods before me”—dictates like these\nproliferate. As implied in the final quote, desert monotheism\ndoes not always come with only one supernatural being—\nmonotheistic religions are replete with angels and djinns and\ndevils. But they sure come with a hierarchy, minor deities paling\nbefore the Omnipotent One, who tends to be highly\ninterventionist both in the heavens and on earth. In contrast,\nthink of tropical rain forest, teeming with life, where you can\nfind more species of ants on a single tree than in all of Britain.\nLetting a hundred deities bloom in equilibrium must seem the\nmost natural thing in the world.\nPastoralism fosters cultures of honor. As introduced in chapter 7,\nthese are about rules of civility, courtesy, and hospitality,\nespecially to the weary traveler because, after all, aren’t all\nherders often weary travelers? Even more so, cultures of honor\nare about taking retribution after affronts to self, family, or clan,\nand reputational consequences for failing to do so. If they take\nyour camel today and you do nothing, tomorrow they will take\nthe rest of your herd, plus your wives and daughters.*\nFew of humanity’s low or high points are due to the culturally based\nactions of, say, Sami wandering the north of Finland with their reindeer,\nor Maasai cow herders in the Serengeti. Instead the most pertinent\ncultures of honor are ones in more Westernized settings. “Culture of\nhonor” has been used to describe the workings of the Mafia in Sicily, the\npatterns of violence in rural nineteenth-century Ireland, and the causes\nand consequences of retributive killings by inner-city gangs. All occur in\ncircumstances of resource competition (including the singular resource\nof being the last side to do a retributive killing in a vendetta), of a power\nvacuum provided by the minimal presence of the rule of law, and where\nprestige is ruinously lost if challenges are left unanswered and where the\nHospitality, chivalry toward women, and emphasis on social decorum\nand etiquette are long associated with the South.28 In addition, the South\ntraditionally emphasizes legacy, long cultural memory, and continuity of\nfamily—in rural Kentucky in the 1940s, for example, 70 percent of men\nhad the same first name as their father, far more than in the North. When\ncoupled with lesser mobility in the South, honor in need of defense\nreadily extends to family, clan, and place. For example, by the time the\nHatfields and McCoys famously began their nearly thirty-year feud in\n1863,* they had lived in the same region of the West Virginia/Kentucky\nborder for nearly a century. The Southern sense of honor in place is also\nseen in Robert E. Lee; he opposed Southern secession, even made some\nambiguous statements that could be viewed as opposed to slavery. Yet\nwhen offered the command of the Union Army by Lincoln, Lee wrote, “I\nwish to live under no other government and there is no sacrifice I am not\nready to make for the preservation of the Union save that of honor.”\nWhen Virginia chose secession, he regretfully fulfilled his sense of honor\nto his home and led the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.\nIn the South, defense of honor was, above all, an act of self-\nreliance.29 The Southerner Andrew Jackson was advised by his dying\nmother to never seek redress from the law for any grievances, to instead\nbe a man and take things into his own hands. That he certainly did, with\na history of dueling (even fatally) and brawling; on his final day as\npresident, he articulated two regrets in leaving office—that he “had been\nunable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun.” Carrying out\njustice personally was viewed as a requirement in the absence of a\nfunctional legal system. At best, legal justice and individual justice were\nin uneasy equilibrium in the nineteenth-century South; in the words of\nthe Southern historian Bertram Wyatt-Brown, “Common law and lynch\nlaw were ethically compatible. The first enabled the legal profession to\npresent traditional order, and the second conferred upon ordinary men\nthe prerogative of ensuring that community values held ultimate\nsovereignty.”\nThe core of retribution for honor violations was, of course, violence.\nSticks and stones might break your bones, but names will cause you to\nThe result of this all is a long, still-extant history of high rates of\nviolence in the South. But crucially, violence of a particular type. I once\nheard it summarized by a Southern studies scholar describing the\nweirdness of leaving the rural South to start grad school in a strange\nplace, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where families would get together at\nFourth of July picnics and no one would shoot each other. Nisbett and\nDov Cohen have shown that the high rates of violence, particularly of\nmurder, by white Southern males are not features of large cities or about\nattempts to gain material goods—we’re not talking liquor store stickups.\nInstead the violence is disproportionately rural, among people who know\neach other, and concerns slights to honor (that sleazebag cousin thought\n286\nR. Nisbett and D. Cohen, Culture of Honor: The Psychology of Violence in the\nSouth (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1996).\nVisit bit.ly/2neHKTg for a larger version of this graph.\n\nVisit bit.ly/2mNCQ4g for a larger version of this graph.\nSouthern violence was explored in one of the all-time coolest\npsychology studies, involving the use of a word rare in science journals,\nconducted by Nisbett and Cohen. Undergraduate male subjects had a\nblood sample taken. They then filled out a questionnaire about\nsomething and were then supposed to drop it off down the hall. It was in\nthe narrow hallway, filled with file cabinets, that the experiment\nhappened. Half the subjects traversed the corridor uneventfully. But with\nhalf, a confederate (get it? ha-ha) of the psychologists, a big beefy guy,\napproached from the opposite direction. As the subject and the plant\nsqueezed by each other, the latter would jostle the subject and, in an\nirritated voice, say the magic word—“asshole”—and march on. Subject\nwould continue down the hall to drop off the questionnaire.\nWhat was the response to this insult? It depended. Subjects from the\nSouth, but not from elsewhere, showed massive increases in levels of\ntestosterone and glucocorticoids—anger, rage, stress. Subjects were then\ntold a scenario where a guy observes a male acquaintance making a pass\nat his fiancée—what happens next in the story? In control subjects,\nSoutherners were a bit more likely than Northerners to imagine a violent\ncombatants’ mind-sets from growing up herding yak. Nonetheless,\npastoralist roots have been suggested to explain the Southern culture of\nhonor. The theory as first propounded by historian David Hackett Fischer\nin 1989: Early American regionalism arose from colonists in different\nparts of America coming from different places.31 There were the\nPilgrims from East Anglia in New England. Quakers from North\nMidlands going to Pennsylvania and Delaware. Southern English\nindentured servants to Virginia. And the rest of the South?\nDisproportionately herders from Scotland, Ireland, and northern\nEngland.\nNaturally, the idea has some problems. Pastoralists from the British\nIsles mostly settled in the hill country of the South, whereas the honor\nculture is stronger in the Southern lowlands. Others have suggested that\nthe Southern ethos of retributive violence was born from the white\nSouthern nightmare scenario of slave uprisings. But most historians have\nfound a lot of validity in Fischer’s idea.\nViolence Turned Inward\nCulture-of-honor violence is not just about outside threat—the camel\nrustlers from the next tribe, the jerk at the roadhouse who came on to\nsome guy’s girlfriend. Instead it is equally defined by its role when honor\nis threatened from within. Chapter 11 examines when norm violations by\nmembers of your own group provoke cover-ups, excuses, or leniency,\nand when they provoke severe public punishment. The latter is when\n“you’ve dishonored us in front of everyone,” a culture-of-honor\nspecialty. Which raises the issue of honor killings.\nWhat constitutes an honor killing? Someone does something\nconsidered to tarnish the reputation of the family. A family member then\nkills the despoiler, often publicly, thereby regaining face. Mind-boggling.\nSome characteristics of honor killings:\nWhile they have been widespread historically,\nmarriage. Seeking to divorce an abusive spouse and/or a\nspouse to whom they were forcibly married as a child.\nSeeking education. Resisting constraining religious\northodoxy, such as covering their head. Marrying, living\nwith, dating, interacting with, or speaking to an\nunapproved male. Infidelity. Religious conversion. In\nother words, a woman resisting being the property of her\nmale relatives. And also, stunningly, staggeringly, a\nfrequent cause of honor killings is being raped.\nIn the rare instances of men being subject to honor\nkillings, the typical cause is homosexuality.\nThere has been debate as to whether honor killings are “just”\ndomestic violence, and whether morbid Western fascination with them\nreflects anti-Muslim bias;32 if some Baptist guy in Alabama murders his\nwife because she wants a divorce, no one frames it as a “Christian honor\nkilling” reflecting deep religious barbarity. But honor killings typically\ndiffer from garden-variety domestic violence in several ways: (a) The\nlatter is usually committed by a male partner; the former are usually\ncommitted by male blood relatives, often with the approval of and\nfacilitation by female relatives. (b) The former is rarely an act of\nspontaneous passion but instead is often planned with the approval of\nfamily members. (c) Honor killings are often rationalized on religious\ngrounds, presented without remorse, and approved by religious leaders.\n(d) Honor killings are carried out openly—after all, how else can\n“honor” be regained for the family?—and the chosen perpetrator is often\nan underage relative (e.g., a younger brother), to minimize the extent of\nsentencing for the act.\nBy some pretty meaningful criteria, this is not “just” domestic\nviolence. According to estimates by the UN and advocacy groups, five to\ntwenty thousand honor killings occur annually. And they are not\nrestricted to far-off, alien lands. Instead they occur throughout the West,\nwhere patriarchs expect their daughters to be untouched by the world\nNorway, married at 13; killed by husband after requesting a divorce; age 22.\nPalestina Isa, USA, killed by parents for dating someone outside the faith,\nlistening to American music, and secretly getting a part-time job; age 16. Aqsa\nParvez, Canada, killed by father and brother for refusing to wear a hajib; age 16.\nGhazala Khan, Denmark, killed by nine family members for refusing an\narranged marriage; age 19. Fadime Sahindal, Sweden, killed by father for\nrefusing an arranged marriage; age 27. Hatun Surucu Kird, Germany, killed by\nbrother after divorcing the cousin she was forced to marry at age 16; age 23.\nHina Salem, Italy, killed by father for refusing an arranged marriage; age 20.\nCULTURES\nnother meaningful way to think about cross-cultural variation\nconcerns how unequally resources (e.g., land, food, material\ngoods, power, or prestige) are distributed.33 Hunter-gatherer societies\nhave typically been egalitarian, as we’ll soon see, throughout hominin\nhistory. Inequality emerged when “stuff”—things to possess and\naccumulate—was invented following animal domestication and the\ndevelopment of agriculture. The more stuff, reflecting surplus, job\nspecialization, and technological sophistication, the greater the potential\ninequality. Moreover, inequality expands enormously when cultures\ninvent inheritance within families. Once invented, inequality became\npervasive. Among traditional pastoralist or small-scale agricultural\nsocieties, levels of wealth inequality match or exceed those in the most\nunequal industrialized societies.\nWhy have stratified cultures dominated the planet, generally\nreplacing more egalitarian ones? For population biologist Peter Turchin,\nthe answer is that stratified cultures are ideally suited to being\nconquerors—they come with chains of command.34 Both empirical and\ntheoretical work suggests that in addition, in unstable environments\nstratified societies are “better able to survive resource shortages [than\negalitarian cultures] by sequestering mortality in the lower classes.” In\nother words, when times are tough, the unequal access to wealth\nbecomes the unequal distribution of misery and death. Notably, though,\nstratification is not the only solution to such instability—this is where\nhunter-gatherers benefit from being able to pick up and move.\nA score of millennia after the invention of inequality, Westernized\nsocieties at the extremes of the inequality continuum differ strikingly.\nOne difference concerns “social capital.” Economic capital is the\ncollective quantity of goods, services, and financial resources. Social\ncapital is the collective quantity of resources such as trust, reciprocity,\nsituations where one could easily look away. The second question is how\nmany organizations someone participates in—from the purely\nrecreational (e.g., a bowling league) to the vital (e.g., unions, tenant\ngroups, co-op banks). A community with high levels of such\nparticipation is one where people feel efficacious, where institutions\nwork transparently enough that people believe they can effect change.\nPeople who feel helpless don’t join organizations.\nPut simply, cultures with more income inequality have less social\ncapital.35 Trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality,\nwhereas hierarchy is about domination and asymmetry. Moreover, a\nculture highly unequal in material resources is almost always also\nunequal in the ability to pull the strings of power, to have efficacy, to be\nvisible. (For example, as income inequality grows, the percentage of\npeople who bother voting generally declines.) Almost by definition, you\ncan’t have a society with both dramatic income inequality and plentiful\nsocial capital. Or translated from social science–ese, marked inequality\nmakes people crummier to one another.\nThis can be shown in various ways, studied on the levels of\nWesternized countries, states, provinces, cities, and towns. The more\nincome inequality, the less likely people are to help someone (in an\nexperimental setting) and the less generous and cooperative they are in\neconomic games. Early in the chapter, I discussed cross-cultural rates of\nbullying and of “antisocial punishment,” where people in economic\ngames punish overly generous players more than they punish cheaters.*\nStudies of these phenomena show that high levels of inequality and/or\nlow levels of social capital in a country predict high rates of bullying and\nof antisocial punishment.36\nChapter 11 examines the psychology with which we think about\npeople of different socioeconomic status; no surprise, in unequal\nsocieties, people on top generate justifications for their status.37 And the\nmore inequality, the more the powerful adhere to myths about the hidden\nblessings of subordination—“They may be poor, but at least they’re\nhappy/honest/loved.” In the words of the authors of one paper, “Unequal\nin public health, namely the “socioeconomic status (SES)/health\ngradient”—as noted, in culture after culture, the poorer you are, the\nworse your health, the higher the incidence and impact of numerous\ndiseases, and the shorter your life expectancy.38\nExtensive research has examined the SES/health gradient. Four quick\nrule-outs: (a) The gradient isn’t due to poor health driving down people’s\nSES. Instead low SES, beginning in childhood, predicts subsequent poor\nhealth in adulthood. (b) It’s not that the poor have lousy health and\neveryone else is equally healthy. Instead, for every step down the SES\nladder, starting from the top, average health worsens. (c) The gradient\nisn’t due to less health-care access for the poor; it occurs in countries\nwith universal health care, is unrelated to utilization of health-care\nsystems, and occurs for diseases unrelated to health-care access (e.g.,\njuvenile diabetes, where having five checkups a day wouldn’t change its\nincidence). (d) Only about a third of the gradient is explained by lower\nSES equaling more health risk factors (e.g., lead in your water, nearby\ntoxic waste dump, more smoking and drinking) and fewer protective\nfactors (e.g., everything from better mattresses for overworked backs to\nhealth club memberships).\nWhat then is the principal cause of the gradient? Key work by Nancy\nAdler at UCSF showed that it’s not so much being poor that predicts\npoor health. It’s feeling poor—someone’s subjective SES (e.g., the\nanswer to “How do you feel you’re doing financially when you compare\nyourself with other people?”) is at least as good a predictor of health as is\nobjective SES.\nCrucial work by the social epidemiologist Richard Wilkinson of the\nUniversity of Nottingham added to this picture: it’s not so much that\npoverty predicts poor health; it’s poverty amid plenty—income\ninequality. The surest way to make someone feel poor is to rub their nose\nin what they don’t have.\nWhy should high degrees of income inequality (independent of\nabsolute levels of poverty) make the poor unhealthy? Two overlapping\npathways:\npredictability, outlets for frustration, and social support—\nchronically activates the stress response, which, as we saw in\nchapter 4, corrodes health in numerous ways.\nA neomaterialist explanation has been offered by Robert Evans\nof the University of British Columbia and George Kaplan of the\nUniversity of Michigan. If you want to improve health and\nquality of life for the average person in a society, you spend\nmoney on public goods—better public transit, safer streets,\ncleaner water, better public schools, universal health care. But\nthe more income inequality, the greater the financial distance\nbetween the wealthy and the average and thus the less direct\nbenefit the wealthy feel from improving public goods. Instead\nthey benefit more from dodging taxes and spending on their\nprivate good—a chauffeur, a gated community, bottled water,\nprivate schools, private health insurance. As Evans writes, “The\nmore unequal are incomes in a society, the more pronounced will\nbe the disadvantages to its better-off members from public\nexpenditure, and the more resources will those members have\n[available to them] to mount effective political opposition” (e.g.,\nlobbying). Evans notes how this “secession of the wealthy”\npromotes “private affluence and public squalor.” Meaning worse\nhealth for the have-nots.39\nThe inequality/health link paves the way for understanding how\ninequality also makes for more crime and violence. I could copy and\npaste the previous stretch of writing, replacing “poor health” with “high\ncrime,” and I’d be set. Poverty is not a predictor of crime as much as\npoverty amid plenty is. For example, extent of income inequality is a\nmajor predictor of rates of violent crime across American states and\nacross industrialized nations.40\nWhy does income inequality lead to more crime? Again, there’s the\npsychosocial angle—inequality means less social capital, less trust,\ncooperation, and people watching out for one another. And there’s the\nhealth, the psychosocial and neomaterial routes synergize.\nA final depressing point about inequality and violence. As we’ve\nseen, a rat being shocked activates a stress response. But a rat being\nshocked who can then bite the hell out of another rat has less of a stress\nresponse. Likewise with baboons—if you are low ranking, a reliable way\nto reduce glucocorticoid secretion is to displace aggression onto those\neven lower in the pecking order. It’s something similar here—despite the\nconservative nightmare of class warfare, of the poor rising up to\nslaughter the wealthy, when inequality fuels violence, it is mostly the\npoor preying on the poor.\nThis point is made with a great metaphor for the consequences of\nsocietal inequality.41 The frequency of “air rage”—a passenger majorly,\ndisruptively, dangerously losing it over something on a flight—has been\nincreasing. Turns out there’s a substantial predictor of it: if the plane has\na first-class section, there’s almost a fourfold increase in the odds of a\ncoach passenger having air rage. Force coach passengers to walk through\nfirst class when boarding, and you more than double the chances further.\nNothing like starting a flight by being reminded of where you fit into the\nclass hierarchy. And completing the parallel with violent crime, when air\nrage is boosted in coach by reminders of inequality, the result is not a\ncrazed coach passenger sprinting into first class to shout Marxist slogans.\nDENSITY, POPULATION\nHETEROGENEITY\nhe year 2008 marked a human milestone, a transition point nine\nthousand years in the making: for the first time, the majority of\nhumans lived in cities.\nThe human trajectory from semipermanent settlements to the\nmegalopolis has been beneficial. In the developed world, when\ncompared with rural populations, city dwellers are typically healthier and\nwealthier; larger social networks facilitate innovation; because of\neconomies of scale, cities leave a smaller per-capita ecological\nfootprint.42\nUrban living makes for a different sort of brain. This was shown in a\n2011 study of subjects from a range of cities, towns, and rural settings\nwho underwent an experimental social stressor while being brain-\nscanned. The key finding was that the larger the population where\nsomeone lived, the more reactive their amygdala was during that\nstressor.*43\nMost important for our purposes, urbanized humans do something\ncompletely unprecedented among primates—regularly encountering\nstrangers who are never seen again, fostering the invention of the\nanonymous act. After all, it wasn’t until nineteenth-century urbanization\nthat crime fiction was invented, typically set in cities—in traditional\nsettings there’s no whodunit, since everyone knows what everyone dun.\nGrowing cultures had to invent mechanisms for norm enforcement\namong strangers. For example, across numerous traditional cultures, the\nlarger the group, the greater the punishment for norm violations and the\nmore cultural emphases on equitable treatment of strangers. Moreover,\nlarger groups evolved “third-party punishment” (stay tuned for more in\nthe next chapter)—rather than victims punishing norm violators,\nFinally, life in larger populations fosters the ultimate third-party\npunisher. As documented by Ara Norenzayan of the University of British\nColumbia, it is only when societies grow large enough that people\nregularly encounter strangers that “Big Gods” emerge—deities who are\nconcerned with human morality and punish our transgressions.45\nSocieties with frequent anonymous interactions tend to outsource\npunishment to gods.* In contrast, hunter-gatherers’ gods are less likely\nthan chance to care whether we’ve been naughty or nice. Moreover, in\nfurther work across a range of traditional cultures, Norenzayan has\nshown that the more informed and punitive people consider their\nmoralistic gods to be, the more generous they are to coreligionist\nstrangers in a financial allocation game.\nSeparate from the size of a population, how about its density? One\nstudy surveying thirty-three developed countries characterized each\nnation’s “tightness”—the extent to which the government is autocratic,\ndissent suppressed, behavior monitored, transgressions punished, life\nregulated by religious orthodoxy, citizens viewing various behaviors as\ninappropriate (e.g., singing in an elevator, cursing at a job interview).46\nHigher population density predicted tighter cultures—both high density\nin the present and, remarkably, historically, in the year 1500.\nThe issue of population density’s effects on behavior gave rise to a\nwell-known phenomenon, mostly well known incorrectly.\nIn the 1950s John Calhoun at the National Institute of Mental Health\nasked what happens to rat behavior at higher population densities,\nresearch prompted by America’s ever-growing cities.47 And in papers for\nboth scientists and the lay public, Calhoun gave a clear answer: high-\ndensity living produced “deviant” behavior and “social pathology.” Rats\nbecame violent; adults killed and cannibalized one another; females were\naggressive to their infants; there was indiscriminate hypersexuality\namong males (e.g., trying to mate with females who weren’t in estrus).\nThe writing about the subject, starting with Calhoun, was colorful.\nThe bloodless description of “high-density living” was replaced with\n“crowding.” Aggressive males were described as “going berserk,”\naggressive females as “Amazons.” Rats living in these “rat slums”\nThe work was hugely influential, taught to psychologists, architects,\nand urban planners; more than a million reprints were requested of\nCalhoun’s original Scientific American report; sociologists, journalists,\nand politicians explicitly compared residents of particular housing\nprojects and Calhoun’s rats. The take-home message sent ripples through\nthe American heartland destined for the chaotic sixties: inner cities breed\nviolence, pathology, and social deviance.\nCalhoun’s rats were more complicated than this (something\nunderemphasized in his lay writing). High-density living doesn’t make\nrats more aggressive. Instead it makes aggressive rats more aggressive.\n(This echoes the findings that neither testosterone, nor alcohol, nor\nmedia violence uniformly increases violence. Instead they make violent\nindividuals more sensitive to violence-evoking social cues.) In contrast,\ncrowding makes unaggressive individuals more timid. In other words, it\nexaggerates preexisting social tendencies.\nCalhoun’s erroneous conclusions about rats don’t even hold for\nhumans. In some cities—Chicago, for example, circa 1970—higher\npopulation density in neighborhoods does indeed predict more violence.\nNevertheless, some of the highest-density places on earth—Hong Kong,\nSingapore, and Tokyo—have miniscule rates of violence. High-density\nliving is not synonymous with aggression in rats or humans.\n—\nThe preceding sections examined the effects of living with lots of people,\nand in close quarters. How about the effects of living with different kinds\nof people? Diversity. Heterogeneity. Admixture. Mosaicism.\nTwo opposite narratives come to mind:\nMister Rogers’ neighborhood: When people of differing\nethnicities, races, or religions live together, they experience the\nsimilarities rather than the differences and view one another as\nindividuals, transcending stereotypes. Trade flows, fostering\nfairness and mutuality. Inevitably, dichotomies dissolve with\nintermarriage, and soon you’re happily watching your grandkid\nof proud cultural identification feels like a hostile dig to the other\nside, public spaces become proving grounds for turf battles,\ncommons become tragedies.\nSurprise: both outcomes occur; the final chapter explores\ncircumstances where intergroup contact leads to one rather than the\nother. Most interesting at this juncture is the importance of the spatial\nqualities of the heterogeneity. Consider a region filled with people from\nElbonia and Kerplakistan, two hostile groups, each providing half the\npopulation. At one extreme, the land is split down the middle, each\ngroup occupying one side, producing a single boundary between the two.\nAt the other extreme is a microcheckerboard of alternating ethnicities,\nwhere each square on the grid is one person large, producing a vast\nquantity of boundaries between Elbonians and Kerplakis.\nIntuitively, both scenarios should bias against conflict. In the\ncondition of maximal separation, each group has a critical mass to be\nlocally sovereign, and the total length of border, and thus of the amount\nof intergroup elbow rubbing, is minimized. In the scenario of maximal\nmixing, no patch of ethnic homogeneity is big enough to foster a self-\nidentity that can dominate a public space—big deal if someone raises a\nflag between their feet and declares their square meter to be the Elbonian\nEmpire or a Kerplakistani Republic.\nBut in the real world things are always in between the two extremes,\nand with variation in the average size of each “ethnic patch.” Does patch\nsize, and thus amount of border, influence relations?\nThis was explored in a fascinating paper from the aptly named New\nEngland Complex Systems Institute, down the block from MIT.49 The\nauthors first constructed an Elbonian/Kerplaki mixture, with individuals\nrandomly distributed as pixels on a grid. Pixels were given a certain\ndegree of mobility plus a tendency to assort with other pixels of the same\ntype. As self-assortment progresses, something emerges—islands and\npeninsulas of Elbonians amid a sea of Kerplakis, or the reverse, a\ncondition that intuitively seems rife with potential intergroup violence.\nThe authors then considered a balkanized region, namely the\nBalkans, ex-Yugoslavia, in 1990. This was just before Serbians,\nBosnians, Croatians, and Albanians commenced Europe’s worst war\nsince World War II, the war that taught us the names of places like\nSrebrenica and people like Slobodan Milošević. Using a similar analysis,\nwith ethnic island size varying from roughly twenty to sixty kilometers\nin diameter, they identified the spots theoretically most rife for violence;\nremarkably, this predicted the sites of major fighting and massacres in\nthe war.\nIn the words of the authors, violence can arise “due to the structure of\nboundaries between groups rather than as a result of inherent conflicts\nbetween the groups themselves.” They then showed that the clarity of\nborders matters as well. Good, clear-cut fences—e.g., mountain ranges\nor rivers between groups—make for good neighbors. “Peace does not\ndepend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well defined\ntopographical and political boundaries separating groups, allowing for\npartial autonomy within a single country,” the authors concluded.\nThus, not only do size, density, and heterogeneity of populations help\nn times of crisis—the London Blitz, New York after 9/11, San\nFrancisco after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake—people pull\ntogether.* That’s cool. But in contrast, chronic, pervasive, corrosive\nmenace doesn’t necessarily do the same to people or cultures.\nThe primal menace of hunger has left historical marks. Back to that\nstudy of differences between countries’ tightness (where “tight”\ncountries were characterized by autocracy, suppression of dissent, and\nomnipresence and enforcement of behavior norms).50 What sorts of\ncountries are tighter?* In addition to the high population-density\ncorrelates mentioned earlier, there are also more historical food\nshortages, lower food intake, and lower levels of protein and fat in the\ndiet. In other words, these are cultures chronically menaced by empty\nstomachs.\nCultural tightness was also predicted by environmental degradation\n—less available farmland or clean water, more pollution. Similarly,\nhabitat degradation and depletion of animal populations worsens conflict\nin cultures dependent on bush meat. And a major theme of Jared\nDiamond’s magisterial Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or\nSucceed is how environmental degradation explains the violent collapse\nof many civilizations.\nThen there’s disease. In chapter 15 we’ll touch on “behavioral\nimmunity,” the ability of numerous species to detect cues of illness in\nother individuals; as we’ll see, implicit cues about infectious disease\nmake people more xenophobic. Similarly, historical prevalence of\ninfectious disease predicts a culture’s openness to outsiders. Moreover,\nother predictors of cultural tightness include having high historical\nincidence of pandemics, of high infant and child mortality rates, and of\nhigher cumulative average number of years lost to communicable\ndisease.\nObviously, weather influences the incidence of organized violence—\nconsider the centuries of European wars taking a hiatus during the worst\nthe annual reality of winter coming.* Larger-scale changes in weather\nare known to be consequential. In the tightness study, cultural tightness\nwas also predicted by a history of floods, droughts, and cyclones.\nAnother pertinent aspect of weather concerns the Southern Oscillation,\nknown as El Niño, the multiyear fluctuation of average water\ntemperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Niños, occurring about\nevery dozen years, involve warmer, drier weather (with the opposite\nduring La Niña years) and are associated in many developing countries\nwith droughts and food shortages. Over the last fifty years El Niños have\nroughly doubled the likelihood of civil conflict, mostly by stoking the\nfires of preexisting conflicts.\nThe relationship between drought and violence is tricky. The civil\nconflict referred to in the previous paragraph concerned deaths caused by\nbattle between governmental and nongovernmental forces (i.e., civil\nwars or insurgencies). Thus, rather than fighting over a watering hole or\na field for grazing, this was fighting for modern perks of power. But in\ntraditional settings drought may mean spending more time foraging or\nhauling water for your crops. Raiding to steal the other group’s women\nisn’t a high priority, and why rustle someone else’s cows when you can’t\neven feed your own? Conflict declines.\nInterestingly, something similar occurs in baboons. Normally,\nbaboons in rich ecosystems like the Serengeti need forage only a few\nhours a day. Part of what endears baboons to primatologists is that this\nleaves them about nine hours daily to devote to social machinations—\ntrysting and jousting and backbiting. In 1984 there was a devastating\ndrought in East Africa. Among baboons, while there was still sufficient\nfood, it took every waking moment to get enough calories; aggression\ndecreased.52\nSo ecological duress can increase or decrease aggression. This raises\nthe key issue of what global warming will do to our best and worst\nbehaviors. There will definitely be some upsides. Some regions will have\nlonger growing seasons, increasing the food supply and reducing\ntensions. Some people will eschew conflict, being preoccupied with\nsaving their homes from the encroaching ocean or growing pineapples in\n303\nconflict. For starters, warmer temperatures rile people up—in cities\nduring the summers, for every three degree increase in temperature, there\nwas a 4 percent increase in interpersonal violence and 14 percent in\ngroup violence. But global warming’s bad news is more global—\ndesertification, loss of arable land due to rising seas, more droughts. One\ninfluential meta-analysis projected 16 percent and 50 percent increases in\ninterpersonal and group violence, respectively, in some regions by\n2050.53\n\nime for a quick hit-and-run about religion before considering it in\nthe final chapter.\nTheories abound as to why humans keep inventing religions. It’s\nmore than a human pull toward the supernatural; as stated in one review,\n“Mickey Mouse has supernatural powers, but no one worships or would\nfight—or kill—for him. Our social brains may help explain why children\nthe world over are attracted to talking teacups, but religion is much more\nthan that.” Why does religion arise? Because it makes in-groups more\ncooperative and viable (stay tuned for more in the next chapter). Because\nhumans need personification and to see agency and causality when\nfacing the unknown. Or maybe inventing deities is an emergent by-\nproduct of the architecture of our social brains.54\nAmid these speculations, far more boggling is the variety of the\nthousands of religions we’ve invented. They vary as to number and\ngender of deities; whether there’s an afterlife, what it’s like, and what it\ntakes to enter; whether deities judge or interfere with humans; whether\nwe are born sinful or pure and whether sexuality changes those states;\nwhether the myth of a religion’s founder is of sacredness from the start\n(so much so that, say, wise men visit the infant founder) or of a sybarite\nwho reforms (e.g., Siddhārtha’s transition from palace life to being the\nBuddha); whether the religion’s goal is attracting new followers (say,\nwith exciting news—e.g., an angel visited me in Manchester, New York,\nand gave me golden plates) or retaining members (we’ve got a covenant\nwith God, so stick with us). On and on.\nThere are some pertinent patterns amid this variation. As noted,\ndesert cultures are prone toward monotheistic religions; rain forest\ndwellers, polytheistic ones. Nomadic pastoralists’ deities tend to value\nwar and valor in battle as an entrée to a good afterlife. Agriculturalists\ninvent gods who alter the weather. As noted, once cultures get large\nenough that anonymous acts are possible, they start inventing moralizing\ngods. Gods and religious orthodoxy dominate more in cultures with\nand very effectively transmits those values; (b) religion fosters the best\nand worst of our behaviors; (c) it’s complicated.\n—\nWe’ve now looked at various cultural factors—collectivism versus\nindividualism, egalitarian versus hierarchical distribution of resources,\nand so on. While there are others to consider, it’s time to shift to the\nchapter’s final topic. This is one that has generated shit storms of debate\nas old as the weathered layers of Olduvai Gorge and as fresh as a\nes, those guys.\nTo invoke some estimates, anatomically modern humans\nemerged about 200,000 years ago, and behaviorally modern ones about\n40,000 to 50,000 years ago; animal domestication is 10,000 to 20,000\nyears old, agriculture around 12,000. After plant domestication, it was\nroughly 5,000 more years until “history” began with civilizations in\nEgypt, the Mideast, China, and the New World. When in this arc of\nhistory was war invented? Does material culture lessen or worsen\ntendencies toward war? Do successful warriors leave more copies of\ntheir genes? Has the centralization of authority by civilization actually\ncivilized us, providing a veneer of socially contractual restraint? Have\nhumans become more or less decent to one another over the course of\nhistory? Yes, it’s short/nasty/brutish versus noble savage.\nIn contrast to the centuries of food fights among philosophers,\ncontemporary Hobbes-versus-Rousseau is about actual data. Some of it\nis archaeological, where researchers have sought to determine the\nprevalence and antiquity of warfare from the archaeological record.\nPredictably, half of each conference on the subject consists of\ndefinitional squabbles. Is “war” solely organized and sustained violence\nbetween groups? Does it require weapons? A standing army (even if\nonly seasonally)? An army with hierarchy and chain of command? If\nfighting is mostly along lines of relatedness, is it a vendetta or clan feud\ninstead of a war?\nFractured Bones\nFor most archaeologists the operational definition has been\nstreamlined to numerous people simultaneously meeting violent deaths.\nIn 1996 the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley of the University of Illinois\nsynthesized the existing literature in his highly influential War Before\nCliché police be damned, you can’t mention this book without calling it\n“monumental.” In this monumental work Pinker argued that (a) violence\nand the worst horrors of inhumanity have been declining for the last half\nmillennium, thanks to the constraining forces of civilization; and (b) the\nwarfare and barbarity preceding that transition are as old as the human\nspecies.\nKeeley and Pinker document savagery galore in prehistoric tribal\nsocieties—mass graves filled with skeletons bearing multiple fractures,\ncaved-in skulls, “parrying” fractures (which arise from raising your arm\nto fend off a blow), stone projectiles embedded in bone. Some sites\nsuggest the outcome of battle—a preponderance of young adult male\nskeletons. Others suggest indiscriminate massacre—butchered skeletons\nof both sexes and all ages. Other sites suggest cannibalism of the\nvanquished.\nIn their separate surveys of the literature, Keeley and Pinker present\nevidence of prestate tribal violence comes from sites in Ukraine, France,\nSweden, Niger, India, and numerous precontact American locations.57\nThis collection of sites includes the oldest such massacre, the 12,000- to\n14,000-year-old Jebel Sahaba site along the Nile in northern Sudan, a\ncemetery of fifty-nine men, women, and children, nearly half of whom\nhave stone projectiles embedded in their bones. And it includes the\nlargest massacre site, the 700-year-old Crow Creek in South Dakota, a\nmass grave of more than four hundred skeletons, with 60 percent\nshowing evidence of violent deaths. Across the twenty-one sites\nsurveyed, about 15 percent of skeletons showed evidence of “death in\nwarfare.” One can, of course, be killed in war in a way that doesn’t leave\nKeeley and Pinker also document how prehistoric settlements\nfrequently protected themselves with defensive palisades and\nfortifications. And, of course, as the poster child for prehistoric violence,\nthere is Otzi, the 5,300-year-old Tyrolean “iceman” found in a melting\nglacier in 1991 on the Italian/Austrian border. In his shoulder was a\nfreshly embedded arrowhead.\nThus, Keeley and Pinker document mass casualties of warfare long\npredating civilization. Just as important, both (starting with Keeley’s\nsubtitle) suggest a hidden agenda among archaeologists to ignore that\nevidence. Why had there been, to use Keeley’s phrase, “pacification of\nthe past”? In chapter 7 we saw how World War II produced a generation\nof social scientists trying to understand the roots of fascism. In Keeley’s\nview, the post–World War II generations of archaeologists recoiled from\nthe trauma of the war by recoiling from the evidence that humans had\nLennon’s “Imagine.”\nKeeley and Pinker generated a strong backlash among many notable\narchaeologists, who charged them with “war-ifying the past.” Most vocal\nhas been R. Brian Ferguson of Rutgers University, with publications with\ntitles like “Pinker’s List: Exaggerating Prehistoric War Mortality.”\nKeeley and Pinker are criticized for numerous reasons:58\na. Some of the sites supposedly presenting evidence for\nwarfare actually contain only a single case of violent\ndeath, suggesting homicide, not war.\nb. The criteria for inferring violent death include skeletons\nin close proximity to arrowheads. However, many such\nartifacts were actually tools used for other purposes, or\nsimply chips and flakes. For example, Fred Wendorf,\nwho excavated Jebel Sahaba, considered most of the\nprojectiles associated with skeletons to have been mere\ndebris.59\nc. Many fractured bones were actually healed. Instead of\nreflecting war, they might indicate the ritualized club\nfighting seen in many tribal societies.\nd. Proving that a human bone was gnawed on by a fellow\nhuman instead of another carnivore is tough. One tour-\nde-force paper demonstrated cannibalism in a Pueblo\nvillage from around the year 1100—human feces there\ncontained the human version of the muscle-specific\nprotein myoglobin.60 In other words, those humans had\nbeen eating human meat. Nonetheless, even when\ncannibalism is clearly documented, it doesn’t indicate\nwhether there was exo- or endocannibalism (i.e., eating\nvanquished enemies versus deceased relatives, as is\ndone in some tribal cultures).\ne. Most important, Keeley and Pinker are accused of\ncherry-picking their data, discussing only sites of\nputative war deaths, rather than the entire literature.*\nwarlike violence. The glee in refuting the broadest\nconclusions of Keeley and Pinker is unmistakable (e.g.,\nFerguson in the previously cited work: “For 10,000\nyears in the Southern Levant, there is not one single\ninstance where it can be said with confidence, ‘war was\nthere.’ [his emphasis] Am I wrong? Name the place.”).\nThus these critics conclude that wars were rare prior to\nhuman civilizations. Supporters of Keeley and Pinker\nretort that you can’t ignore bloodbaths like Crow Creek\nor Jebel Sahaba and that the absence of proof (of early\nwar in so many of these sites) is not proof of absence.\nThis suggests a second strategy for contemporary Hobbes-versus-\nRousseau debates, namely to study contemporary humans in prestate\ntribal societies. How frequently do they war?\nPrehistorians in the Flesh\nWell, if researchers endlessly argue about who or what gnawed on a\nten-thousand-year-old human bone, imagine the disagreements about\nactual living humans.\nKeeley and Pinker, along with Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe\nInstitute, conclude that warfare is nearly universal in contemporary\nnonstate societies. This is the world of headhunters in New Guinea and\nBorneo, Maasai and Zulu warriors in Africa, Amazonians on raiding\nparties in the rain forest. Keeley estimates that, in the absence of\npacification enforced by outside forces such as a government, 90 to 95\npercent of tribal societies engage in warfare, many constantly, and a\nmuch higher percentage are at war at any time than is the case for state\nsocieties. For Keeley the rare peaceful tribal societies are usually so\nbecause they have been defeated and dominated by a neighboring tribe.\nKeeley charges that there has been systematic underreporting of violence\n311\nClockwise, top left: New Guinea, Masai, Amazonian, Zulu\nKeeley also tries to debunk the view that tribal violence is mostly\nritualistic—an arrow in someone’s thigh, a head or two bashed with a\nwar club, and time to call it a day. Instead violence in nonstate cultures is\nlethal. Keeley seems to take pride in this, documenting how various\ncultures use weapons designed for warfare, meant to cause festering\ndamage. He often has an almost testy, offended tone about those\npacifying anthropologists who think indigenous groups lack the\n\ne.g., describing how in the Anglo-Zulu War, Zulu spears were more\naccurate than nineteenth-century British guns, and how the Brits won the\nwar not because they were superior fighters but because their logistical\nsophistication allowed them to fight prolonged wars.\nLike Keeley, Pinker concludes that warfare is nearly ubiquitous in\ntraditional cultures, reporting 10 to 30 percent of deaths as being war\nrelated in New Guinea tribes such as the Gebusi and Mae Enga, and a 35\nto 60 percent range for Waorani and Jivaro tribes in the Amazon. Pinker\nestimates rates of death due to violence. Europe currently is in the range\nof 1 death per 100,000 people per year. During the crime waves of the\n1970s and 1980s, the United States approached 10; Detroit was around\n45. Germany and Russia, during their twentieth-century wars, averaged\n144 and 135, respectively. In contrast, the twenty-seven nonstate\nsocieties surveyed by Pinker average 524 deaths. There are the Grand\nValley Dani of New Guinea, the Piegan Blackfoot of the American Great\nPlains, and the Dinka of Sudan, all of whom in their prime approached\n1,000 deaths, roughly equivalent to losing one acquaintance per year.\nTaking the gold are the Kato, a California tribe that in the 1840s crossed\nthe finish line near 1,500 deaths per 100,000 people per year.\nNo tour of violence in indigenous cultures is complete without the\nYanomamö, a tribe living in the Brazilian and Venezuelan Amazon.\nAccording to dogma, there is almost always raiding between villages; 30\npercent of adult male deaths are due to violence; nearly 70 percent of\nadults have had a close relative killed by violence; 44 percent of men\nhave murdered.61 Fun folks.\nThe Yanomamö are renowned because of Napoleon Chagnon, one of\nthe most famous and controversial anthropologists, a tough, pugnacious,\nno-holds-barred academic brawler who first studied them in the 1960s.\nHe established the Yanomamös’ street cred with his 1967 monograph\nYanomamo: The Fierce People, an anthropology classic. Thanks to his\npublications and his ethnographic films about Yanomamö violence, both\ntheir fierceness and his are well-known tropes in anthropology.*\nA central concept in the next chapter is that evolution is about\npassing copies of your genes into the next generation. In 1988 Chagnon\nThus, among these nonstate tribal cultures standing in for our\nprehistoric past, nearly all have histories of lethal warfare, some virtually\nnonstop, and those who excel at killing are more evolutionarily\nsuccessful. Pretty grim.\nAnd numerous anthropologists object strenuously to every aspect of\nthat picture:62\nAgain with the cherry-picking. In Pinker’s analysis of\nviolence among hunter-horticulturalists and other tribal\ngroups, all but one of his examples come from the\nAmazon or the New Guinea highlands. Global surveys\nyield much lower rates of warfare and violence.\nPinker had foreseen this criticism by playing the Keeley\npacification-of-the-past card, questioning those lower\nrates. In particular he has leveled this charge against the\nanthropologists (whom he somewhat pejoratively calls\n“anthropologists of peace,” somewhat akin to “believers\nin the Easter Bunny”) who have reported on the\nremarkably nonviolent Semai people of Malaysia. This\nproduced a testy letter to Science from this group that, in\naddition to saying that they are “peace anthropologists,”\nnot “anthropologists of peace,”* stated that they are\nobjective scientists who studied the Semai without\npreconceived notions, rather than a gaggle of hippies\n(they even felt obliged to declare that most of them are\nnot pacifists). Pinker’s response was “It is encouraging\nthat ‘anthropologists of peace’ now see their discipline\nas empirical rather than ideological, a welcome change\nfrom the days when many anthropologists signed\nmanifestos on which their position on violence was\n‘correct,’ and censured, shut down, or spread libelous\nrumors about colleagues who disagreed.” Whoof,\naccusing your academic adversaries of signing\nmanifestos is like a sharp knee to the groin.63\ndemolished by the anthropologist Douglas Fry of the\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham, who showed that\nChagnon’s finding is an artifact of poor data analysis:\nChagnon compared the number of descendants of older\nmen who had killed people in battle with those who had\nnot, finding significantly more kids among the former.\nHowever: (a) Chagnon did not control for age\ndifferences—the killers happened to be an average of\nmore than a decade older than the nonkillers, meaning\nmore than a decade more time to accumulate\ndescendants. (b) More important, this was the wrong\nanalysis to answer the question posed—the issue isn’t\nthe reproductive success of elderly men who had been\nkillers in their youth. You need to consider the\nreproductive success of all killers, including the many\nwho were themselves killed as young warriors, distinctly\ncurtailing their reproductive success. Not doing so is\nlike concluding that war is not lethal, based solely on\nstudies of war veterans.\nMoreover, Chagnon’s finding does not generalize—at\nleast three studies of other cultures fail to find a\nviolence/reproductive success link. For example, a study\nby Luke Glowacki and Richard Wrangham of Harvard\nexamined a nomadic pastoralist tribe, the Nyangatom of\nsouthern Ethiopia. Like other pastoralists in their region,\nthe Nyangatom regularly raid one another for cattle.65\nThe authors found that frequent participation in large,\nopen battle raiding did not predict increased lifelong\nreproductive success. Instead such success was\npredicted by frequent participation in “stealth raiding,”\nwhere a small group furtively steals cows from the\nenemy at night. In other words, in this culture being a\nwarrior on ’roids does not predict amply passing on your\nweapons more lethal than those of prehistory (a damning\ncriticism of Chagnon is that he often traded axes,\nmachetes, and shotguns to Yanomamö for their\ncooperation in his studies). For another, these groups\noften live in degraded habitats that increase resource\ncompetition, thanks to being increasingly hemmed in by\nthe outside world. And outside contact can be\ncatastrophic. Pinker cites research showing high rates of\nviolence among the Amazonian Aché and Hiwi tribes.\nHowever, in examining the original reports, Fry found\nthat all of the Aché and Hiwi deaths were due to killings\nby frontier ranchers intent on forcing them off their\nland.66 This tells nothing about our prehistoric past.\nBoth sides in these debates see much at stake. Near the end of his\nbook, Keeley airs a pretty weird worry: “The doctrines of the pacified\npast unequivocally imply that the only answer to the ‘mighty scourge of\nwar’ is a return to tribal conditions and the destruction of all\ncivilization.” In other words, unless this tomfoolery of archaeologists\npacifying the past stops, people will throw away their antibiotics and\nmicrowaves, do some scarification rituals, and switch to loincloths—and\nwhere will that leave us?\nCritics on the other side of these debates have deeper worries. For\none thing, the false picture of, say, Amazonian tribes as ceaselessly\nviolent has been used to justify stealing their land. According to Stephen\nCorry of Survival International, a human-rights organization that\nadvocates for indigenous tribal peoples, “Pinker is promoting a fictitious,\ncolonialist image of a backward ‘Brutal Savage’, which pushes the\ndebate back over a century and is still used to destroy tribes.”67\n—\nAmid these roiling debates, let’s keep sight of what got us to this point.\nA behavior has occurred that is good, bad, or ambiguous. How have\ncultural factors stretching back to the origins of humans contributed to\nsubjects are pastoralists, agriculturalists, or horticulturalists, lifestyles\nthat emerged only in the last ten thousand to fourteen thousand years,\nafter the domestication of plants and animals. In the context of hominin\nhistory stretching back hundreds of thousands of years, being a camel\nherder or farmer is nearly as newfangled as being a lobbyist advocating\nfor legal rights for robots. For most of history, humans have been hunter-\ngatherers, a whole different kettle of fish.\nWar and Hunter-Gatherers, Past and Present\nRoughly 95 to 99 percent of hominin history has been spent in small,\nnomadic bands that foraged for edible plants and hunted cooperatively.\nWhat is known about hunter-gatherer (for sanity’s sake, henceforth HG)\nviolence?\nGiven that prehistoric HGs didn’t have lots of material possessions\nthat have lasted tens of thousands of years, they haven’t left much of an\narchaeological record. Insight into their minds and lifestyle comes from\ncave paintings dating back as much as forty thousand years. Though\npaintings from around the world show humans hunting, hardly any\nunambiguously depict interhuman violence.\nThe paleontological record is even sparser. To date, there has been\ndiscovered one site of an HG massacre, dating back ten thousand years\nin northern Kenya; this will be discussed later.\nWhat to do with this void of information? One approach is\ncomparative, inferring the nature of our distant ancestors by comparing\nthem with extant nonhuman primates. Early versions of this approach\nwere the writings of Konrad Lorenz and of Robert Ardrey, who argued in\nhis 1966 best seller The Territorial Imperative that human origins are\nrooted in violent territoriality.68 The most influential modern incarnation\ncomes from Richard Wrangham, particularly in his 1997 book (with Dale\nPeterson) Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence. For\nWrangham chimps provide the clearest guide to the behavior of earliest\nhumans, and the picture is a bloody one. He essentially leapfrogs HGs\nentirely: “So we come back to the Yanomamo. Do they suggest to us that\ncollective imagination and authorized the creation of primitive\nEdens for some, forgotten matriarchies for others. It is good to\ndream, but a sober, waking rationality suggests that if we start\nwith ancestors like chimpanzees and end up with modern humans\nbuilding walls and fighting platforms, the 5-million-year-long\ntrail to our modern selves was lined, along its full stretch, by a\nmale aggression that structured our ancestors’ social lives and\ntechnology and minds.\nIt’s Hobbes all the way down, plus Keeley-esque contempt for\npacification-of-the-past dreamers.\nThis view has been strongly criticized: (a) We’re neither chimps nor\ntheir descendants; they’ve been evolving at nearly the same pace as\nhumans since our ancestral split. (b) Wrangham picks and chooses in his\ncross-species linkages; for example, he argues that the human\nevolutionary legacy of violence is rooted not only in our close\nrelationship to chimps but also in our nearly-as-close kinship with\ngorillas, who practice competitive infanticide. The problem is that,\noverall, gorillas display minimal aggression, something Wrangham\nignores in linking human violence to gorillas. (c) As the most significant\nspecies cherry-picking, Wrangham pretty much ignores bonobos, with\ntheir far lower levels of violence than chimps, female social dominance,\nand absence of hostile territoriality. Crucially, humans share as much of\ntheir genes with bonobos as with chimps, something unknown when\nDemonic Males was published (and, notably, Wrangham has since\nsoftened his views).\nFor most in the field, most insights into the behavior of our HG\nancestors come from study of contemporary HGs.\nOnce, the world of humans consisted of nothing but HGs; today the\nremnants of that world are in the few remaining pockets of peoples who\nlive pure HG lives. These include the Hadza of northern Tanzania, Mbuti\n“Pygmies” in the Congo, Batwa in Rwanda, Gunwinggu of the\nAustralian outback, Andaman Islanders in India, Batak in the\nthe majority of calories come from foraging; men spend lots of time\ntalking about how awesome they were in the last hunt and how much\nawesomer they’ll be in the next—among some Hadza, maternal\ngrandmothers supply more calories to families than do the Man the\nHunter men.69\nThe arc of human history is readily equated with an arc of progress,\nand key to the latter is the view that agriculture was the best thing\nhumans ever invented; I’ll rant about that later. A cornerstone of the\nagriculture lobby is the idea that primordial HGs were half starved. In\nreality, HGs typically work fewer hours for their daily bread than do\nHGs.70 Dogma used to be that HG bands had fairly stable group\nmembership, producing considerable in-group relatedness. More recent\nwork suggests less relatedness than thought, reflecting fluid\nfusion/fission groupings in nomadic HGs. The Hadza show one\nconsequence of such fluidity, namely that particularly cooperative\nhunters find one another and work together. More on this in the next\nchapter.\nWhat about our best and worst behaviors in contemporary HGs? Up\ninto the 1970s, the clear answer was that HGs are peaceful, cooperative,\nneighboring band, just hunt in a different valley from them).\nThe standard-bearers for HG grooviness were the Kalahari !Kung.*71\nThe title of an early monograph about them—Elizabeth Marshall\nThomas’s 1959 The Harmless People—says it all.* !Kung are to the\nYanomamö as Joan Baez is to Sid Vicious and the Sex Pistols.\nNaturally, this picture of the !Kung in particular and HGs in general\nwas ripe for revisionism. This occurred when field studies were\nsufficiently long term to document HGs killing one another, as\nsummarized in an influential 1978 publication by Carol Ember of Yale.72\nBasically, if you’re observing a band of thirty people, it will take a long\ntime to see that, on a per-capita basis, they have murder rates\napproximating Detroit’s (the standard comparison always made).\nAdmitting that HGs were violent was seen as a purging of sixties\nanthropological romanticism, a bracing slap in the face for\nanthropologists who had jettisoned objectivity in order to dance with\nwolves.\nBy the time of Pinker’s synthesis, HG violence was established, and\nthe percentage of their deaths attributed to warfare averaged around 15\npercent, way more than in modern Western societies. Contemporary HG\n321\nKalahari !Kung hunter-gatherers\nTime for the criticisms:73\nMislabeling—some HGs cited by Pinker, Keeley, and\nBowles are, in fact, hunter-horticulturalists.\n\nSome violent Great Plains HG cultures were\nuntraditional in the sense of using something crucial that\ndidn’t exist in the Pleistocene—domesticated horses\nridden into battle.\nLike non-Western agriculturalists or pastoralists,\ncontemporary HG are not equivalent to our ancestors.\nWeapons invented in the last ten thousand years have\nbeen introduced through trade; most HG cultures have\nspent millennia being displaced by agriculturalists and\npastoralists, pushed into ever tougher, resource-sparse\necosystems.\nOnce again, the cherry-picking issue, i.e., failure to cite\ncases of peaceful HGs.\nMost crucially, there’s more than one type of HG.\nNomadic HGs are the original brand, stretching back\nhundreds of thousands of years.74 But in addition to HG\n2.0 equestrians, there are “complex HGs,” who are\ndifferent—violent, not particularly egalitarian, and\nsedentary, typically because they’re sitting on a rich\nfood source that they defend from outsiders. In other\nwords, a transitional form from pure HGs. And many of\nthe cultures cited by Ember, Keeley, and Pinker are\ncomplex HGs. This difference is relevant to Nataruk,\nthat northern Kenyan site of a ten-thousand-year-old\nmassacre—skeletons of twenty-seven unburied people,\nkilled by clubbing, stabbing, or stone projectiles. The\nvictims were sedentary HGs, living alongside a shallow\nbay on Lake Turkana, prime beachfront property with\neasy fishing and plentiful game animals coming to the\nwater to drink. Just the sort of real estate that someone\nelse would try to muscle in on.\nThe most thoughtful and insightful analyses of HG violence come\nVisit bit.ly/2oeg96t for a larger version of this graph.\nFry has provided what I consider the cleanest assessment of warfare\nin such cultures. In a notable 2013 Science paper, he and Finnish\nanthropologist Patrik Söderberg reviewed all cases of lethal violence in\nthe ethnographic literature in “pure” nomadic HGs (i.e., well studied\nbefore extensive contact with outsiders and living in a stable ecosystem).\nThe sample consisted of twenty-one such groups from around the world.\nFry and Söderberg observed what might be called warfare (defined by\nthe fairly unstringent criterion of conflict producing multiple casualties)\ncauses?\nIn his 2012 book Moral Origins: The Evolution of Virtue, Altruism,\nand Shame, Boehm also surveys the literature, using slightly less\nstringent criteria than Fry uses, producing a list of about fifty relatively\n“pure” nomadic HG cultures (heavily skewed toward Inuit groups from\nthe Arctic).75 As expected, violence is mostly committed by men. Most\ncommon is killing related to women—two men fighting over a particular\nwoman, or attempts to kidnap a woman from a neighboring group.\nNaturally, there are men killing their wives, usually over accusations of\nadultery. There’s female infanticide and killing arising from accusations\nof witchcraft. There are occasional killings over garden-variety stealing\nof food or refusals to share food. And lots of revenge killings by relatives\nof someone killed.\nBoth Fry and Boehm report killings akin to capital punishment for\nsevere norm violations. What norms do nomadic HGs value most?\nFairness, indirect reciprocity, and avoidance of despotism.\nFairness. As noted, HGs pioneered human cooperative hunting and\nsharing among nonrelatives.76 This is most striking with meat. It’s\ntypically shared by successful hunters with unsuccessful ones (and their\nfamilies); individuals playing dominant roles in hunts don’t necessarily\nget much more meat than everyone else; crucially, the most successful\nhunter rarely decides how the meat is divided—instead this is typically\ndone by a third party. There are fascinating hints about the antiquity of\nthis. Big-game hunting by hominins 400,000 years ago has been\ndocumented; bones from animals butchered then show cut marks that are\nchaotic, overlapping at different angles, suggesting a free-for-all. But by\n200,000 years ago the contemporary HG pattern is there—cut marks are\nevenly spaced and parallel, suggesting that single individuals butchered\nand dispensed the meat.\nThis does not mean, though, that sharing is effortless for pure HGs.\nBoehm notes how, for example, the !Kung perpetually kvetch about\nbeing shortchanged on meat. It’s the background hum of social\nregulation.\nIndirect reciprocity. The next chapter discusses reciprocal altruism\nstabilizing cooperation is ideal for big-game hunters, where two rules\nhold: (a) your hunts are usually unsuccessful; and (b) when they are\nsuccessful, you typically have more meat than your family can consume,\nso you might as well share it around. As has been said, an HG’s best\ninvestment against future hunger is to put meat in other people’s\nstomachs now.\nAvoidance of despotism. As also covered in the next chapter, there’s\nconsiderable evolutionary pressure for detecting cheating (when\nsomeone reneges on their half of a reciprocal relationship). For nomadic\nHGs, policing covert cheating is less of a concern than overt evidence of\nintimidation and powermongering. HGs are constantly on guard against\nbullies throwing their weight around.\nHG societies expend lots of collective effort on enforcing fairness,\nindirect reciprocity, and avoidance of despotism. This is accomplished\nwith that terrific norm-enforcement mechanism, gossip. HGs gossip\nendlessly, and as studied by Polly Wiessner of the University of Utah,\nit’s mostly about the usual: norm violation by high-status individuals.77\nPeople magazine around the campfire.* Gossiping serves numerous\npurposes. It helps for reality testing (“Is it just me, or was he being a\ntotal jerk?”), passing news (“Two guesses who just happened to get a\nfoot cramp during the hairiest part of the hunt today”), and building\nconsensus (“Something needs to be done about this guy”). Gossip is the\nweapon of norm enforcement.\nHG cultures take similar actions—collectively subjecting miscreants\nto criticism, shaming and mockery, ostracizing and shunning, refusing to\nshare meat, nonlethal physical punishment, expulsion from the group, or,\nas a last resort, killing the person (done either by the whole group or by a\ndesignated executioner).\nBoehm documents such judicial killings in nearly half the pure HG\ncultures. What transgressions merit them? Murder, attempts at grabbing\npower, use of malicious sorcery, stealing, refusal to share, betrayal of the\ngroup to outsiders, and of course breaking of sexual taboos. All typically\ndistinctions: (a) HGs versus other traditional ways of making a living;\n(b) nomadic HGs versus sedentary ones; (c) data sets that canvass an\nentire literature versus those that concentrate on extreme examples; (d)\nmembers of traditional societies killing one another versus members\nbeing killed by gun-toting, land-grabbing outsiders; (e) chimps as our\ncousins versus chimps erroneously viewed as our ancestors; (f) chimps\nas our closest ancestors versus chimps and bonobos as our closest\nancestors; (g) warfare versus homicide, where lots of the former can\ndecrease the latter in the name of in-group cooperation; (h) contemporary\nHGs living in stable, resource-filled habitats with minimal interactions\nwith the outside world versus contemporary HGs pushed into marginal\nhabitats and interacting with non-HGs. Once you’ve done that, I think a\npretty clear answer emerges. The HGs who peopled earth for hundreds of\nthousands of years were probably no angels, being perfectly capable of\nmurder. However, “war”—both in the sense that haunts our modern\nworld and in the stripped-down sense that haunted our ancestors—seems\nto have been rare until most humans abandoned the nomadic HG\nlifestyle. Our history as a species has not been soaked in escalated\nconflict. And ironically Keeley tacitly concludes the same—he estimates\nthat 90 to 95 percent of societies engage in war. And whom does he note\nas the exceptions? Nomadic HGs.\nWhich brings us to agriculture. I won’t pull any punches—I think\nthat its invention was one of the all-time human blunders, up there with,\nsay, the New Coke debacle and the Edsel. Agriculture makes people\ndependent on a few domesticated crops and animals instead of hundreds\nof wild food sources, creating vulnerability to droughts and blights and\nzoonotic diseases. Agriculture makes for sedentary living, leading\nhumans to do something that no primate with a concern for hygiene and\npublic health would ever do, namely living in close proximity to their\nfeces. Agriculture makes for surplus and thus almost inevitably the\nunequal distribution of surplus, generating socioeconomic status\ndifferences that dwarf anything that other primates cook up with their\nhierarchies. And from there it’s just a hop, skip, and a jump until we’ve\n327\nMaybe this is a bit over the top. Nonetheless, I do think it is\nreasonably clear that it wasn’t until humans began the massive\ntransformation of life that came from domesticating teosinte and wild\ntubers, aurochs and einkorn, and of course wolves, that it became\npossible to let loose the dogs of war.\n\nhe first half of the chapter explored where we are; the second, how\nwe most likely got here.\n“Where we are” is awash in cultural variation. From our biological\nperspective, the most fascinating point is how brains shape cultures,\nwhich shape brains, which shape . . . That’s why it’s called coevolution.\nWe’ve seen some evidence of coevolution in the technical sense—where\nthere are significant differences between different cultures in the\ndistribution of gene variants pertinent to behavior. But those influences\nare pretty small. Instead what is most consequential is childhood, the\ntime when cultures inculcate individuals into further propagating their\nculture. In that regard, probably the most important fact about genetics\nand culture is the delayed maturation of the frontal cortex—the genetic\nprogramming for the young frontal cortex to be freer from genes than\nother brain regions, to be sculpted instead by environment, to sop up\ncultural norms. To hark back to a theme from the first pages of this book,\nit doesn’t take a particularly fancy brain to learn how to motorically, say,\nthrow a punch. But it takes a fancy, environmentally malleable frontal\ncortex to learn culture-specific rules about when it’s okay to throw\npunches.\nIn another theme from the first half, cultural differences manifest\nthemselves in monumentally important, expected ways—say, whom it is\nokay to kill (an enemy soldier, a cheating spouse, a newborn of the\n“wrong” sex, an elderly parent too old to hunt, a teenage daughter who is\nabsorbing the culture around her rather than the culture her parents\ndeparted). But the manifestations can occur in unlikely places—e.g.,\nwhere your eyes look within milliseconds of seeing a picture, or whether\nthinking of a rabbit prompts you to think of other animals or of what\nrabbits eat.\nAnother key theme is the paradoxical influence of ecology.\nEcosystems majorly shape culture—but then that culture can be exported\n329\nabout the nature of birth and death and everything in between and\nthereafter from preliterate Middle Eastern pastoralists.\nThe second half of the chapter, just concluded, addresses the key\nissue of how we got here—has it been hundreds of thousands of years of\nHobbes or of Rousseau? Your answer to that question greatly shapes\nwhat you’ll make of something we’ll consider in the final chapter,\nnamely that over the last half millennium people have arguably gotten a\nlot less awful to one another."

    "content": "The Evolution of\nBehavior\nt last we reach the foundations. Genes and promoters evolve. As\ndo transcription factors, transposases, and splicing enzymes. As\nhas every trait touched by genetic influences (i.e., everything). In the\nvolution rests on three steps: (a) certain biological traits are\ninherited by genetic means; (b) mutations and gene recombination\nproduce variation in those traits; (c) some of those variants confer more\n“fitness” than others. Given those conditions, over time the frequency of\nmore “fit” gene variants increases in a population.\nWe start by trashing some common misconceptions.\nFirst, that evolution favors survival of the fittest. Instead evolution is\nabout reproduction, passing on copies of genes. An organism living\ncenturies but not reproducing is evolutionarily invisible.* The difference\nbetween survival and reproduction is shown with “antagonistic\npleiotropy,” referring to traits that increase reproductive fitness early in\nlife yet decrease life span. For example, primates’ prostates have high\nmetabolic rates, enhancing sperm motility. Upside: enhanced fertility;\ndownside: increased risk of prostate cancer. Antagonistic pleiotropy\noccurs dramatically in salmon, who epically journey to their spawning\ngrounds to reproduce and then die. If evolution were about survival\nrather than passing on copies of genes, there’d be no antagonistic\npleiotropy.2\nAnother misconception is that evolution can select for preadaptations\n—neutral traits that prove useful in the future. This doesn’t happen;\nselection is for traits pertinent to the present. Related to this is the\nmisconception that living species are somehow better adapted than\nextinct species. Instead, the latter were just as well adapted, until\nenvironmental conditions changed sufficiently to do them in; the same\nawaits us. Finally, there’s the misconception that evolution directionally\nselects for greater complexity. Yes, if once there were only single-celled\norganisms and there are multicellular ones now, average complexity has\nincreased. Nonetheless, evolution doesn’t necessarily select for greater\ncomplexity—just consider bacteria decimating humans with some\nplague.\nThe final misconception is that evolution is “just a theory.” I will\nincludes:\nNumerous examples where changing selective pressures\nhave changed gene frequencies in populations within\ngenerations (e.g., bacteria evolving antibiotic\nresistance). Moreover, there are also examples (mostly\ninsects, given their short generation times) of a species\nin the process of splitting into two.\nVoluminous fossil evidence of intermediate forms in\nnumerous taxonomic lineages.\nMolecular evidence. We share ~98 percent of our genes\nwith the other apes, ~96 percent with monkeys, ~75\npercent with dogs, ~20 percent with fruit flies. This\nindicates that our last common ancestor with other apes\nlived more recently than our last common ancestor with\nmonkeys, and so on.\nGeographic evidence. To use Richard Dawkins’s\nsuggestion for dealing with a fundamentalist insisting\nthat all species emerged in their current forms from\nNoah’s ark—how come all thirty-seven species of\nlemurs that made landfall on Mt. Ararat in the Armenian\nhighlands hiked over to Madagascar, none dying and\nleaving fossils in transit?\nUnintelligent design—oddities explained only by\nevolution. Why do whales and dolphins have vestigial\nleg bones? Because they descend from a four-legged\nterrestrial mammal. Why should we have arrector pili\nmuscles in our skin that produce thoroughly useless\ngooseflesh? Because of our recent speciation from other\napes whose arrector pili muscles were attached to hair,\nand whose hair stands up during emotional arousal.\n“natural selection” for traits that enhance the passing on of copies of\ngenes through any other route—e.g., good health, foraging skills,\npredator avoidance.\nThe two processes can work in opposition.3 For example, among\nwild sheep one gene influences the size of horns in males. One variant\nproduces large horns, improving social dominance, a plus for sexual\nselection. The other produces small horns, which are metabolically\ncheaper, allowing males to live and mate (albeit at low rates) longer.\nWhich wins—transient but major reproductive success, or persistent but\nminor success? An intermediate form.* Or consider male peacocks\npaying a price, in terms of natural selection, for their garish plumage—it\ncosts a fortune metabolically to grow, restricts mobility, and is\nconspicuous to predators. But it sure boosts fitness via sexual selection.\nImportantly, neither type of selection necessarily selects for “the”\nmost adaptive version of a trait, which replaces all others. There can be\nfrequency-dependent selection, where the rarer version of two traits is\nEVOLUTION\nrganisms are amazingly well adapted. A desert rodent has kidneys\nthat excel at retaining water; a giraffe’s huge heart can pump blood\nup to its brain; elephants’ leg bones are strong enough to support an\nelephant. Well, yes—it has to work that way: desert rodents whose\nkidneys weren’t great at retaining water didn’t pass on copies of their\ngenes. Thus there is a logic to evolution, where natural selection sculpts\ntraits into adaptiveness.\nImportantly, natural selection works not only on anatomy and\nphysiology but on behavior as well—in other words, behavior evolves,\ncan be optimized by selection into being adaptive.\nVarious branches of biology focus on the evolution of behavior.\nProbably best known is sociobiology, premised on social behavior being\nsculpted by evolution to be optimized, just as biomechanical\noptimization sculpts the size of a giraffe’s heart.4 Sociobiology emerged\nin the 1970s, eventually generating the offshoot evolutionary psychology\n—the study of the evolutionary optimization of psychological traits; as\nwe’ll see, both have been plenty controversial. As a simplifying\ne start by grappling with an entrenched misconception about the\nevolution of behavior. This is because Americans were taught\nabout the subject in the 1960s by Marlin Perkins on the TV program\nMutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom.\nIt was great. Perkins would host. Jim, his sidekick, did dangerous\nthings with snakes. And there were always seamless segues from the\nprogram to ads from Mutual of Omaha—“Just as lions mate for hours,\nyou’ll want fire insurance for your home.”\nUnfortunately, Perkins espoused wildly wrong evolutionary thinking.\nHere’s how it looked on the program: It’s dawn on the savanna; there’s a\nherd of wildebeest on a river’s edge. The grass is greener on the other\nside, and everyone wants some, but the river teems with predatory\ncrocodiles. The wildebeest are hemming and hawing in agitation when\nsuddenly an elderly wildebeest pushes to the front, says, “I sacrifice\nmyself for you, my children,” and leaps in. And while the crocs are busy\nwith him, the other wildebeest cross the river.\nWhy would the old wildebeest do that? Marlin Perkins would answer\nwith patrician authority: because animals behave For the Good of the\nSpecies.\nYes, behavior evolves by “group selection” for the good of the\nspecies. This idea was championed in the early 1960s by V. C. Wynne-\nEdwards, whose wrongness made him modern evolutionary biology’s\nLamarck.*5\nAnimals don’t behave for the good of the species. But what about\nthat wildebeest? Look closely and you’ll see what really happens. Why\ndid he wind up saving the day? Because he was old and weak. “Good of\nthe species” my keister. They pushed the old guy in.\nGroup selection was done in by theoretical and empirical studies\nshowing patterns of behavior incompatible with it. Key work was done\nby two gods of evolutionary biology, George Williams of SUNY Stony\nBrook and Oxford’s Bill (“W.D.”) Hamilton.6 Consider “eusocial\nworker ants forgo reproduction is like asking why your nose cells forgo\nreproduction. In other words, eusocial insects constitute a unique type of\n“group.” Williams then elaborated on how the more standard genetic\nsystem, in species from noneusocial insects to us, was incompatible with\ngroup selection. Animals don’t behave for the good of the species. They\nbehave to maximize the number of copies of their genes passed into the\nnext generation.*\nThis is the cornerstone of sociobiology and was summarized in\nassing on lots of copies of one’s genes is accomplished most\ndirectly by maximizing reproduction. This is summarized by the\naphorism “A chicken is an egg’s way of making another egg”—behavior\nis just an epiphenomenon, a means of getting copies of genes into the\nnext generation.\nIndividual selection fares better than group selection in explaining\nbasic behaviors. A hyena bears down on some zebras. What would the\nnearest one do if she’s a group selectionist? Stand there, sacrificing\nherself for the group. In contrast, an individual selectionist zebra would\nrun like hell. Zebras run like hell. Or consider hyenas that have just\nkilled a zebra. Group selection mind-set—everyone calmly takes turns\neating. Individual selection—frenzied free-for-all. Which is what occurs.\nBut wait, says the group selectionist, wouldn’t the zebra species\nbenefit if it is the fastest animals who survive and pass on those fast-\nrunning genes? Ditto for the group benefits of the fiercest hyena getting\nthe most food.\nAs more nuances of behavior are observed, clinging to group\nselection requires increasingly tortuous arguments. But one single\nobservation devastates group selection.\nIn 1977 the Harvard primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy documented\nsomething remarkable—langur monkeys in the Mount Abu region of\nIndia kill one another.7 People already knew that some male primates kill\none another, fighting for dominance—okay, makes sense, boys will be\nboys. But that’s not what Hrdy reported; male langurs were killing\ninfants.\nOnce people believed her careful documentation, there was an easy\nanswer—since babies are cute and inhibit aggression, something\npathological must be happening.8 Maybe the Abu langur population\ndensity was too high and everyone was starving, or male aggression was\noverflowing, or infanticidal males were zombies. Something certifiably\nabnormal.\nHere’s his new domain, consisting of females with the babies of the\nprevious male. And crucially, the average tenure of a breeding male\n(about twenty-seven months) is shorter than the average interbirth\ninterval. No females are ovulating, because they’re nursing infants; thus\nthis new stud will be booted out himself before any females wean their\nkids and resume ovulating. All for nothing, none of his genes passed on.\nWhat, logically, should he do? Kill the infants. This decreases the\nreproductive success of the previous male and, thanks to the females\nceasing to nurse, they start ovulating.*\nThat’s the male perspective. What about the females? They’re also\ninto maximizing copies of genes passed on. They fight the new male,\nprotecting their infants. Females have also evolved the strategy of going\ninto “pseudoestrus”—falsely appearing to be in heat. They mate with the\nmale. And since males know squat about female langur biology, they fall\nfor it—“Hey, I mated with her this morning and now she’s got an infant;\nI am one major stud.” They’ll often cease their infanticidal attacks.\nDespite initial skepticism, competitive infanticide has been\ndocumented in similar circumstances in 119 species, including lions,\nhippos, and chimps.9\nA variant occurs in hamsters; because males are nomadic, any infant\na male encounters is unlikely to be his, and thus he attempts to kill it\n(remember that rule about never putting a pet male hamster in a cage\nwith babies?). Another version occurs among wild horses and gelada\nbaboons; a new male harasses pregnant females into miscarrying. Or\nsuppose you’re a pregnant mouse and a new, infanticidal male has\narrived. Once you give birth, your infants will be killed, wasting all the\nenergy of pregnancy. Logical response? Cut your losses with the “Bruce\neffect,” where pregnant females miscarry if they smell a new male.10\nThus competitive infanticide occurs in numerous species (including\namong female chimps, who sometimes kill infants of unrelated\nfemales).11 None of this makes sense outside of gene-based individual\nselection.\nIndividual selection is shown with heartbreaking clarity by mountain\ngorillas, my favorite primate.12 They’re highly endangered, hanging on\n339\nthousand gorillas left, because of habitat degradation, disease caught\nfrom nearby humans, poaching, and spasms of warfare rolling across\nthose borders. And also because mountain gorillas practice competitive\ninfanticide. Logical for an individual intent on maximizing the copies of\nhis genes in the next generation, but simultaneously pushing these\nwondrous animals toward extinction. This isn’t behaving for the good of\nthe species.\n\no understand the next foundational concept, reflect on what it\nmeans to be related to someone and to pass on copies of “your”\ngenes.\nSuppose you have an identical twin, with the same genome as you.\nAs a startling, irrefutable fact, in terms of the genes being passed on to\nthe next generation, it doesn’t matter if you reproduce or sacrifice\nyourself so that your twin reproduces.\nWhat about a full sibling who isn’t an identical twin? Recall from\nchapter 8 that you’d share 50 percent of your genes with him.* Thus\nreproducing once and dying so that he reproduces twice are\nevolutionarily identical. Half sibling, 25 percent of genes in common,\ncalculate accordingly. . . .\nThe geneticist J. B. S. Haldane, who, when asked if he’d sacrifice his\nlife for a brother, is credited to have quipped, “I’ll gladly lay down my\nlife for two brothers or eight cousins.” You can leave copies of your\ngenes in the next generation by reproducing, but also by helping relatives\nreproduce, especially closer relatives. Hamilton formalized this with an\nequation factoring in the costs and benefits of helping someone,\nweighted by their degree of relatedness to you. This is the essence of kin\nselection.* This explains the crucial fact that in countless species, whom\nyou cooperate with, compete with, or mate with depends on their degree\nof relatedness to you.\nMammals first encounter kin selection soon after birth, reflecting\nsomething monumentally obvious: females rarely nurse someone else’s\ninfants. Next, among numerous primates the mother of a newborn and an\nadolescent female may commence a relationship fraught with pluses and\nminuses—the mother occasionally lets the adolescent care for her\noffspring. For the mother the plus is getting time to forage without baby\non board; the minus is that the babysitter may be incompetent. For the\nadolescent the plus is getting mothering experience; the minus, the effort\nAn extension of allomothering is the cooperative breeding of New\nWorld monkeys like marmosets. In their social groups only one female\nbreeds, while the others—typically younger relatives—help with child\ncare.14\nThe extent to which a male primate cares for infants reflects his\ncertainty of paternity.15 Among marmosets, who form stable pair-bonds,\nmales do most of the child care. In contrast, among baboons, where a\nfemale mates with multiple males during her estrus cycle, it’s only the\nlikely fathers (i.e., males who mated on the female’s most fertile day,\nwhen she had her most conspicuous estrus swelling) who invest in the\nwell-being of the child, aiding him in a fight.*\nAmong many primates, how often you groom someone depends on\nhow closely related they are to you. Among baboons, females spend their\nwhole life in their natal troop (whereas males migrate to a new troop at\npuberty); as a result, adult females have complex cooperative kinship\nrelations and inherit their dominance rank from their mother. Among\nchimps it’s the opposite; females leave home at puberty, and kin-based\nadult cooperation occurs only among males (for example, where groups\nof related males attack solitary males from neighboring groups). And\namong langurs, when a female defends her infant against a new male,\nshe most often is helped by elderly female relatives.\nMoreover, primates understand kinship. Dorothy Cheney and Robert\nSeyfarth of the University of Pennsylvania, studying wild vervet\nmonkeys, have shown that if animal A is crummy to animal B,\nafterward, B is more likely to be crummy to A’s relatives. And if A is\nlousy to B, B’s relatives are more likely to be crummy to A.\nFurthermore, if A is lousy to B, B’s relatives are more likely to be\ncrummy to A’s relatives.16\nIn beautiful “playback” experiments, Cheney and Seyfarth first\nrecorded vocalizations from each vervet in a group. They’d place a\nspeaker in some bushes, and when everyone was sitting around, they’d\nplay a recording of some kid giving a distress call. And the females\nwould all look at the kid’s mother—“Hey, that’s Madge’s kid. What’s she\ngoing to do?” (Note that this also shows that monkeys recognize voices.)\nother random females fighting.17 If a female’s relative was involved in\nthe fighting, she’d look toward the speaker longer than if there were no\nrelatives involved. And if it was relatives of the two females fighting\neach other, the higher-ranking one would remind the subordinate of her\nplace by supplanting her from her spot.\nAnother playback study created some baboon virtual reality.18\nBaboon A dominates baboon B. Thanks to cutting and splicing of\nrecordings of vocalizations, baboon A is heard making a dominance\nvocalization, B making a subordination one. When this happens, no\nbaboons looked at the bushes—A > B, boring status quo. But if baboon\nA is heard making a subordination vocalization after B makes a\ndominance one—a rank reversal—everyone orients to the bushes (“Did\nyou hear what I just heard?”). Then a third scenario—a dominance\nreversal between two members of the same family. And no one looks,\nbecause it’s uninteresting. (“Families, they’re crazy. You should see mine\n—we have these huge dominance reversals and are hugging an hour\nlater.”) Baboons “classify others simultaneously according to both\nindividual rank and kinship.”\nThus other primates contemplate kinship with remarkable\nsophistication, with kinship determining patterns of cooperation and\ncompetition.\nNonprimates are also into kin selection. Consider this—sperm in a\nfemale’s vaginal tract can aggregate, allowing them to swim faster.\nAmong a deer mouse species where females mate with multiple males,\nsperm aggregate only with sperm from the same individual or a close\nrelative.19\nAs behavioral examples, squirrels and prairie dogs give alarm\nvocalizations when spotting a predator. It’s risky, calling attention to the\ncaller, and such altruism is more common when in the proximity of\nrelatives. Social groups built around female relatives occur in numerous\nspecies (e.g., lion prides, where related females nurse one another’s\ncubs). Moreover, while prides typically contain a single breeding male,\non those occasions when it’s two males, better than chance that they’re\nbrothers. There is a striking similarity in humans. Most cultures have\nstrapping young man to his infant brother.*20\n—\nA challenging implication of kin selection arises.\nThose hot cousins. If one accrues fitness benefits by helping relatives\npass on copies of their genes, why not help them do that by mating with\nthem? Yech; inbreeding produces decreased fertility and those genetic\nunpleasantnesses in European royalty.*21 So the dangers of inbreeding\ncounter the kin-selection advantages. Theoretical models suggest that the\noptimal balance is third-cousin matings. And indeed, numerous species\nprefer to mate with between a first and a third cousin.22\nThis occurs in insects, lizards, and fish, where, on top of that, cousin-\nmating pairs invest more in the rearing of their offspring than do\nunrelated parents. A preference for cousin matings occurs in quail,\nfrigate birds, and zebra finches, while among pair-bonded barn swallows\nand ground tits, females sneak out on their partner to mate with cousins.\nSimilar preferences occur in some rodents (including the Malagasy giant\njumping rat, a species that sounds disturbing even without cousins\nshacking up with each other).23\nAnd what about humans? Something similar. Women prefer the smell\nof moderately related over unrelated men. And in a study of 160 years of\ndata concerning every couple in Iceland (which is a mecca for human\ngeneticists, given its genetic and socioeconomic homogeneity), the\nhighest reproductive success arose from third- and fourth-cousin\nmarriages.24\nRecognizing Relatives?\nThese findings concerning kin selection require animals to recognize\ndegrees of relatedness. How do they do this?\nSome species have innate recognition. For example, place a mouse in\nan arena; at one end is an unrelated female, at the other, a full sister from\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC). This is a super variable gene cluster\nthat produces unique proteins that form a signature for an individual.\nThis was first studied by immunologists. What does the immune system\ndo? It differentiates between you and invaders—“self” and “nonself”—\nand attacks the latter. All your cells carry your unique MHC-derived\nprotein, and surveillance immune cells attack any cell lacking this\nprotein password. And MHC-derived proteins also wind up in\npheromones, producing a distinctive olfactory signature.\nThis system can indicate that this mouse is John Smith. How does it\nalso tell that he’s your never-before-encountered brother? The closer the\nrelative, the more similar their cluster of MHC genes and the more\nsimilar their olfactory signature. Olfactory neurons in a mouse contain\nreceptors that respond most strongly to the mouse’s own MHC protein.\nThus, if the receptor is maximally stimulated, it means the mouse is\nsniffing its armpit. If near maximally stimulated, it’s a close relative.\nModerately, a distant relative. Not at all (though the MHC protein is\nbeing detected by other olfactory receptors), it’s a hippo’s armpit.*\nOlfactory recognition of kin accounts for a fascinating phenomenon.\nRecall from chapter 5 how the adult brain makes new neurons. In rats,\npregnancy triggers neurogenesis in the olfactory system. Why there? So\nthat olfactory recognition is in top form when it’s time to recognize your\nnewborn; if the neurogenesis doesn’t occur, maternal behavior is\nimpaired.25\nThen there is kin recognition based on imprinted sensory cues. How\ndo I know which newborn to nurse? The one who smells like my vaginal\nfluid. Which kid do I hang out near? The one who smells like Mom’s\nmilk. Many ungulates use such rules. So do birds. Which bird do I know\nis Mom? The bird whose distinctive song I learned before hatching.\nAnd there are species that figure out relatedness by reasoning; my\nguess is that male baboons make statistical inferences when identifying\ntheir likely offspring: “How much of this mom’s peak estrus swelling\nwas spent with me? All. Okay, this is my kid; act accordingly.” Which\nbrings us to the most cognitively strategic species, namely us. How do\nindividuals who share conspicuous traits with you? This facilitates\npassing on copies of genes if you possess a gene (or genes) with three\nproperties: (a) it generates that conspicuous signal; (b) recognizes it in\nothers; and (c) makes you cooperate with others who have that signal.\nIt’s a kind of primitive, stripped-down kin selection.\nHamilton speculated about the existence of such a “green-beard\neffect”; if an organism has a gene that codes for both growing a green\nbeard and cooperating with other green bearders, green bearders will\nflourish when mixed with non–green bearders.26 Thus, “the crucial\nrequirement for altruism is genetic relatedness at the altruism locus [i.e.,\nmerely a multifaceted green-beard gene] and not genealogical\nrelationship over the whole genome.”27\nGreen-beard genes exist. Among yeast, cells form cooperative\naggregates that need not be identical or even closely related. Instead, it\ncould be any yeast that expresses a gene coding for a cell-surface\nadhesion protein that sticks to copies of the same molecule on other\ncells.28\nHumans show green-beard effects. Crucially, we differ as to what\ncounts as a green-beard trait. Define it narrowly, and we call it\nparochialism. Include enmity toward those without that green-beard trait\no sometimes a chicken is an egg’s way of making another egg,\ngenes can be selfish, and sometimes we gladly lay down our lives\nfor two brothers or eight cousins. Does everything have to be about\ncompetition, about individuals or groups of relatives leaving more copies\nof their genes than the others, being more fit, having more reproductive\nsuccess?* Is the driving force of behavioral evolution always that\nsomeone be vanquished?\nNot at all. One exception is elegant, if specialized. Remember\nrock/paper/scissors? Paper envelops rock; rock breaks scissors; scissors\ncut paper. Would rocks want to bash every scissors into extinction? No\nway. Because then all those papers would enwrap the rocks into\nextinction. Each participant has an incentive for restraint, producing an\nequilibrium.\nRemarkably, such equilibriums occur in living systems, as shown in a\nstudy of the bacteria Escherichia coli.29 The authors generated three\ncolonies of E. coli, each with a strength and a weakness. To simplify:\nStrain 1 secretes a toxin. Strength: it can kill competitor cells. Weakness:\nmaking the toxin is energetically costly. Strain 2 is vulnerable to the\ntoxin, in that it has a membrane transporter that absorbs nutrients, and\nthe toxin slips in via that transporter. Strength: it’s good at getting food.\nWeakness: vulnerability to the toxin. Strain 3 doesn’t have the\ntransporter and thus isn’t vulnerable to the toxin, and it doesn’t make the\ntoxin. Strength: it doesn’t bear the cost of making the toxin and is\ninsensitive to it. Weakness: it doesn’t absorb as much nutrients. Thus,\ndestruction of strain 2 by strain 1 causes the demise of strain 1 thanks to\nstrain 3. The study showed that the strains could exist in equilibrium,\neach limiting its growth.\nCool. But it doesn’t quite fit our intuitions about cooperation.\nRock/paper/scissors is to cooperation as peace due to nuclear weapons–\nbased mutually assured destruction is to the Garden of Eden.\nDespite what you might expect from kin selection, unrelated animals\nfrequently cooperate. Fish swarm in a school, birds fly in formation.\nMeerkats take risks by giving alarm calls that aid everyone, vampire bats\nwho maintain communal colonies feed one another’s babies.*30\nDepending on the species, unrelated primates groom one another, mob\npredators, and share meat.\nWhy should nonrelatives cooperate? Because many hands lighten the\nload. School with other fish, and you’re less likely to be eaten\n(competition for the safest spot—the center—produces what Hamilton\ntermed the “geometry of the selfish herd”). Birds flying in a V formation\nsave energy by catching the updraft of the bird in front (raising the\nquestion of who gets stuck there).31 If chimps groom one another, there\nare fewer parasites.\nIn a key 1971 paper biologist Robert Trivers laid out the evolutionary\nlogic and parameters by which unrelated organisms engage in\n“reciprocal altruism”—incurring a fitness cost to enhance a nonrelative’s\nfitness, with the expectation of reciprocation.32\nIt doesn’t require consciousness to evolve reciprocal altruism; back\nto the metaphor of the airplane wing in the wind tunnel. But there are\nsome requirements for its occurrence. Obviously, the species must be\nsocial. Furthermore, social interactions have to be frequent enough that\nthe altruist and the indebted are likely to encounter each other again. And\nindividuals must be able to recognize each other.\nAmid reciprocal altruism occurring in numerous species, individuals\noften attempt to cheat (i.e., to not reciprocate) and monitor attempts by\nothers to do the same to them. This raises the realpolitik world of\ncheating and counterstrategies, the two coevolving in escalating arms\nraces. This is called a “Red Queen” scenario, for the Red Queen in\nThrough the Looking-Glass, who must run faster and faster to stay in\nplace.33\nThis raises two key interrelated questions:\nAmid the cold calculations of evolutionary fitness, when\nis it optimal to cooperate, when to cheat?\nCooperating Is Optimal?\nWhile biologists were formulating these questions, other scientists\nwere already starting to answer them. In the 1940s “game theory” was\nfounded by the polymath John von Neumann, one of the fathers of\ncomputer science. Game theory is the study of strategic decision making.\nFramed slightly differently, it’s the mathematical study of when to\ncooperate and when to cheat. The topic was already being explored with\nrespect to economics, diplomacy, and warfare. What was needed was for\ngame theorists and biologists to start talking. This occurred around 1980\nconcerning the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD), introduced in chapter 3. Time\nto see its parameters in detail.\nTwo members of a gang, A and B, are arrested. Prosecutors lack\nevidence to convict them of a major crime but can get them on a lesser\ncharge, for which they’ll serve a year in prison. A and B can’t\ncommunicate with each other. Prosecutors offer each a deal—inform on\nthe other and your sentence is reduced. There are four possible\noutcomes:\nBoth A and B refuse to inform on each other: each\nserves one year.\nBoth A and B inform on each other: each serves two\nyears.\nA informs on B, who remains silent: A walks free and B\nserves three years.\nB informs on A, who remains silent: B walks and A\nserves three years.\nThus, each prisoner’s dilemma is whether to be loyal to your partner\n(“cooperate”) or betray him (“defect”). The thinking might go, “Best to\ncooperate. This is my partner; he’ll also cooperate, and we’ll each serve\nIf you play PD once, there is a rational solution. If you, prisoner A,\ndefect, your sentence averages out to one year (zero years if B\ncooperates, two years if B defects); if you cooperate, the average is two\nyears (one year if B cooperates, three years if B defects). Thus you\nshould defect. In single-round versions of PD, it’s always optimal to\ndefect. Not very encouraging for the state of the world.\nSuppose there are two rounds of PD. The optimal strategy for the\nsecond round is just like in a single-round version—always defect. Given\nthat, the first-round defaults into being like a single-round game—and\nthus, defect during it also.\nWhat about a three-round game? Defect in the third, meaning that\nthings default into a two-round game. In which case, defect in the\nsecond, meaning defect in the first.\nIt’s always optimal to defect in round Z, the final round. And thus it’s\nalways optimal to defect in round Z−1, and thus round Z−2. . . . In other\nwords, when two individuals play for a known number of rounds, the\noptimal strategy precludes cooperation.\nBut what if the number of rounds is unknown (an “iterated” PD)?\nThings get interesting. Which is when the game theorists and biologists\nmet.\nThe catalyst was political scientist Robert Axelrod of the University\nof Michigan. He explained to his colleagues how PD works and asked\nthem what strategy they’d use in a game with an unknown number of\nrounds. The strategies offered varied enormously, with some being hair-\nraisingly complicated. Axelrod then programmed the various strategies\nand pitted them against each other in a simulated massive round-robin\ntournament. Which strategy won, was most optimal?\nIt was provided by a mathematician at the University of Toronto,\nAnatol Rapoport; as the mythic path-of-the-hero story goes, it was the\nsimplest strategy. Cooperate in the first round. After that, you do\nwhatever the other player did in the previous round. It was called Tit for\nTat. More details:\nYou cooperate (C) in the first round, and if the other player always\nSuppose the other player starts cooperating but then, tempted by\nSatan, defects (D) in round 10. You cooperated, and thus you take a hit:\nExample 2:\nYou:\tC C C C C C C C C C\nHer:\tC C C C C C C C C D\nThus, you Tit for Tat her, punishing her in the next round:\nExample 3:\nYou:\tC C C C C C C C C C D\nHer:\tC C C C C C C C C D ?\nIf by then she’s resumed cooperating, you do as well; peace returns:\nExample 4:\nYou:\tC C C C C C C C C C D C C C. . . .\nHer:\tC C C C C C C C C D C C C C. . . .\nIf she continues defecting, you do as well:\nExample 5:\nYou:\tC C C C C C C C C C D D D D D. . . .\nHer:\tC C C C C C C C C D D D D D D. . . .\nSuppose you play against someone who always defects. Things look\nlike this:\nExample 6:\nusing an “always cooperate” strategy. Otherwise it loses by a small\nmargin. Every other strategy would always beat Tit for Tat by a small\nmargin. However, other strategies playing against each other can produce\ncatastrophic losses. And when everything is summed, Tit for Tat wins. It\nlost nearly every battle but won the war. Or rather, the peace. In other\nwords, Tit for Tat drives other strategies to extinction.\nTit for Tat has four things going for it: Its proclivity is to cooperate\n(i.e., that’s its starting state). But it isn’t a sucker and punishes defectors.\nIt’s forgiving—if the defector resumes cooperating, so will Tit for Tat.\nAnd the strategy is simple.\nAxelrod’s tournament launched a zillion papers about Tit for Tat in\nPD and related games (more later). Then something crucial occurred—\nAxelrod and Hamilton hooked up. Biologists studying the evolution of\nbehavior longed to be as quantitative as those studying the evolution of\nkidneys in desert rats. And here was this world of social scientists\nstudying this very topic, even if they didn’t know it. PD provided a\nframework for thinking about the strategic evolution of cooperation and\ncompetition, as Axelrod and Hamilton explored in a 1981 paper (famous\nenough that it’s a buzz phrase—e.g., “How’d your lecture go today?”\n“Terrible, way behind schedule; I didn’t even get to Axelrod and\nHamilton”).34\nAs the evolutionary biologists started hanging with the political\nscientists, they inserted real-world possibilities into game scenarios. One\naddressed a flaw in Tit for Tat.\nLet’s introduce signal errors—a message is misunderstood, someone\nforgets to tell someone something, or there’s a hiccup of noise in the\nsystem. Like in the real world.\nThere has been a signal error in round 5, with two individuals using a\nTit for Tat strategy. This is what everyone means:\nExample 7:\nYou:\tC C C C C\nHer:\tC C C C D\nYou think, “What a creep, defecting like that.” You defect in the next\nround. Thus, what you think has happened:\nExample 9:\nYou:\tC C C C C D\nHer:\tC C C C D C\nWhat she thinks is happening, being unaware of the signal error:\nExample 10:\nYou:\tC C C C C D\nHer:\tC C C C C C\nShe thinks, “What a creep, defecting like that.” Thus she defects the\nnext round. “Oh, so you want more? I’ll give you more,” you think, and\ndefect. “Oh, so you want more? I’ll give you more,” she thinks:\nExample 11:\nYou:\tC C C C C D C D C D C D C D C D. . . .\nHer:\tC C C C D C D C D C D C D C D C. . . .\nWhen signal errors are possible, a pair of Tit for Tat players are\nvulnerable to being locked forever in this seesawing of defection.*\nThe discovery of this vulnerability prompted evolutionary biologists\nMartin Nowak of Harvard, Karl Sigmund of the University of Vienna,\nand Robert Boyd of UCLA to provide two solutions.35 “Contrite Tit for\nTat” retaliates only if the other side has defected twice in a row.\n“Forgiving Tit for Tat” automatically forgives one third of defections.\nBoth avoid doomsday signal-error scenarios but are vulnerable to\nexploitation.*\nagain”).\nAnother solution to Tit for Tat’s signal-error vulnerability is to use a\nshifting strategy. At the beginning, in an ocean of heterogeneous\nstrategies, many heavily biased toward defection, start with Tit for Tat.\nOnce they’ve become extinct, switch to Forgiving Tit for Tat, which\noutcompetes Tit for Tat when signal errors occur. What is this transition\nfrom hard-assed, punitive Tit for Tat to incorporating forgiveness?\nEstablishing trust.\nOther elaborations simulate living systems. The computer scientist\nJohn Holland of the University of Michigan introduced “genetic\nalgorithms”—strategies that mutate over time.\nAnother real-world elaboration was to factor in the “cost” of certain\nstrategies—for example, with Tit for Tat, the costs of monitoring for and\nthen punishing cheating—costly alarm systems, police salaries, and jail\nconstruction. These are superfluous in a world of no signal errors and\nnothing but Tit for Tat–ers, and Tit for Tat can be replaced by the cheaper\nAlways Cooperate.\nThus, when there are signal errors, differing costs to different\nstrategies, and the existence of mutations, a cycle emerges: a\nheterogeneous population of strategies, including exploitative,\nnoncooperative ones, are replaced by Tit for Tat, then replaced by\nForgiving Tit for Tat, then by Always Cooperate—until a mutation\nreintroduces an exploitative strategy that spreads like wildfire, a wolf\namong Always Cooperate sheep, starting the cycle all over again. . . .*36\nMore and more modifications made the models closer to the real world.\nSoon the computerized game strategies were having sex with each other,\nwhich must have been the most exciting thing ever for the\nmathematicians involved.\nThe evolutionary biologists were delighted to generate increasingly\nsophisticated models with the theoretical economists and theoretical\ndiplomats and theoretical war strategists. The real question was whether\nanimal behavior actually fits any of these models.\nOne bizarre animal system suggests Tit for Tat enforcement of\ncooperation involving the black hamlet fish, which form stable pair-\nbeen doing their sex-change tango, and most recently A was the\nexpensive female and B the cheap male. Suppose B cheats by staying\nmale, forcing A to continue as female; A switches to male and stays that\nway until B regains his social conscience and becomes female.\nAnother widely cited study suggested a Tit for Tat strategy among\nstickleback fish.38 The fish is in a tank, and on the other side of a glass\npartition is something scary—a bigger cichlid fish. The stickleback\ntentatively darts forward and back, investigating. Now put a mirror in its\ntank, perpendicular to the axis of the two fish. In other words, thanks to\nthe mirror, there appears to be a second cichlid next to the first.\nTerrifying, except from out of nowhere there’s this mysterious second\nstickleback who checks out the second cichlid every time our hero\nchecks out the first—“I have no idea who this guy is, but we’re an\namazing, coordinated team.”\nNow convince the stickleback his partner is defecting. Angle the\nmirror so that the stickleback’s reflection is deflected backward. Now\nwhen the fish darts forward, his reflection does as well, but—that jerk!—\nit looks like he’s hanging back safely (lagging back even half a body\nlength decreases the likelihood of a fish being predated). When the fish\nbelieves his partner is defecting, he stops darting forward.\nGreater complexity in Tit for Tat–ing is suggested by some animals\nhaving multiple roles in their social groups.39 Back to the playback\ntechnique with lions, where the roar of a strange male emanated from a\nspeaker in the bushes (or from a life-sized model of a lion). Lions\ntentatively came forward to investigate, a risky proposition. Consistently,\ncertain lions hung back. The toleration of these habitual scaredy-cats\nseemed to violate the demands of reciprocity, until it was recognized that\nsuch animals took the lead in other domains (e.g., in hunts). A similar\npunch line emerges concerning the Damaraland mole rat. The social\ngroups of it and its relative, the naked mole rat, resemble those of social\ninsects, with nonreproductive workers and a single breeding queen.*\nResearchers noted some workers who never worked and were\nconsiderably fatter than the rest. It turns out that they have two\nspecialized jobs—during the rains, they dig through flooded, collapsed\nhard for Martian zoologists to document in humans—after all, there are\nfrequently pairs where one human does all the labor, the other doing\nnothing other than intermittently handing him some green pieces of\npaper. The point is that animals have systems of reciprocity with\nsensitivity to cheating.\nGigantic Question #2: How Can Cooperation Ever\nStart?\nSo a handful of Tit for Tat–ers can outcompete a mix of other\nstrategies, including highly exploitative, uncooperative ones, losing the\nbattles but winning the war. But what if there’s only one Tit for Tat–er in\na population of ninety-nine Always Defect–ers? Tit for Tat doesn’t stand\na chance. Always Defect–ers playing each other produces the second-\nworst outcome for each. But a Tit for Tat–er playing an Always Defect–\ner does worse, getting the sucker payoff that first round before becoming\na de facto Always Defect–er. This raises the second great challenge for\nreciprocal altruism: forget which strategy is best at fostering cooperation\n—how do you ever start any type? Amid a sea of Always Defect–ers, the\nfirst black hamlet fish, mole rat, or Dictyostelium amoeba who, after\nreading Gandhi, Mandela, Axelrod, and Hamilton, takes the first\naltruistic step is screwed, lagging behind everyone else forever. One can\npractically hear the Always Defect amoebas chortling derisively.\nLet’s make it slightly easier for Tit for Tat to gain a foothold.\nConsider two Tit for Tat–ers amid ninety-eight Always Defect–ers. Both\nwill crash and burn . . . unless they find each other and form a stable\ncooperative core, where the Always Defect–ers either must switch to Tit\nfor Tat or go extinct. A nidus of cooperation crystallizes outward through\nthe population.\nThis is where green-beard effects help, conspicuous features of\ncooperators that help them recognize one another. Another mechanism is\nspatial, where the cooperative trait itself facilitates cooperators finding\none another.\n356\ndisappears), isolating a subset of a population for generations. What\nhappens in such a “founder population”? Inbreeding, fostering\ncooperation via kin selection. Eventually the land bridge reappears, the\ninbred cooperative founder population rejoins the main group, and\ncooperation propagates outward.*\nWe return to the issue of starting cooperation in the final chapter.\n\ne’ve now seen the three foundations of thinking about the\nevolution of behavior—individual selection, kin selection, and\nreciprocal altruism. Moreover, we’ve seen how these three concepts can\nexplain otherwise puzzling behaviors. Some concern individual\nselection, with competitive infanticide as the canonical example. Other\nbehaviors are most explicable with kin selection—why there’s male-male\naggression between groups in only some primate species; why many\nspecies have hereditary ranking systems; why cousin matings are more\nfrequent than one might expect. And some behaviors are all about\nreciprocal altruism. Why else would a vampire bat, aware of the\nvanquishing power of group selection, regurgitate blood for someone\nelse’s kid?\nLet’s consider a few more examples.\nPair-Bonding Versus Tournament Species\nSuppose you’ve discovered two new species of primates. Despite\nwatching both for years, here’s all you know: In species A, male and\nfemales have similar body sizes, coloration, and musculature; in species\nB, males are far bigger and more muscular than females and have flashy,\nconspicuous facial coloration (jargon: species B is highly “sexually\n358\nMale-female pairs of tamarins (top) and mandrills (bottom)\nFirst off, which species has dramatic, aggressive conflict among\nmales for high dominance rank? Species B, where males have been\nselected evolutionarily for fighting skills and display. Species A males,\nin contrast, are minimally aggressive—that’s why males haven’t been\nselected for muscle.\n\nreproduce a few times. The former describes species B—that’s what all\nthe rank competition is about—the latter, species A.\nNext, in one species, if a male mates with a female and she\nconceives, he’ll do a ton of child care. In contrast, no such male\n“parental investment” is seen in the other species. No-brainer: the former\ndescribes species A; the few species B males who father most of the kids\nsure aren’t doing child care.\nOne species has a tendency to twin, the other not. Easy—the\ntwinning is in species A, with two sets of parental hands available.\nHow picky are males about whom they mate with? In species B,\nmales mate with anyone, anywhere, anytime—it only costs the price of\nsome sperm. In contrast, males of species A, with its rule of “You get her\npregnant, you do child care,” are more selective. Related to that, which\nspecies forms stable pair-bonds? Species A, of course.\nAfter correcting for body size, which species’ males have bigger\ntestes and higher sperm count? It’s species B, ever prepared for mating,\nshould the opportunity arise.\nWhat do females look for in a potential mate? Species B females get\nnothing from a male except genes, so they should be good ones. This\nhelps explain the flamboyant secondary sexual characteristics of males\n—“If I can afford to waste all this energy on muscle plus these ridiculous\nneon antlers, I must be in great shape, with the sorts of genes you’d want\nin your kids.” In contrast, species A females look for stable, affiliative\nbehavior and good parenting skills in males. This is seen in bird species\nwith this pattern, where males display parenting expertise during\ncourtship—symbolically feeding the female with worms, proof that he’d\nbe a competent worm winner. Related to that, among bird versions of\nspecies A and B, in which is a female more likely to abandon her\noffspring, passing on more copies of her genes by breeding with another\nmale? Species A, where you see “cuckoldry”—because the male is going\nto stick there, caring for the kids.\nRelated to that, in species A, females compete aggressively to pair-\nbond with a particularly desirable (i.e., paternal) male. In contrast,\nspecies, B a “tournament” species.*\nPair-\nBonded\nTournament\nMale parental behavior\nExtensive\nMinimal\nMale mating pickiness\nHigh\nLow\nVariability in male reproductive success\nLow\nHigh\nTestes size, sperm count\nSmall/low\nLarge/high\nLevels of male-male aggression\nLow\nHigh\nDegree of sexual dimorphism in body weight, physiology,\ncoloration, and life span\nLow\nHigh\nFemales select for\nParenting\nskill\nGood genes\nRates of cuckoldry\nHigh\nLow\nPrimates that pair-bond include South American monkeys like\nmarmosets, tamarins, and owl monkeys, and among the apes, gibbons\n(with nonprimate examples including swans, jackals, beavers, and, of\ncourse, chapter 4’s prairie voles). Classic tournament species include\nbaboons, mandrills, rhesus monkeys, vervets, and chimps (with\nnonprimate examples including gazelles, lions, sheep, peacocks, and\nelephant seals). Not all species fit perfectly into either extreme (stay\ntuned). Nonetheless, the point is the internal logic with which the traits\nof each of these types of species cluster, based on these evolutionary\nprinciples.\nParent-Offspring Conflict\nAnother feature of behavior turns kin selection on its head. The\nemphasis until now has been on the fact that relatives share many genes\nand evolutionary goals. Nonetheless, except for identical twins, just as\npertinent is relatives not sharing all their genes or goals. Which can\ncause conflict.\nThis causes endless primate tantrums.41 Some female baboon looks\nfrazzled and cranky. Three steps behind is her toddler, making the most\npitiful whimpering and whining sounds imaginable. Every few minutes\nthe kid tries to nurse; Mom irritably pushes him away, even slaps him.\nMore wailing. It’s parent-offspring weaning conflict; as long as Mom\nnurses, she’s unlikely to ovulate, curtailing her future reproductive\npotential. Baboon moms evolved to wean their kids at the age where they\ncan feed themselves, and baboon kids evolved to try to delay that day.\nInterestingly, as females age, with decreasing likelihood of a future child,\nthey become less forceful in weaning.*\nThere’s also mother-fetus conflict. You’re a fetus with an\nevolutionary agenda. What do you want? Maximal nutrition from Mom,\nand who cares if that impacts her future reproductive potential?\nMeanwhile, Mom wants to balance current and future reproductive\nprospects. Remarkably, fetus and Mom have a metabolic struggle\ninvolving insulin, the pancreatic hormone secreted when blood glucose\nlevels rise, which triggers glucose entry into target cells. The fetus\nreleases a hormone that makes Mom’s cells unresponsive to insulin (i.e.,\n“insulin resistant”), as well as an enzyme that degrades Mom’s insulin.\nThus Mom absorbs less glucose from her bloodstream, leaving more for\nthe fetus.*\nIntersexual Genetic Conflict\nIn some species the fetus has an ally during maternal/fetal conflict—\nthe father. Consider a species where males are migratory, mating with\nfemales and then moving on, never to be seen again. What’s a male’s\nopinion about maternal/fetal conflict? Make sure the fetus, i.e., his child,\ngrabs as much nutrition as possible, even if that lessens Mom’s future\nreproductive potential—who cares, that won’t be his kid down the line.\nHe’s more than just rooting for his fetus.\nThis helps explain a mysterious, quirky feature of genetics. Normally\na gene works the same way, regardless of which parent it comes from.\nwhile maternal imprinted genes counter this. For example, some paternal\ngenes code for potent versions of growth factors, while the maternal\ngenes code for growth factor receptors that are relatively unresponsive.\nA paternally derived gene expressed in the brain makes newborns more\navid nursers; the maternally derived version counters this. It’s an arms\nrace, with Dad genetically egging on his offspring toward more growth\nat the cost of the female’s future reproductive plans, and Mom\ngenetically countering this with a more balanced reproductive strategy.*\nTournament species, where males have minimal investment in a\no we’ve got individual selection, kin selection, and reciprocal\naltruism. And then what happened in recent years? Group selection\nreappeared, sneaking in the back door.\n“Neo–group selection” crashed a long-standing debate as to the “unit\nof selection.”\nGenotype Versus Phenotype, and the Most\nMeaningful Level of Selection\nTo appreciate this, let’s contrast genotype and phenotype. Genotype =\nsomeone’s genetic makeup. Phenotype = the traits observable to the\noutside world produced by that genotype.*\nSuppose there’s a gene that influences whether your eyebrows come\nin two separate halves or form a continuous unibrow. You’ve noted that\nunibrow prevalence is decreasing in a population. Which is the more\nimportant level for understanding why—the gene variant or the eyebrow\nphenotype? We know after chapter 8 that genotype and phenotype are\nnot synonymous, because of gene/environment interactions. Maybe some\nprenatal environmental effect silences one version of the gene but not the\nother. Maybe a subset of the population belongs to a religion where you\nmust cover your eyebrows when around the opposite sex, and thus\neyebrow phenotype is untouched by sexual selection.\nYou’re a grad student researching unibrow decline, and you must\nchoose whether to study things at the genotypic or phenotypic level.\nGenotypic: sequencing eyebrow gene variants, trying to understand their\nregulation. Phenotypic: examining, say, eyebrow appearance and mate\nchoice, or whether unibrows absorb more heat from sunlight, thereby\ndamaging the frontal cortex, producing inappropriate social behavior and\ndecreased reproductive success.\nbeen Dawkins, with his iconic\n“selfish gene” meme—it is the gene\nthat is passed to the next\ngeneration, the thing whose variants\nspread or decline over time.\nMoreover, a gene is a clear and\ndistinctive sequence of letters,\nreductive and irrefutable, while\nphenotypic traits are much fuzzier\nand less distinct.\nThis is the core of the concept\nof “a chicken is just an egg’s way of making another egg”—the organism\nis just a vehicle for the genome to be replicated in the next generation,\nand behavior is just this wispy epiphenomenon that facilitates the\nreplication.\nThis gene-centered view can be divided in two. One is that the\ngenome (i.e., the collection of all the genes, regulatory elements, and so\non) is the best level to think about things. The more radical view, held by\nDawkins, is that the most appropriate level is that of individual genes—\ni.e., selfish genes, rather than selfish genomes.\nAmid some evidence for single-gene selection (an obscure\nphenomenon called intragenomic conflict, which we won’t go into),\nmost people who vote for the importance of gene(s) over phenotype view\nsingle-gene selfishness as a bit of a sideshow and vote for the genome\nlevel of selection being most important.\nMeanwhile, there’s the view that phenotype trumps genotype,\nsomething championed by Ernst Mayr, Stephen Jay Gould, and others.\nThe core of their argument is that it’s phenotypes rather than genotypes\nthat are selected for. As Gould wrote, “No matter how much power\nDawkins wishes to assign to genes, there is one thing he cannot give\nthem—direct visibility to natural selection.” In that view, genes and the\nfrequencies of their variants are merely the record of what arose from\nphenotypic selection.43\nDawkins introduced a great metaphor: a cake recipe is a genotype,\nall, there are recipe/environment interactions where bakers differ in their\nskill levels, cakes bake differently at various altitudes, etc. The recipe-\nversus-taste question can be framed practically: Your cake company isn’t\nselling enough cakes. Do you change the recipe or the baker?\nCan’t we all get along? There’s the obvious bleeding-heart answer,\nnamely that there’s room for a range of views and mechanisms in our\nrainbow-colored tent of evolutionary diversity. Different circumstances\nbring different levels of selection to the forefront. Sometimes the most\ninformative level is the single gene, sometimes the genome, sometimes a\nsingle phenotypic trait, sometimes the collection of all the organism’s\nphenotypic traits.44 We’ve just arrived at the reasonable idea of\nmultilevel selection.\nThe Resurrection of Group Selection\nHooray, progress. Sometimes it makes the most sense to pay\nattention to the recipe, sometimes to the baking process; the recipe is\nwhat is replicated, the taste what is chosen.\nBut there’s another level. Sometimes cake sales can be changed most\nconsequentially by altering something other than recipe or taste—\nadvertisements, packaging, or the perception of whether the cake is a\nstaple or a luxury. Sometimes sales are changed by tying the product to a\nparticular audience—think of products that advertise fair-trade practices,\nthe Nation of Islam’s Your Black Muslim Bakery, or the Christian\nfundamentalist ideology of Chick-fil-A restaurants. And in those cases\nrecipe and taste can both be trumped by ideology in purchasing\ndecisions.\nThis is where neo–group selection fits into multilevel selection—the\nidea that some heritable traits may be maladaptive for the individual but\nadaptive for a group. This has cooperation and prosociality written all\nover it, straight out of the analysis of Tit for Tat–ers finding one another\nin a sea of Always Defect–ers. Stated more formally, it’s when A\ndominates B but a group of Bs dominates a group of As.\nHere’s a great example of neo–group selectionism: As a poultry\nWhy was each superstar the egg queen in her original group?\nBecause she would aggressively peck subordinates enough to stress them\ninto reduced fertility. Put all these mean ones together, and a group of\nsubordinated chickens will outproduce them.\nThis is a world away from “animals behave for the good of the\nspecies.” Instead, this is the circumstance of a genetically influenced trait\nthat, while adaptive on an individual level, emerges as maladaptive when\nshared by a group and where there is competition between groups (e.g.,\nfor an ecological niche).\nThere’s been considerable resistance to neo–group selectionism. Part\nof it is visceral, often pronounced among the old guard—“Great, we’ve\nfinally confiscated all the Wild Kingdom videos, and now we’re back to\nplaying Whac-A-Mole with group selection sentimentality?” But the\nmore fundamental resistance is from people who distinguish bad old\ngroup selection from neo–group selection, accept that the latter can\noccur, but think it’s very rare.\nMaybe so, across the animal kingdom. But neo–group selection plays\nout with great frequency and consequence in humans. Groups compete\nfor hunting grounds, pastures, water sources. Cultures magnify the\nintensity of between-group selection and lessen within-group selection\nwith ethnocentrism, religious intolerance, race-based politics, and so on.\nThe economist Samuel Bowles, of the Santa Fe Institute, emphasizes\nhow intergroup conflict like war is the driving force for intragroup\ncooperation (“parochial altruism”); he refers to intergroup conflict as\n“altruism’s midwife.”46\nMost in the field now both accept multilevel selection and see room\nfor instances of neo–group selection, especially in humans. Much of this\nreemergence is the work of two scientists. The first is David Sloan\nWilson of the State University of New York at Binghamton, who spent\ndecades pushing for neo–group selection (although he sees it not really\nas “neo” but rather as old-style group selection finally getting some\nscientific rigor), generally being dismissed, and arguing his case with\nresearch of his own, studies ranging from fish sociality to the evolution\nof religion. He slowly convinced some people, most importantly the\nDavid Sloan Wilson’s ideas. And then a few years back, the octogenarian\nE. O. Wilson did something extraordinary—he decided he was wrong.\nAnd then he published a key paper with the other Wilson—“Rethinking\nthe Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology.” My respect for these two,\nboth as people and as scientists, is enormous.47\nThus something resembling détente has occurred among the\nadvocates for the importance of differing levels of selection. Our three-\nhere do humans fit into all this? Our behavior closely matches\nthe predictions of these evolutionary models. Until you look\nmore closely.48\nLet’s start by clearing up some misconceptions. First, we are not\ndescended from chimps. Or from any extant animal. We and chimps\nshare a common ancestor from roughly five million years ago (and\ngenomics show that chimps have been as busy evolving since then as we\nhave).49\nAnd there are misconceptions as to which ape is our “closest\nrelative.” In my experience, someone who is fond of duck hunting and\ncountry music usually votes chimp, but if you eat organic food and know\nabout oxytocin, it’s bonobo. The reality is that we’re equally related to\nboth, sharing roughly 98 to 99 percent of our DNA with each. Svante\nPääbo of the Max Planck Institutes in Germany has shown that 1.6\npercent of the human genome is more related to bonobos than to chimps;\n1.7 percent more to chimps than to bonobos.*50 Despite the combination\nof some of our most fervent wishes and excuses, we’re neither bonobos\nnor chimps.\nOn to how the conceptual building blocks of behavioral evolution\napply to humans.\nPromiscuous Tournament or Monogamous Pair-\nBonded?\nI can’t resist starting with an irresistible question—so, are we a pair-\nbonded or tournament species?51\nWestern civilization doesn’t give a clear answer. We praise stable,\ndevoted relationships yet are titillated, tempted, and succumb to\nalternatives at a high rate. Once divorces are legalized, a large percentage\nmonogamous. But most of those men would presumably be polygamous\nif they could buy more wives.\nWhat about human sexual dimorphism? Men are roughly 10 percent\ntaller and 20 percent heavier than women, need 20 percent more calories,\nand have life spans 6 percent shorter—more dimorphic than\nmonogamous species, less than polygamous ones. Likewise with subtle\nsecondary sexual characteristics like canine length, where men average\nslightly longer canines than women. Moreover, compared with, say,\nmonogamous gibbons, human males have proportionately bigger testes\nand higher sperm counts . . . but pale in comparison with polygamous\nchimps. And back to imprinted genes, reflecting intersexual genetic\ncompetition, which are numerous in tournament species and nonexistent\nin pair-bonders. What about humans? Some such genes, but not many.\nMeasure after measure, it’s the same. We aren’t classically\nmonogamous or polygamous. As everyone from poets to divorce\nattorneys can attest, we are by nature profoundly confused—mildly\npolygynous, floating somewhere in between.*\nIndividual Selection\nAt first pass we seem like a great example of a species where the\ndriving force on behavior is maximizing reproductive success, where a\nperson can be an egg’s way of making another egg, where selfish genes\ntriumph. Just consider the traditional perk of powerful men: being\npolygamous. Pharaoh Ramses II, incongruously now associated with a\nbrand of condoms, had 160 children and probably couldn’t tell any of\nthem from Moses. Within half a century of his death in 1953, Ibn Saud,\nthe founder of the Saudi dynasty, had more than three thousand\ndescendants. Genetic studies suggest that around sixteen million people\ntoday are descended from Genghis Khan. And in recent decades more\nthan one hundred children each were fathered by King Sobhuza II of\nSwaziland, Ibn Saud’s son King Saud, the dictator Jean-Bédel Bokassa\nof the Central African Republic, plus various fundamentalist Mormon\nleaders.52\nfemales for coercive sex or as a response to rejection.\nSo plenty of human behaviors would make sense to a baboon or\nelephant seal. But that’s only half the story. Despite Ramses, Ibn Saud,\nand Bokassa, numerous people forgo reproducing, often because of\ntheology or ideology. And an entire sect—the United Society of\nBelievers in Christ’s Second Appearing, aka the Shakers, will soon be\nextinct because of its adherents’ celibacy. And finally, the supposed\nselfishness of human genes driving individual selection must\naccommodate individuals sacrificing themselves for strangers.\nEarlier in the chapter I presented competitive infanticide as stark\nevidence of the importance of individual selection. Does anything like\nthat occur in humans? The psychologists Martin Daly and (the late)\nMargo Wilson of McMaster University in Canada looked at patterns of\nchild abuse and made a striking observation—a child is far more likely to\nbe abused or killed by a stepparent than by a parent. This is readily\nframed as parallel to competitive infanticide.53\nThis finding, termed the “Cinderella effect,” while embraced by\nhuman sociobiologists, has also been robustly criticized. Some charge\nthat socioeconomic status was not sufficiently controlled for (homes with\na stepparent, rather than two biological parents, generally have less\nincome and more economic stress, known causes of displacement\naggression). Others think there’s a detection bias—the same degree of\nabuse is more likely to be identified by authorities when it’s committed\nby a stepparent. And the finding has been independently replicated in\nsome but not all studies. I think the jury is still out on the subject.\nKin Selection\nWhere do humans fit in terms of kin selection? We’ve already seen\nexamples that fit well—e.g., the fraternal polyandry in Tibet, the\nweirdness of women liking the smell of their male cousins, the\nuniversality of nepotism.\nMoreover, humans are obsessed with kin relations in culture after\nculture, with elaborate systems of kinship terms (just go into a store and\nmaintain contact with their family of origin.54\nMoreover, from New Guinea highlanders to the Hatfields and\nMcCoys, feuds and vendettas occur along clan lines of relatedness. We\ntypically bequeath our money and land among our descendants rather\nthan among strangers. From ancient Egypt to North Korea and on to the\nKennedys and Bushes, we have dynastic rule. How’s this for a display of\nhuman kin selection: Subjects were given a scenario of a bus hurtling\ntoward a human and a nondescript dog, and they could only save one.\nWhom would they pick? It depended on degree of relatedness, as one\nprogressed from sibling (1 percent chose the dog over the sibling) to\ngrandparent (2 percent) to distant cousin (16 percent) to foreigner (26\npercent).55\nAs another measure of the importance of kinship in human\ninteractions, people can’t be compelled to testify in court against a first-\ndegree relative in many countries and American states. And when\nhumans have damage to the (emotional) vmPFC, they become so\nunemotionally utilitarian that they would choose to harm family\nmembers in order to save strangers.56\nThere’s a fascinating historical example of how wrong it feels when\nsomeone chooses strangers over kin. This is the story of Pavlik Morozov,\na boy in Stalin’s Soviet Union.57 Young Pavlik, according to the official\nstory, was a model citizen, an ardent flag-waving patriot. In 1932 he\nchose the state over his kin, denouncing his father (for supposed black\nmarketeering), who was promptly arrested and executed. Soon afterward\nthe boy was killed, allegedly by relatives who felt more strongly about\nkin selection than he did.\nThe regime’s propagandists embraced the story. Statues of the young\nmartyr to the revolution were erected. Poems and songs were written;\nschools were named for him. An opera was composed, a hagiographic\nmovie made.\nAs the story emerged, Stalin was told about the boy. And what was\nthe response of the man most benefiting from such fealty to the state?\nWas it “If only all my citizens were that righteous; this lad gives me hope\nThus even Stalin was of the same opinion as most mammals:\nsomething’s wrong with that kid. Human social interactions are\nprofoundly organized around kin selection; with the rare exception of a\nPavlik Morozov, blood is thicker than water.\nNaturally, until you look more closely.\nFor starters, yes, across cultures we are obsessed with kinship terms,\nbut the terms often don’t overlap with actual biological relatedness.\nWe certainly have clan vendettas, but we also have wars where\ncombatants on opposing sides have higher degrees of relatedness than do\nfighters on the same side. Brothers fought on opposing sides in the Battle\nof Gettysburg.58\nRelatives and their armies battle over royal succession; the cousins\nGeorge V of England, Nicholas II of Russia, and Wilhelm II of Germany\nhappily oversaw and sponsored World War I. And intrafamily individual\nviolence occurs (although at extremely low rates when corrected for\namount of time spent together). There’s patricide, often an act of revenge\nfor a long history of abuse, and fratricide. Rarely due to conflicts over\nissues of economic or reproductive importance—stolen birthrights of\nbiblical proportion, someone sleeping with their sibling’s spouse—\nfratricide is most often about long-standing irritants and disagreements\nthat just happen to boil over into lethality (in early May 2016, for\nexample, a Florida man was charged with second-degree murder in the\nkilling of his brother—during a dispute over a cheeseburger). And then\nthere is the hideous commonness of honor killings in parts of the world,\nas we’ve seen.59\nThe most puzzling cases of intrafamily violence, in terms of kin\nselection, are of parents killing children, a phenomenon most commonly\narising from combined homicide/suicide, profound mental illness, or\nabuse that unintentionally proves fatal.*60 And then there are cases\nwhere a mother kills an unwanted child who is viewed as a hindrance—\nparent/offspring conflict flecked with the spittle of madness.61\nWhile we bequeath money to our descendants, we also give\ncharitably to strangers on the other side of the planet (thank you, Bill and\nMelinda Gates) and adopt orphans from other continents. (Sure, as we’ll\ndegree of relatedness.\nThus we have textbook examples of kin selection, but also dramatic\nexceptions.\nWhy do humans have such marked deviations from kin selection? I\nthink this often reflects how humans go about recognizing relatives. We\ndon’t do it with certainty, by innate recognition of MHC-derived\npheromones, the way rodents do (despite our being able to distinguish\ndegrees of relatedness to some extent by smell). Nor do we do it by\nimprinting on sensory cues, deciding, “This person is my mother because\nI remember that her voice was the loudest when I was a fetus.”\nInstead we do kin recognition cognitively, by thinking about it. But\ncrucially, not always rationally—as a general rule, we treat people like\nrelatives when they feel like relatives.\nOne fascinating example is the Westermarck effect, demonstrated by\nmarriage patterns among people raised in the Israeli kibbutz system.62\nCommunal child rearing is central to the ethos of the traditional socialist\nagricultural kibbutz approach. Children know who their parents are and\ninteract with them a few hours a day. But otherwise they live, learn, play,\neat, and sleep with the cohort of kids their age in communal quarters\nstaffed by nurses and teachers.\nIn the 1970s anthropologist Joseph Shepher examined records of all\nthe marriages that had ever occurred between people from the same\nkibbutz. And out of the nearly three thousand occurrences, there was no\ninstance of two individuals marrying who had been in the same age\ngroup during their first six years of life. Oh, people from the same peer\ngroup typically had loving, close, lifelong relationships. But no sexual\nattraction. “I love him/her to pieces, but am I attracted? Yech—he/she\nfeels like my sibling.” Who feels like a relative (and thus not like a\npotential mate)? Someone with whom you took a lot of baths when you\nboth were kids.\nHow’s this for irrationality? Back to people deciding whether to save\nthe person or the dog. The decision depended not only on who the person\nwas (sibling, cousin, stranger) but also on who the dog was—a strange\ndog or your own. Remarkably, 46 percent of women would save their\nSadie.”\n—\nHuman irrationality in distinguishing kin from nonkin takes us to the\nheart of our best and worst behaviors. This is because of something\ncrucial—we can be manipulated into feeling more or less related to\nsomeone than we actually are. When it is the former, wonderful things\nhappen—we adopt, donate, advocate for, empathize with. We look at\nsomeone very different from us and see similarities. It is called\npseudokinship. And the converse? One of the tools of the propagandist\nand ideologue drumming up hatred of the out-group—blacks, Jews,\nMuslims, Tutsis, Armenians, Roma—is to characterize them as animals,\nvermin, cockroaches, pathogens. So different that they hardly count as\nhuman. It’s called pseudospeciation, and as will be seen in chapter 15, it\nunderpins many of our worst moments.\nReciprocal Altruism and Neo–Group Selectionism\nThere’s not much to say here other than that this is the most\ninteresting stuff in the chapter. When Axelrod got his round-robin\ntournament all fired up, he didn’t canvass, say, fish for their Prisoner’s\nDilemma strategies. He asked humans.\nWe’re the species with unprecedented cooperation among unrelated\nindividuals, even total strangers; Dictyostelium colonies are green with\nenvy at the human ability to do a wave in a football stadium. We work\ncollectively as hunter-gatherers or as IT execs. Likewise when we go to\nwar or help disaster victims a world away. We work as teams to hijack\nplanes and fly them into buildings, or to award a Nobel Peace Prize.\nRules, laws, treaties, penalties, social conscience, an inner voice,\nmorals, ethics, divine retribution, kindergarten songs about sharing—all\ndriven by the third leg of the evolution of behavior, namely that it is\nevolutionarily advantageous for nonrelatives to cooperate. Sometimes.\nOne manifestation of this strong human tendency has been\nappreciated recently by anthropologists. The standard view of hunter-\nthe group of her new husband), while the groovy-hunter-gatherers\nversion tied it to matrilocality (i.e., the opposite). However, a study of\nmore than five thousand people from thirty-two hunter-gatherer societies\nfrom around the world* showed that only around 40 percent of people\nwithin bands are blood relatives.63 In other words, hunter-gatherer\ncooperativeness, the social building block of 99 percent of hominin\nhistory, rests at least as much on reciprocal altruism among nonrelatives\nas on kin selection (with chapter 9’s caveat that this assumes that\ncontemporary hunter-gatherers are good stand-ins for ancestral ones).\nSo humans excel at cooperation among nonrelatives. We’ve already\nconsidered circumstances that favor reciprocal altruism; this will be\nreturned to in the final chapter. Moreover, it’s not just groups of nice\nchickens outcompeting groups of mean ones that has revivified group\nselectionism. It is at the core of cooperation and competition among\nhuman groups and cultures.\nThus humans deviate from the strict predictions concerning the\npointed out earlier a requirement for neo–group selection, namely that\ngenes be involved in a trait that differs more between than within groups.\nThis applies to everything in this chapter. The first requirement for a trait\nto evolve is that it be heritable. But this is often forgotten along the way,\nas evolutionary models tacitly assume genetic influences. Chapter 8\nshowed how tenuous is the idea that there is “the gene,” or even genes,\n“for” aggression, intelligence, empathy, and so on. Given that, even more\ntenuous would be the idea of a gene(s) for maximizing your reproductive\nsuccess by, say, “mating indiscriminately with every available female,”\nor by “abandoning your kids and finding a new mate, because the father\nwill raise them.”\nSo critics will often demand, “Show me the gene that you assume is\nEVOLUTIONARY CHANGE\nCONTINUOUS AND GRADUAL?\nhe term “evolution” carries context-dependent baggage. If you’re in\nthe Bible Belt, evolution is leftist besmirching of God, morality,\nand human exceptionalism. But to extreme leftists, “evolution” is a\nreactionary term, the slow change that impedes real change—“All reform\nundermines revolution.” This next challenge addresses whether evolution\nis actually more about rapid revolution than about slow reform.\nA basic sociobiological premise is that evolutionary change is\ngradual, incremental. As a selective pressure gradually changes, a useful\ngene variant grows more common in a population’s gene pool. As\nenough changes accrue, the population may even constitute a new\nspecies (“phyletic gradualism”). Over millions of years, dinosaurs\ngradually turn into chickens, organisms emerge that qualify as mammals\nas glandular secretions slowly evolve into milk, thumbs increasingly\noppose in proto-primates. Evolution is gradual, continuous.\nIn 1972 Stephen Jay Gould and paleontologist Niles Eldredge of the\nAmerican Museum of Natural History proposed an idea that simmered\nand then caught fire in the 1980s. They argued that evolution isn’t\ngradual; instead, most of the time nothing happens, and evolution occurs\nin intermittent rapid, dramatic lurches.64\nPunctuated Equilibrium\nTheir idea, which they called punctuated equilibrium, was anchored\nin paleontology. Fossil records, we all know, show gradualism—human\nancestors show progressively larger skulls, more upright posture, and so\non. And if two fossils in chronological progression differ a lot, a jump in\nthe gradualism, there must be an intermediate form that is the “missing\nEldredge’s and Gould’s specialties, respectively) and didn’t show\ngradualism. Instead there were long periods of stasis, of unchanged\nfossils, and then, in a paleontological blink of an eye, there’d be a rapid\ntransition to a very different form. Maybe evolution is mostly like this,\nthey argued. What triggers punctuated events of sudden change? A\nsudden, massive selective factor that kills most of a species, the only\nsurvivors being ones with some obscure genetic trait that turned out to be\nvital—an “evolutionary bottleneck.”\nWhy does punctuated equilibrium challenge sociobiological\nthinking? Sociobiological gradualism implies that every smidgen of\ndifference in fitness counts, that every slight advantage of one individual\nover another at leaving copies of genes in future generations translates\ninto evolutionary change. At every juncture, optimizing competition,\ncooperation, aggression, parental investment, all of it, is evolutionarily\nconsequential. And if instead there is mostly evolutionary stasis, much of\nthis chapter becomes mostly irrelevant.*\nThe sociobiologists were not amused. They called the punctuated\nequilibrium people “jerks” (while the punctuated equilibrium people\ncalled them “creeps”—get it? PE = evolution in a series of jerks;\nsociobiology = evolution as a gradual, creeping process).* Gradualist\nsociobiologists responded with strong rebuttals, taking a number of\nforms:\nThey’re just snail shells. First, there are some very complete fossil\nlineages that are gradualist. And don’t forget, said the gradualists, these\npunctuated equilibrium guys are talking about trilobite and snail fossils.\nThe fossil record we’re most interested in—primates, hominins—is too\nspotty to tell if it is gradualist or punctuated.\nHow fast do their eyes blink? Next, said the gradualists, remember,\nthese punctuated equilibrium fans are paleontologists. They see long\nperiods of stasis and then extremely rapid blink-of-the-eye changes in the\nfossil record. But with fossils the blink of an eye, a stretch of time\nunresolvably short in the fossil record, could be 50,000 to 100,000 years.\nThat’s plenty of time for evolution bloody in tooth and claw to happen.\nshells, bugs in amber. Not organs—brains, pituitaries, ovaries. Not cells\n—neurons, endocrine cells, eggs, sperm. Not molecules—\nneurotransmitters, hormones, enzymes. In other words, none of the\ninteresting stuff. Those punctuated equilibrium nudniks spend their\ncareers measuring zillions of snail shells and, based on that, say we’re\nwrong about the evolution of behavior?\nThis opens the way for some compromise. Maybe the hominin pelvis\ndid indeed evolve in a punctuated manner, with long periods of stasis and\nbursts of rapid change. And maybe the pituitary’s evolution was\npunctuated as well, but with punctuations at different times. And maybe\nsteroid hormone receptors and the organization of frontocortical neurons\nand the inventions of oxytocin and vasopressin all evolved that way also,\nbut each undergoing punctuated change at a different time. Overlap and\naverage these punctuated patterns, and it will be gradualist. This only\ngets you so far, though, since it assumes the occurrence of numerous\nevolutionary bottlenecks.\nWhere’s the molecular biology? One of the strongest gradualist\nretorts was a molecular one. Micromutation, consisting of point,\ninsertion, and deletion mutations that subtly change the function of\npreexisting proteins, is all about gradualism. But what mechanisms of\nmolecular evolution explain rapid, dramatic change and long periods of\nstasis?\nAs we saw in chapter 8, recent decades have provided many possible\nmolecular mechanisms for rapid change. This is the world of\nmacromutations: (a) traditional point, insertion, and deletion mutations in\ngenes whose proteins have amplifying network effects (transcription\nfactors, splicing enzymes, transposes) in an exon expressed in multiple\nproteins in genes for enzymes involved in epigenetics; (b) traditional\nmutations in promoters, transforming the when/where/how-much of gene\nexpression (remember that promoter change that makes polygamous\nvoles monogamous); (c) untraditional mutations such as the duplication\nor deletion of entire genes. All means for big, rapid changes.\nBut what about a molecular mechanism for the stasis? Plunk a\nrandom mutation into a transcription-factor gene, thereby creating a new\nParachute a transposable genetic element into the middle of some gene,\nchange a splicing enzyme so that it mixes and matches different exons in\nmultiple proteins. Both asking for major trouble. Implicit in this is stasis,\na conservatism about evolutionary change—it takes very unique macro\nchanges during times of very unique challenge to luck out.\nShow us some actual rapid change. A final rebuttal from gradualists\nwas to demand real-time evidence of rapid evolutionary change in\nspecies. And plenty exist. One example was wonderful research by the\nRussian geneticist Dmitry Belyaev, who in the 1950s domesticated\nSiberian silver foxes.65 He bred captive ones for their willingness to be\nin proximity to humans, and within thirty-five generations he’d\ngenerated tame foxes who’d cuddle in your arms. Pretty punctuated, I’d\nsay. The problem here is that this is artificial rather than natural\nselection.\nInterestingly, the opposite has occurred in Moscow, which has a\npopulation of thirty thousand feral dogs dating back to the nineteenth\ncentury (and where some contemporary dogs have famously mastered\nMost likely, the first generations of these feral populations were subject\nto fierce selection for these traits, and it’s their descendants who\ncomprise the current population.*67\nFeral Moscow dogs\nRapid change in the human gene pool has occurred as well with the\nspread of lactase persistence—a change in the gene for the enzyme\ndon’t use dairy after weaning—Chinese and Southeast Asians. Lactase\npersistence evolved and spread in a fraction of a geologic blink of an eye\n—in the last ten thousand years or so, coevolving with domestication of\ndairy animals.\nOther genes have spread in humans even faster. For example, a\nvariant of a gene called ASPM, which is involved in cell division during\nbrain development, has emerged and spread to about 20 percent of\nhumans in the last 5,800 years.69 And genes that confer resistance to\nmalaria (at the cost of other diseases, such as sickle-cell disease or the\nthalassemias) are even younger.\nStill, thousands of years counts as fast only for snail shell obsessives.\nHowever, evolution has been observed in real time. A classic example is\nthe work of the Princeton evolutionary biologists Peter and Rosemary\nGrant, who, over the course of decades of work in the Galapagos,\ndemonstrated substantial evolutionary change in Darwin’s finches.\nEvolutionary change in humans has occurred in genes related to\nmetabolism, when populations transition from traditional to Westernized\ndiets (e.g., Pacific Islanders from Nauru, Native Americans of the Pima\ntribe in Arizona). The first generations with Westernized diets develop\ncatastrophically high rates of obesity, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes,\nand death at early ages, thanks to “thrifty” genotypes that are great at\nstoring nutrients, honed by millennia of sparser diets. But within a few\ngenerations diabetes rates begin to subside, as there is an increased\nprevalence in the population of “sloppier” metabolic genotypes.70\nThus, there are examples of rapid changes in gene frequencies in real\ntime. Are there examples of gradualism? That’s hard to show because\ngradual change is, er, gradual. A great example, however, comes from\ndecades of work by Richard Lenski of Michigan State University. He has\ncultured E. coli bacteria colonies under constant conditions for 58,000\ngenerations, roughly equivalent to a million years of human evolution.\nOver that time, different colonies have gradually evolved in distinctive\nways, becoming more adapted.71\nThus, both gradualism and punctuated change occur in evolution,\nprobably depending upon the genes involved—for example, there has\n383\ndegree of gradualism—no female has ever given birth to a member of a\nnew species.72\n\nPOLITICS: IS EVERYTHING ADAPTIVE?\ns we’ve seen, variants of genes that make organisms more adapted\nto their environment increase in frequency over time. But what\nabout the reverse—if a trait is prevalent in a population, must it mean\nthat it evolved in the past because it was adaptive?73\n“Adaptationism” assumes this is typically the case; an adaptationist\napproach is to determine whether a trait is indeed adaptive and, if so,\nwhat the selective forces were that brought it about. Much of\nsociobiological thinking is adaptationist in flavor.\nThis was subject to scathing criticism by the likes of Stephen Jay\nGould and Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin, who mocked the\napproach as “just so” stories, after Kipling’s absurdist fantasies about\nhow certain traits came to be: how the elephant got its trunk (because of\na tug-of-war with a crocodile), how the zebra got its stripes, how the\ngiraffe got a long neck. So why not, supposedly ask the sociobiologists\nin this critique, how the baboon male got big cojones while the gorilla\nmale got little ones? Observe a behavior, generate a just-so story that\nassumes adaptation, and the person with the best just-so story wins. How\nthe evolutionary biologist got his tenure. In their view, sociobiological\nstandards lack rigor. As one critic, Andrew Brown, stated, “The problem\nwas that sociobiology explained too much and predicted too little.”74\nAccording to Gould, traits often evolve for one reason and are later\nco-opted for another use (fancy term: “exaptation”); for example,\nfeathers predate the evolution of bird flight and originally evolved for\ninsulation.75 Only later did their aerodynamic uses become relevant.\nSimilarly, the duplication of a gene for a steroid hormone receptor (as\nmentioned many chapters ago) allowed one copy to randomly drift in its\nDNA sequence, producing an “orphan” receptor with no use—until a\nnovel steroid hormone was synthesized that happened to bind to it. This\nhaphazard, jury-rigged quality evokes the aphorism “Evolution is a\nhour). But they’re damn good for something whose great-great-\ngrandparents were mollusks.\nMeanwhile, ran the criticism, some traits exist not because they’re\nadaptive, or were adapted for something else but got co-opted, but\nbecause they’re baggage carried along with other traits that were selected\nfor. It was here that Gould and Lewontin famously introduced\n“spandrels” in their 1979 paper “The Spandrels of San Marco and the\nPanglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme.” A\nspandrel is an architectural term for the space between two arches, and\nGould and Lewontin considered the artwork on the spandrels of the\nBasilica San Marco in Venice.*\nGould and Lewontin’s\nstereotypical adaptationist would\nlook at these spandrels and\nconclude that they were built to\nprovide spaces for the artwork. In\nother words, that these spandrels\nevolved for their adaptive value in\nproviding space for art. In reality\nthey didn’t evolve for a purpose—if\nyou’re going to have a series of\narches (which most definitely exist\nfor the adaptive purpose of holding\nup a dome), a space between each\npair is an inevitable by-product. No\nadaptation. And as long as these\nspaces were carried along as\nevolutionary baggage as a result of\nselection for the adaptive arches,\nmight as well paint on them. In that\nview, male nipples are spandrels—they serve an adaptive role in females\nand came along for the ride as baggage in males because there’s been no\nparticular selection against males having them.* Gould and Lewontin\nin pronouncing it adaptive.76 In other words, the former provide just-not-\nso stories. Psychologist David Barash and psychiatrist Judith Lipton\ncompared spandrelites to the character Topsy in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, who\nstates that she “just growed”—when faced with evidence of adaptation in\ntraits, they’d conclude that those traits are mere baggage, without\nadaptive purpose, providing explanations that explained nothing—“just\ngrowed stories.”\nFurthermore, sociobiologists argued, adaptationist approaches were\nmore rigorous than Gouldian caricature; rather than explaining\neverything and predicting nothing, sociobiological approaches predict\nplenty. Is, say, competitive infanticide a just-so story? Not when you can\npredict with some accuracy whether it will occur in a species based on its\nsocial structure. Nor is the pair-bond/tournament comparison, when you\ncan predict a vast amount of information about the behavior, physiology,\nand genetics of species ranging across the animal kingdom simply by\nknowing their degree of sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, evolution\nleaves an echo of selection for adaptive traits when there is evidence of\n“special design”—complex, beneficial functions where a number of\ntraits converge on the same function.\n—\nAll this would be your basic, fun academic squabble, except that\nunderlying the criticisms of adaptationism, gradualism, and sociobiology\nis a political issue. This is embedded in the title of the spandrel paper:\nthe “Panglossian paradigm.” This refers to Voltaire’s Dr. Pangloss and\nhis absurd belief, despite life’s miseries, that this is the “best of all\npossible worlds.” In this criticism, adaptationism stinks of the\nnaturalistic fallacy, the view that if nature has produced something, it\nmust be a good thing. That furthermore, “good” in the sense of, say,\nsolving the selective problem of water retention in deserts, is in some\nindefinable way also morally “good.” That if ant species make slaves, if\nmale orangutans frequently rape females, and if for hundreds of\nthousands of years hominin males drink milk directly out of the\ncontainer, it is because it is somehow “meant” to be that way.\none storied occasion, E. O. Wilson was physically attacked while giving\na talk.* Anthropology departments split in two, collegial relationships\nwere destroyed. This was particularly so at Harvard, where many of the\nprincipals could be found—Wilson, Gould, Lewontin, Trivers, Hrdy, the\nprimatologist Irven DeVore, the geneticist Jonathan Beckwith.\nThings were so febrile because sociobiology was accused of using\nbiology to justify the status quo—conservative social Darwinism that\nimplied that if societies are filled with violence, unequal distribution of\nresources, capitalistic stratification, male dominance, xenophobia, and so\non, these things are in our nature and probably evolved for good reasons.\nThe critics used the “is versus ought” contrast, saying, “Sociobiologists\nimply that when an unfair feature of life is the case, it is because it ought\nto be.” And the sociobiologists responded by flipping is/ought around:\n“We agree that life ought to be fair, but nonetheless, this is reality.\nSaying that we advocate something just because we report it is like\nsaying oncologists advocate cancer.”\nThe conflict had a personal tinge. This was because by chance (or\nnot, depending on your viewpoint), that first generation of American\nsociobiologists were all white Southerners—Wilson, Trivers,* DeVore,\nHrdy; in contrast, the first generation of its loudest critics were all\nNortheastern, urban, Jewish leftists—Harvard’s Gould, Lewontin,\nBeckwith, Ruth Hubbard, Princeton’s Leon Kamin, and MIT’s Noam\nChomsky. You can see how the “there’s a hidden agenda here” charge\narose from both sides.*\nIt’s easy to see how punctuated equilibrium generated similar\nideological battles, given its premise that evolution is mostly about long\nperiods of stasis pierced by revolutionary upheaval. In their original\npublication, Gould and Eldredge asserted that the law of nature “holds\nthat a new quality emerges in a leap as the slow accumulation of\nquantitative changes, long resisted by a stable system, finally forces it\nrapidly from one state into another.” This was a bold assertion that the\nheuristic of dialectical materialism not only extends beyond the\neconomic world into the naturalistic one, but is ontologically rooted in\ngradualism versus punctuated change, and the very notion of a science of\nhuman sociobiology subsided. The political posturing lost steam, the\ndemographic contrasts between the two camps softened, the general\nquality of research improved considerably, and everybody got some gray\nhair and a bit more calm.\nThis has paved the way for a sensible, middle-of-the-road middle age\nfor the field. There’s clear empirical evidence for both gradualism and\npunctuated change, and for molecular mechanisms underlying both.\nThere’s less adaptation than extreme adaptationists claim, but fewer\nspandrels than touted by spandrelites. While sociobiology may explain\ntoo much and predict too little, it does predict many broad features of\nbehavior and social systems across species. Moreover, even though the\nnotion of selection happening at the level of groups has been resurrected\nfrom the graves of self-sacrificial elderly wildebeest, it is probably a rare\noccurrence; nonetheless, it is most likely to occur in the species that is\nthe focus of this book. Finally, all of this is anchored in evolution being a\nfact, albeit a wildly complex one.\n—\nRemarkably, we’ve finished this first part of the book. A behavior has\noccurred; what happened in everything from a second to a million years\nearlier that helps explain why it happened? Some themes have come up\nrepeatedly:\nThe context and meaning of a behavior are usually more\ninteresting and complex than the mechanics of the\nbehavior.\nTo understand things, you must incorporate neurons and\nhormones and early development and genes, etc., etc.\nThese aren’t separate categories—there are few clear-cut\ncausal agents, so don’t count on there being the brain\nregion, the neurotransmitter, the gene, the cultural\nproclivities, interactions, modulations, contingencies,\nif/then clauses, context dependencies, exacerbation or\ndiminution of preexisting tendencies. Circles and loops\nand spirals and Möbius strips.\nNo one said this was easy. But the subject matters.\n—"

    "start_page": 391,

    "content": "Us Versus Them\ns a kid, I saw the original 1968 version of Planet of the Apes. As\na future primatologist, I was mesmerized, saw it repeatedly, and\nloved the cheesy ape costumes.\nYears later I discovered a great anecdote about the filming of the\nmovie, related by both Charlton Heston and Kim Hunter, its stars: at\nlunchtime, the people playing chimps and those playing gorillas ate in\nseparate groups.1\nAs it’s been said (most often attributed to Robert Benchley), “There\nare two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into\ntwo kinds of people and those who don’t.” There are more of the first.\nAnd it is vastly consequential when people are divided into Us and\nThem, in-group and out-group, “the people” (i.e., our kind) and the\nOthers.\nThis chapter explores our tendency to form Us/Them dichotomies\nand to favor the former. Is this mind-set universal? How malleable are\n“Us” and “Them” categories? Is there hope that human clannishness and\nur brains form Us/Them\ndichotomies (henceforth,\n“Us/Them-ing,” for brevity) with\nstunning speed.2 As discussed in\nchapter 3, fifty-millisecond\nexposure to the face of someone of\nanother race activates the\namygdala, while failing to activate\nthe fusiform face area as much as\nsame-race faces do—all within a\nfew hundred milliseconds.\nSimilarly, the brain groups faces by\ngender or social status at roughly\nthe same speed.\nRapid, automatic biases against a Them can be demonstrated with the\nfiendishly clever Implicit Association Test (IAT).3\nSuppose you are unconsciously prejudiced against trolls. To simplify\nthe IAT enormously: A computer screen flashes either pictures of\nhumans or trolls or words with positive connotations (e.g., “honest”) or\nnegative ones (“deceitful”). Sometimes the rule is “If you see a human or\na positive term, press the red button; if it’s a troll or a negative term,\npress the blue button.” And sometimes it’s “Human or negative term,\npress red; troll or positive term, press blue.” Because of your antitroll\nbias, pairing a troll with a positive term, or a human with a negative, is\ndiscordant and slightly distracting. Thus you pause for a few\nmilliseconds before pressing a button.\nIt’s automatic—you’re not fuming about clannish troll business\npractices or troll brutality in the Battle of Somewhere in 1523. You’re\nprocessing words and pictures, and unconsciously you pause, stopped by\nthe dissonance linking troll and “lovely,” or human and “malodorous.”\ngenerosity, and cooperation toward Us but crappier behavior toward\nThem—more preemptive aggression in economic play, more advocacy\nof sacrificing Them (but not Us) for the greater good. Oxytocin\nexaggerates Us/Them-ing.\nThis is hugely interesting. If you like broccoli but spurn cauliflower,\nno hormone amplifies both preferences. Ditto for liking chess and\ndisdaining backgammon. Oxytocin’s opposing effects on Us and Them\ndemonstrate the salience of such dichotomizing.\nOur depth of Us/Them-ing is supported further by something\nremarkable—other species do it as well. Initially this doesn’t seem\nprofound. After all, chimps kill males from other groups, baboon troops\nbristle when encountering each other, animals of all stripes tense at\nstrangers.\nThis simply reflects not taking kindly to someone new, a Them. But\nsome other species have a broader concept of Us and Them.4 For\nexample, chimp groups that have swollen in number might divide;\nmurderous animosities soon emerge between ex-groupmates.\nRemarkably, you can show automatic Us/Them-ing in other primates\nwith a monkey equivalent of the IAT. In one study animals were shown\npictures of either members of their own or the neighboring group,\ninterspersed with positive things (e.g., fruit) or negative (e.g., spiders).\nAnd monkeys looked longer at discordant pairings (e.g., group members\nwith spiders). These monkeys don’t just fight neighbors over resources.\nThey have negative associations with them—“Those guys are like yucky\nspiders, but us, us, we’re like luscious tropical fruit.”*\nNumerous experiments confirm that the brain differentially processes\nimages within milliseconds based on minimal cues about race or gender.5\nSimilarly, consider “minimal group” paradigms, pioneered in the 1970s\nby Henri Tajfel of the University of Bristol. He showed that even if\ngroupings are based on flimsy differences (e.g., whether someone over-\nor underestimated the number of dots in a picture), in-group biases, such\nas higher levels of cooperation, still soon develop. Such prosociality is\nabout group identification—people preferentially allocate resources to\nanonymous in-group individuals.\nwho came up heads on the coin toss (in contrast to our admirable tails)\neat their dead.\nThe power of minimal, arbitrary groupings to elicit Us/Them-ing\nrecalls “green-beard effects” from chapter 10. Recall how these hover\nbetween prosociality due to kin selection and due to reciprocal altruism\n—they require an arbitrary, conspicuous, genetically based trait (e.g., a\ngreen beard) that indicates a tendency to act altruistically toward other\ngreen-bearders—under those conditions, green-bearders flourish.\nUs/Them-ing based on minimal shared traits is like psychological\nrather than genetic green-beard effects. We feel positive associations\nwith people who share the most meaningless traits with us.\nAs a great example, in one study subjects conversed with a\nresearcher who, unbeknownst to them, did or didn’t mimic their\nmovements (for example, leg crossing).6 Not only is mimicry pleasing,\nactivating mesolimbic dopamine, but it also made subjects more likely to\nhelp the researcher, picking up their dropped pen. An unconscious Us-\nness born from someone slouching in a chair like you do.\nThus an invisible strategy becomes yoked to an arbitrary green-beard\nmarker. What helps define a particular culture? Values, beliefs,\nattributions, ideologies. All invisible, until they are yoked with arbitrary\nmarkers such as dress, ornamentation, or regional accent. Consider two\nvalue-laden approaches to what to do to a cow: (A) eat it; (B) worship it.\nTwo As or two Bs would be more peaceful when sorting out cow options\nthan an A and B together. What might reliably mark someone who uses\napproach A? Maybe a Stetson and cowboy boots. And a B person?\nPerhaps a sari or a Nehru jacket. Those markers were initially arbitrary—\nnothing about the object called a sari intrinsically suggests a belief that\ncows are sacred because a god tends them. And there’s no inevitable link\nbetween carnivory and a Stetson’s shape—it keeps the sun out of your\neyes and off your neck, useful whether you tend cows because you love\nsteak or because Lord Krishna tended cows. Minimal group studies show\nour propensity for generating biased Us/Thems from arbitrary\ndifferences. What we then do is link arbitrary markers to meaningful\ndifferences in values and beliefs.\ndoes it become pleasurable itself? Elegant work related to the\nmesolimbic dopamine system shows that in a substantial subset of rats,\nthe arbitrary signal itself becomes rewarding. Similarly, an arbitrary\nsymbol of an Us core value gradually takes on a life and power of its\nown, becoming the signified instead of the signifier. Thus, for example,\nthe scattering of colors and patterns on cloth that constitutes a nation’s\nflag becomes something that people will kill and die for.*\nThe strength of Us/Them-ing is shown by its emergence in kids. By\nage three to four, kids already group people by race and gender, have\nmore negative views of such Thems, and perceive other-race faces as\nbeing angrier than same-race faces.8\nAnd even earlier. Infants learn same-race faces better than other-race.\n(How can you tell? Show an infant a picture of someone repeatedly; she\nlooks at it less each time. Now show a different face—if she can’t tell the\ntwo apart, she barely glances at it. But if it’s recognized as being new,\nthere’s excitement, and longer looking).9\nFour important thoughts about kids dichotomizing:\nAre children learning these prejudices from their\nparents? Not necessarily. Kids grow in environments\nwhose nonrandom stimuli tacitly pave the way for\ndichotomizing. If an infant sees faces of only one skin\ncolor, the salient thing about the first face with a\ndifferent skin color will be the skin color.\nRacial dichotomies are formed during a crucial\ndevelopmental period. As evidence, children adopted\nbefore age eight by someone of a different race develop\nthe expertise at face recognition of the adoptive parent’s\nrace.10\nKids learn dichotomies in the absence of any ill intent.\nWhen a kindergarten teacher says, “Good morning, boys\nand girls,” the kids are being taught that dividing the\nworld that way is more meaningful than saying, “Good\nmorning, those of you who have lost a tooth and those of\nRacial Us/Them-ing can seem indelibly entrenched in\nkids because the parents most intent on preventing it are\noften lousy at it. As shown in studies, liberals are\ntypically uncomfortable discussing race with their\nchildren. Instead they counter the lure of Us/Them-ing\nwith abstractions that mean squat to kids—“It’s\nwonderful that everyone can be friends” or “Barney is\npurple, and we love Barney.”\nThus, the strength of Us/Them-ing is shown by: (a) the speed and\nminimal sensory stimuli required for the brain to process group\ndifferences; (b) the unconscious automaticity of such processes; (c) its\npresence in other primates and very young humans; and (d) the tendency\ns/Them-ing typically involves inflating the merits of Us\nconcerning core values—we are more correct, wise, moral, and\nworthy when it comes to knowing what the gods want/running the\neconomy/raising kids/fighting this war. Us-ness also involves inflating\nthe merits of our arbitrary markers, and that can take some work—\nrationalizing why our food is tastier, our music more moving, our\nlanguage more logical or poetic.\nPerhaps even more than superiority, feelings about Us center on\nshared obligations, on willingness and expectation of mutuality.12 The\nessence of an Us mind-set is nonrandom clustering producing higher-\nthan-expected frequencies of positive interactions. As we saw in chapter\n10, the logical strategy in one-round Prisoner’s Dilemma is to defect.\nCooperation flourishes when games have an uncertain number of rounds,\nand with the capacity for our reputations to precede us. Groups, by\ndefinition, have multiple-round games and the means to spread news of\nsomeone being a jerk.\nThis sense of obligation and reciprocity among Us is shown in\neconomic games, where players are more trusting, generous, and\ncooperative with in-group than with out-group members (even with\nminimal group paradigms, where players know that groupings are\narbitrary).13 Chimps even show this trust element where they have to\nchoose between (a) being guaranteed to receive some unexciting food\nand (b) getting some fabulous food if another chimp will share it with\nthem. Chimps opt for the second scenario, requiring trust, when the other\nchimp is a grooming partner.\nMoreover, priming people to think of a victim of violence as an Us,\nrather than a Them, increases the odds of their intervening. And recall\nfrom chapter 3 how fans at a soccer match are more likely to aid an\ninjured spectator if he’s wearing home-team insignias.14\nEnhanced prosociality for in-group members does not even require\nface-to-face interactions. In one study subjects from an ethnically\nIn-group obligation is shown by people feeling more need to make\namends for transgressions against an Us than against a Them. For the\nformer, people usually make amends to the wronged individual and act\nmore prosocially to the group overall. But people often make in-group\namends by being more antisocial to another group. Moreover, in such\nscenarios, the guiltier the person feels about her in-group violation, the\nworse she is to Thems.16\nThus, sometimes you help Us by directly helping Us, sometimes by\nhurting Them. This raises a broad issue about in-group parochialism: is\nthe goal that your group do well, or simply better than Them? If the\nformer, maximizing absolute levels of in-group well-being is the goal,\nand the levels of rewards to Them is irrelevant; if the latter, the goal is\nmaximizing the gap between Us and Them.\nBoth occur. Doing better rather than doing well makes sense in zero-\nsum games where, say, only one team can win, and where winning with\nscores of 1–0, 10–0, and 10–9 are equivalent. Moreover, for sectarian\nsports fans, there is similar mesolimbic dopamine activation when the\nhome team wins or when a hated rival loses to a third party.*17 This is\nschadenfreude, gloating, where their pain is your gain.\nIt’s problematic when non–zero sum games are viewed as zero-sum\n(winner-take-all).18 It’s not a great mind-set to think you’ve won World\nWar III if afterward Us have two mud huts and three fire sticks and They\nhave only one of each.* A horrific version of this thinking occurred late\nduring World War I, when the Allies knew they had more resources (i.e.,\nsoldiers) than Germany. Therefore, the British commander, Douglas\nHaig, declared a strategy of “ceaseless attrition,” where Britain went on\nthe offensive, no matter how many of his men were killed—as long as\nthe Germans lost at least as many.\nSo in-group parochialism is often more concerned about Us beating\nThem than with Us simply doing well. This is the essence of tolerating\ninequality in the name of loyalty. Consistent with that, priming loyalty\nstrengthens in-group favoritism and identification, while priming\nequality does the opposite.19\nIntertwined with in-group loyalty and favoritism is an enhanced\nsensorimotor” reflex of tensing your hand when watching a hand being\npoked with a needle; the reflex is stronger if it is a same-race hand.20\nAs we saw, people are more likely to make amends for transgressions\nagainst Us than against Them. What about responses to other in-group\nmembers violating a norm?\nMost common is forgiving Us more readily than Them. As we will\nsee, this is often rationalized—we screw up because of special\ncircumstances; They screw up because that’s how They are.\nSomething interesting can happen when someone’s transgression\nconstitutes airing the group’s dirty laundry that affirms a negative\nstereotype. The resulting in-group shame can provoke high levels of\npunishment as a signal to outsiders.21\nThe United States, with its rationalizations and ambivalences about\nethnicity, provides many such examples. Consider Rudy Giuliani, who\ngrew up in Brooklyn in an Italian American enclave dominated by\norganized crime (Giuliani’s father served time for armed robbery and\nthen worked for his brother-in-law, a Mob loan shark). Giuliani rose to\nnational prominence in 1985 as the attorney prosecuting the “Five\nFamilies” in the Mafia Commission Trial, effectively destroying them.\nHe was strongly motivated to counter the stereotype of “Italian\nAmerican” as synonymous with organized crime. When referring to his\naccomplishment, he said, “And if that’s not enough to remove the Mafia\nprejudice, then there probably could not be anything you could do to\nremove it.” If you want someone to prosecute mafiosi with tireless\nintensity, get a proud Italian American outraged by the stereotypes\ngenerated by the Mob.22\nSimilar motivations were widely ascribed to Chris Darden, the\nAfrican American attorney who was cocounsel for the prosecution in the\nO. J. Simpson trial. Ditto for the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and\nMorton Sobell, all Jewish, accused of spying for the Soviet Union. The\nvery public prosecution was by two Jews, Roy Cohn and Irving Saypol,\nand presided over by a Jewish judge, Irving Kaufman, all eager to\ncounter the stereotype of Jews as disloyal “internationalists.” After death\nsentences were doled out, Kaufman was honored by the American\nThis raises a larger issue, namely our sense of obligation and loyalty\nto Us as a whole. At one extreme it can be contractual. This can be\nliteral, with professional athletes in team sports. It is expected that when\njocks sign contracts, they will play their hardest, putting the team’s\nfortune above showboating. But the obligations are finite—they’re not\nexpected to sacrifice their lives for their team. And when athletes are\ntraded, they don’t serve as a fifth column, throwing games in their new\nuniform to benefit their old team. The core of such a contractual\nrelationship is the fungibility of both employer and employee.\nAt the other extreme, of course, are Us memberships that are not\nfungible and transcend negotiation. People aren’t traded from the Shiites\nto the Sunnis, or from the Iraqi Kurds to the Sami herders in Finland. It\nwould be a rare Kurd who would want to be Sami, and his ancestors\nwould likely turn over in their graves when he nuzzled his first reindeer.\nConverts are often subject to ferocious retribution by those they left—\nconsider Meriam Ibrahim, sentenced to death in Sudan in 2014 for\nconverting to Christianity—and suspicion from those they’ve joined.\nWith the sense of one’s lot being permanent come distinctive elements of\nUs-ness. You don’t sign a faith-based baseball contract with vague\npromises of a salary. But Us-ness based on sacred values, with wholes\nbigger than sums of parts, where unenforceable obligations stretch across\ngenerations, millennia, even into afterlives, where it’s Us, right or wrong,\nis the essence of faith-based relationships.\nNaturally, things are more complicated. Sometimes an athlete\nchoosing to switch teams is viewed as betraying a sacred trust. Consider\nthe perceived treachery when LeBron James chose to leave the Cavaliers\nof his hometown, Cleveland, and the perception of his choice to return as\nakin to the Second Coming. At the other extreme of group membership,\npeople do convert, emigrate, assimilate, and, especially in the United\nStates, wind up a pretty atypical Us—consider ex-Governor Bobby\nJindal of Louisiana, with his rich Southern accent and Christian faith,\nborn Piyush Jindal to Hindu immigrant parents from India. And consider\nthe complexities in, to use a horrible phrase, the unidirectionality of\nfungibility—Muslim fundamentalists who would execute Meriam\npeople pay taxes, obey laws, serve in the army; the government provides\nsocial services, builds roads, and helps after hurricanes. Or is it one of\nsacred values? The people give absolute obedience and the state provides\nthe myths of the Fatherland. Few such citizens can conceive that if the\nstork had arbitrarily deposited them elsewhere, they’d fervently feel the\nust as we view Us in standardized ways, there are patterns in how we\nview Them. A consistent one is viewing Them as threatening, angry,\nand untrustworthy. Take space aliens in movies, as an interesting\nexample. In an analysis of nearly a hundred pertinent movies, starting\nwith Georges Méliès’s pioneering 1902 A Trip to the Moon, nearly 80\npercent present aliens as malevolent, with the remainder either\nbenevolent or neutral.* In economic games people implicitly treat\nmembers of other races as less trustworthy or reciprocating. Whites\njudge African American faces as angrier than white faces, and racially\nambiguous faces with angry expressions are more likely to be\ncategorized as the other race. White subjects become more likely to\nsupport juvenile criminals being tried as adults when primed to think\nabout black (versus white) offenders. And the unconscious sense of\nThem as menacing can be remarkably abstract—baseball fans tend to\nunderestimate the distance to a rival team’s stadium, while Americans\nhostile to Mexican immigrants underestimate the distance to Mexico\nCity.\nBut Thems do not solely evoke a sense of menace; sometimes it’s\ndisgust. Back to the insular cortex, which in most animals is about\ngustatory disgust—biting into rotten food—but whose human portfolio\nincludes moral and aesthetic disgust. Pictures of drug addicts or the\nhomeless typically activate the insula, not the amygdala.25\nBeing disgusted by another group’s abstract beliefs isn’t naturally the\nrole of the insula, which evolved to care about disgusting tastes and\nsmells. Us/Them markers provide a stepping-stone. Feeling disgusted by\nThem because they eat repulsive, sacred, or adorable things, slather\nthemselves with rancid scents, dress in scandalous ways—these are\nthings the insula can sink its teeth into. In the words of the psychologist\nPaul Rozin of the University of Pennsylvania, “Disgust serves as an\nethnic or out-group marker.” Establishing that They eat disgusting things\nattitudes toward immigrants, foreigners, and socially deviant groups tend\nto have low thresholds for interpersonal disgust (e.g., are resistant to\nwearing a stranger’s clothes or sitting in a warm seat just vacated).27 We\nwill return to this finding in chapter 15.\nSome Thems are ridiculous, i.e., subject to ridicule and mockery,\nhumor as hostility.28 Out-groups mocking the in-group is a weapon of\nthe weak, damaging the mighty and lessening the sting of subordination.\nWhen an in-group mocks an out-group, it’s to solidify negative\nstereotypes and reify the hierarchy. In line with this, individuals with a\nhigh “social dominance orientation” (acceptance of hierarchy and group\ninequality) are most likely to enjoy jokes about out-groups.\nThems are also frequently viewed as simpler and more homogeneous\nthan Us, with simpler emotions and less sensitivity to pain. David\nBerreby, in his superb book Us and Them: The Science of Identity, gives\na striking example, namely that whether it was ancient Rome, medieval\nEngland, imperial China, or the antebellum South, the elite had the\nsystem-justifying stereotype of slaves as simple, childlike, and incapable\nof independence.29\nEssentialism is all about viewing Them as homogeneous and\ninterchangeable, the idea that while we are individuals, they have a\nmonolithic, immutable, icky essence. A long history of bad relations\nwith Thems fuels essentialist thinking—“They’ve always been like this\nand always will be.” As does having few personal interactions with\nThems—after all, the more interactions with Thems, the more exceptions\naccumulate that challenge essentialist stereotyping. But infrequency of\ninteractions is not required, as evidenced by essentialist thinking about\nthe opposite sex.30\nThus, Thems come in different flavors—threatening and angry,\ndisgusting and repellent, primitive and undifferentiated.\nThoughts Versus Feelings About Them\nHow much are our thoughts about Them post-hoc rationalizations for\ntop to justify the existing system’s unequal status quo. Cognitive\ngymnastics also occur when our negative, homogeneous view of a type\nof Them must accommodate the appealing celebrity Them, the Them\nneighbor, the Them who has saved our ass—“Ah, this Them is different”\n(no doubt followed by a self-congratulatory sense of open-\nmindedness).31\nCognitive subtlety can be needed in viewing Thems as threats.32\nBeing afraid that the Them approaching you will rob you is rife with\naffect and particularism. But fearing that those Thems will take our jobs,\nmanipulate the banks, dilute our bloodlines, make our children gay, etc.,\nrequires future-oriented cognition about economics, sociology, political\nscience, and pseudoscience.\nThus Us/Them-ing can arise from cognitive capacities to generalize,\nimagine the future, infer hidden motivations, and use language to align\nthese cognitions with other Us-es. As we saw, other primates not only\nkill individuals because they are Thems but have negative associations\nabout them as well. Nonetheless, no other primate kills over ideology,\ntheology, or aesthetics.\nDespite the importance of thought in Us/Them-ing, its core is\nemotional and automatic.33 In the words of Berreby in his book,\n“Stereotyping isn’t a case of lazy, short-cutting cognition. It isn’t\nconscious cognition at all.” Such automaticity generates statements like\n“I can’t put my finger on why, but it’s just wrong when They do that.”\nWork by Jonathan Haidt of NYU shows that in such circumstances,\ncognitions are post-hoc justifications for feelings and intuitions, to\nconvince yourself that you have indeed rationally put your finger on\nwhy.\nThe automaticity of Us/Them-ing is shown by the speed of the\namygdala and insula in making such dichotomies—the brain weighing in\naffectively precedes conscious awareness, or there never is conscious\nawareness, as with subliminal stimuli. Another measure of the affective\ncore of Them-ing is when no one even knows the basis of a prejudice.\nConsider the Cagots, a minority in France whose persecution began in\nthe eleventh century and continued well into the last one.34 Cagots were\nand thus were discriminated against by Christians. Or they might have\nbeen early Christians, and discrimination against them was started by\nnon-Christians. No one knew the sins of ancestral Cagots or how to\nrecognize Cagots beyond community knowledge. During the French\nRevolution, Cagots burned birth certificates in government offices to\ndestroy proof of their status.\nThe automaticity is seen in another way. Consider an individual with\nan impassioned hatred for an array of out-groups.35 There are two ways\nto explain this. Option 1: He has carefully concluded that group A’s trade\npolicies hurt the economy and just happens to also believe that group B’s\nancestors were blasphemous, and thinks that group C members don’t\nexpress sufficient contrition for a war started by their grandparents, and\nperceives group D members as pushy, and thinks that group E\nundermines family values. That’s a lot of cognitive just-happens-to’s.\nOption 2: The guy’s authoritarian temperament is unsettled by novelty\nand ambiguity about hierarchies; this isn’t a set of coherent cognitions.\nAs we saw in chapter 7, Theodor Adorno, in trying to understand the\nroots of fascism, formalized this authoritarian temperament. Individuals\nprejudiced against one type of out-group tend toward being prejudiced\nagainst other ones, and for affective reasons.*36 More on this in the next\nchapter.\nThe strongest evidence that abrasive Them-ing originates in emotions\nand automatic processes is that supposed rational cognitions about\nThems can be unconsciously manipulated. In an example cited earlier,\nsubjects unconsciously primed about “loyalty” sit closer to Us-es and\nfarther from Thems, while those primed about “equality” do the\nopposite.* In another study, subjects watched a slide show of basic,\nunexciting information about a country they knew nothing about\n(“There’s a country called ‘Moldova’?”). For half the subjects, faces with\npositive expressions were flashed at subliminal speeds between slides;\nfor the other half, it was negative expressions. The former developed\nmore positive views of the country than the latter.37\nConscious judgments about Thems are unconsciously manipulated in\nthe real world. In an important experiment discussed in chapter 3,\ntrain. Then commuters filled out second questionnaires.\nRemarkably, the presence of such pairs made people more supportive\nof decreasing legal immigration from Mexico and of making English the\nofficial language, and more opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants.\nThe manipulation was selective, not changing attitudes about Asian\nAmericans, African Americans, or Middle Easterners.\nHow’s this for a fascinating influence on Us/Them-ing, way below\nthe level of awareness: Chapter 4 noted that when women are ovulating,\ntheir fusiform face areas respond more to faces, with the (“emotional”)\nvmPFCs responding more to men’s faces in particular. Carlos Navarrete\nat Michigan State University has shown that white women, when\novulating, have more negative attitudes toward African American\nmen.*38 Thus the intensity of Us/Them-ing is being modulated by\nhormones. Our feelings about Thems can be shaped by subterranean\nforces we haven’t a clue about.\nAutomatic features of Us/Them-ing can extend to magical contagion,\na belief that the essentialism of people can transfer to objects or other\norganisms.39 This can be a plus or a minus—one study showed that\nwashing a sweater worn by JFK would decrease its value at auction,\nwhereas sterilizing one worn by Bernie Madoff would increase its value.\nThis is sheer irrationality—it’s not like an unwashed JFK sweater still\ncontains his magical armpit essence, while an unwashed Madoff sweater\nswarms with moral-taint cooties. And magical contagion has occurred\nelsewhere—Nazis killed supposedly contaminated “Jewish dogs” along\nwith their owners.*40\nThe heart of cognition catching up with affect is, of course,\nrationalization. A great example of this occurred in 2000, when everyone\nlearned the phrase “hanging chads” following the election of Al Gore\nand the Supreme Court’s selection of George W. Bush.* For those who\nmissed that fun, a chad is the piece of paper knocked out of a punch-card\nballot when someone votes, and a hanging chad is one that doesn’t\ncompletely detach; does this justify disqualifying the vote, even though it\nis clear who the person voted for? And obviously, if one millisecond\nbefore chads reared their hanging heads, you had asked pundits what\nopposing Thems threatened Mom, apple pie, and the legacy of the\nAlamo.\nThe “confirmation biases” used to rationalize and justify automatic\nThem-ing are numerous—remembering supportive better than opposing\nevidence; testing things in ways that can support but not negate your\nhypothesis; skeptically probing outcomes you don’t like more than ones\nyou do.\nMoreover, manipulating implicit Them-ing alters justification\nprocesses. In one study Scottish students read about a game where\nScottish participants either did or didn’t treat English participants\nunfairly. Students who read about Scots being prejudicial became more\npositive in their stereotypes about Scots and more negative about Brits—\njustifying the bias by the Scottish participants.41\nOur cognitions run to catch up with our affective selves, searching\nfor the minute factoid or plausible fabrication that explains why we hate\nThem.42\nIndividual Intergroup Interactions Versus Group\nIntergroup Interactions\nThus, we tend to think of Us as noble, loyal, and composed of\ndistinctive individuals whose failings are due to circumstance. Thems, in\ncontrast, seem disgusting, ridiculous, simple, homogeneous,\nundifferentiated, and interchangeable. All frequently backed up by\nrationalizations for our intuitions.\nThat is a picture of an individual navigating Us/Them in his mind.\nInteractions between groups tend to be more competitive and aggressive\nthan are interactions between individual Us-es and Thems. In the words\nof Reinhold Niebuhr, writing during World War II, “The group is more\narrogant, hypocritical, self-centered and more ruthless in the pursuit of\nits ends than the individual.”43\nThere is often an inverse relationship between levels of intragroup\nCrucially, is that inverse relationship causal? Must a society be\ninternally peaceful to muster the large-scale cooperation needed for\nmajor intergroup hostilities? Must a society suppress homicide to\naccomplish genocide? Or to reverse the causality, do threats from Thems\nmake societies more internally cooperative? This is a view advanced by\nING\nespite other primates displaying rudimentary abstractions of\nUs/Them-ing, humans are in a stratosphere of uniqueness. In this\nsection I consider how:\nwe all belong to multiple categories of Us, and their\nrelative importance can rapidly change;\nall Thems are not the same, and we have complex\ntaxonomies about different types of Thems and the\nresponses they evoke;\nwe can feel badly about Us/Them-ing and try to conceal\nit;\ncultural mechanisms can sharpen or soften the edges of\nour dichotomizing.\nMultiple Us-es\nI am a vertebrate, mammal, primate, ape, human, male, scientist,\nlefty, sun sneezer, Breaking Bad obsessive, and Green Bay Packers fan.*\nAll grounds for concocting an Us/Them. Crucially, which Us is most\nimportant to me constantly shifts—if some octopus moved in next door, I\nwould feel hostile superiority because I have a spine and it didn’t, but\nthat animosity might melt into a sense of kinship when I discovered that\nthe octopus, like me, loved playing Twister as a kid.\n—\nWe all belong to multiple Us/Them dichotomies. Sometimes one can be\na surrogate for another—for example, the dichotomy of people who\nexample, discussed in chapter 3, concerned math performance in Asian\nAmerican women, built around the stereotypes of Asians being good at\nmath, and women not. Half the subjects were primed to think of\nthemselves as Asian before a math test; their scores improved. Half were\nprimed about gender; scores declined. Moreover, levels of activity in\ncortical regions involved in math skills changed in parallel.*46\nWe also recognize that other individuals belong to multiple\ncategories, and shift which we consider most relevant. Not surprisingly,\nlots of that literature concerns race, with the core question being whether\nit is an Us/Them that trumps all others.\nThe primacy of race has a lot of folk-intuition appeal. First, race is a\nbiological attribute, a conspicuous fixed identity that readily prompts\nessentialist thinking.47 This also fuels intuitions about evolution—\nhumans evolved under conditions where different skin color is the\nclearest signal that someone is a distant Them. And the salience of race\nis seen cross-culturally—an astonishing percentage of cultures have\nhistorically made status distinctions by skin color, including in\ntraditional cultures before Western contact, where with few exceptions\n(e.g., the low-status Ainu ethnic minority in Japan) lighter skin tone\nconfers higher status both within and between groups.\nBut these intuitions are flimsy. First, while there are obvious\nbiological contributions to racial differences, “race” is a biological\ncontinuum rather than a discrete category—for example, unless you\ncherry-pick the data, genetic variation within race is generally as great as\nbetween races. And this really is no surprise when looking at the range of\nvariation with a racial rubric—compare Sicilians with Swedes or a\nSenegalese farmer with an Ethiopian herder.*\nThe evolutionary argument doesn’t hold up either. Racial differences,\nwhich have only relatively recently emerged, are of little Us/Them\nsignificance. For the hunter-gatherers of our hominin history, the most\ndifferent person you’d ever encounter in your life came from perhaps a\ncouple of dozen miles away, while the nearest person of a different race\nlived thousands of miles away—there is no evolutionary legacy of\nhumans encountering people of markedly different skin color.\nEuropeans; someone with one black great-grandparent and seven white\nones was classified as white in Oregon but not Florida. This is race as a\ncultural rather than biological construct.48\nGiven facts like these, it is not surprising that racial Us/Them\ndichotomies are frequently trumped by other classifications. The most\nfrequent is gender. Recall the finding that it is more difficult to\n“extinguish” a conditioned fear association with an other- than a same-\nrace face. Navarrete has shown that this occurs only when the\nconditioned faces are male; gender outweighs race as an automatic\nclassification in this case.* Age as a classification readily trumps race as\nwell. Even occupation can—for example, in one study white subjects\nshowed an automatic preference for white politicians over black athletes\nwhen they were primed to think of race, but the opposite when primed to\nthink of occupation.49\nRace as a salient Us/Them category can be shoved aside by subtle\nreclassification. In one study subjects saw pictures of individuals, each\nblack or white, each associated with a statement, and then had to recall\nwhich face went with which statement.50 There was automatic racial\ncategorization—if subjects misattributed a quote, the face picked and the\none actually associated with the statement were likely to be of the same\nrace. Next, half the black and half the white individuals pictured wore\nthe same distinctive yellow shirt; the other half wore gray. Now subjects\nmost often confused faces by shirt color.\nWonderful research by Mary Wheeler and Susan Fiske of Princeton\nshowed how categorization is shifted, studying the phenomenon of\namygdala activation by pictures of other-race faces.51 In one group\nsubjects tried to find a distinctive dot in each picture. An other-race face\ndidn’t activate the amygdala; face-ness wasn’t being processed. In a\nsecond group subjects judged whether each face looked older than some\nage. Amygdaloid responses to other-race faces enlarged—thinking\ncategorically about age strengthened thinking categorically about race. In\na third group a vegetable was displayed before each face; subjects judged\nwhether the person liked that vegetable. The amygdala didn’t respond to\nwould resemble the effect of searching for the dot.\nb. Recategorization. You look at a Them face, thinking\nabout what food they’d like. You picture the person\nshopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, sitting down\nto dinner at home and enjoying a particular food. . . . In\nother words, you think of the person as an individual.\nThis is the readily accepted interpretation.\nBut recategorization can occur in the real world under the most brutal\nand unlikely circumstances. Here are examples that I find to be intensely\npoignant:\nIn the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate general Lewis\nArmistead was mortally wounded while leading a charge. As he\nlay on the battlefield, he gave a secret Masonic sign, in hopes of\nits being recognized by a fellow Mason. It was, by a Union\nofficer, Hiram Bingham, who protected him, got him to a Union\nfield hospital, and guarded his personal effects. In an instant the\nUs/Them of Union/Confederate became less important than that\nof Mason/non-Mason.*52\nAnother shifting of Thems also occurred during the Civil War.\nBoth armies were filled with Irish immigrant soldiers; Irish\ntypically had picked sides haphazardly, joining what they\nthought would be a short conflict to gain some military training\n—useful for returning home to fight for Irish independence.\nBefore battle, Irish soldiers put identifying sprigs of green in\ntheir hats, so that, should they lie dead or dying, they’d shed the\narbitrary Us/Them of this American war and revert to the Us that\nmattered—to be recognized and aided by their fellow Irish.53 A\ngreen sprig as a green beard.\nRapid shifting of Us/Them dichotomies is seen during World\nhimself the first line (in Latin) of an ode by Horace about a\nsnowcapped mountain. At which point the British commander,\nPatrick Leigh Fermor, continued the recitation. The two men\nrealized that they had, in Leigh Fermor’s words, “drunk at the\nsame fountains.” A recategorization. Leigh Fermor had Kreipe’s\nwounds treated and personally ensured his safety through the\nremainder of the march. The two stayed in touch after the war\nand were reunited decades later on Greek television. “No hard\nfeelings,” said Kreipe, praising Leigh Fermor’s “daring\noperation.”54\nAnd finally there is the World War I Christmas truce, something\nI will consider at length in the final chapter. This is the famed\nevent where soldiers on both sides spent the day singing,\npraying, and partying together, playing soccer, and exchanging\ngifts, and soldiers up and down the lines struggled to extend the\ntruce. It took all of one day for British-versus-German to be\nsubordinated to something more important—all of us in the\ntrenches versus the officers in the rear who want us to go back to\nkilling each other.\nThus Us/Them dichotomies can wither away into being historical\ntrivia questions like the Cagots and can have their boundaries shifted at\nthe whims of a census. Most important, we have multiple dichotomies in\nour heads, and ones that seem inevitable and crucial can, under the right\ncircumstances, have their importance evaporate in an instant.\nCold and/or Incompetent\nThat both a gibbering schizophrenic homeless man and a successful\nbusinessman from a resented ethnic group can be a Them demonstrates\nsomething crucial—different types of Thems evoke different feelings in\nus, anchored in differences in the neurobiologies of fear and disgust.55\nConsider someone who pushes all our judgmental buttons—say, a\nhomeless junkie whose wife threw him out of the house because of his\nabusiveness, and who now mugs elderly people. Throw ’im under a\ntrolley—people are most likely to agree to sacrifice one to save five\nwhen the five are in-group members and the one is this extreme of an\nout-group.*56\nBut what about Thems who evoke more complex feelings?\nTremendously influential work has been done by Fiske, with her\n“stereotype content model.”57 This entire section concerns that work.\nWe tend to categorize Thems along two axes: “warmth” (is the\nindividual or group a friend or foe, benevolent or malevolent?) and\n“competence” (how effectively can the individual or group carry out\ntheir intentions?).\nThe axes are independent. Ask subjects to assess someone about\nwhom they have only minimal information. Priming them with cues\nabout the person’s status alters ratings of competence but not of warmth.\nPrime them about the person’s competitiveness and you do the opposite.\nThese two axes produce a matrix with four corners. There are groups that\nwe rate as being high in both warmth and competence—Us, naturally.\nAnd Americans typically view this group as containing good Christians,\nAfrican American professionals, and the middle class.\nAnd there’s the other extreme, low in both warmth and competence\n—our homeless, addicted mugger. Subjects typically hand out low-\nwarmth/low-competence assessments for the homeless, people on\nwelfare, and poor people of any race.\nThen there’s the high-warmth/low-competence categorization—the\nmentally disabled, people with handicaps, the elderly.* And the\ncategorization of low warmth/high competence. It’s how people in the\ndeveloping world tend to view the European culture that used to rule\nthem,* and how many minority Americans view whites. It’s the hostile\nstereotype of Asian Americans by white America, of Jews in Europe, of\nIndo-Pakistanis in East Africa, of Lebanese in West Africa, and of ethnic\nChinese in Indonesia (and, to a lesser extent, of rich people by poorer\nPeople tend toward consistent feelings evoked by each of the\nextremes. For high warmth, high competence (i.e., Us), there’s pride.\nLow warmth, high competence—envy. High warmth, low competence—\npity. Low warmth, low competence—disgust. Stick someone in a brain\nscanner, show them pictures of low-warmth/low-competence people, and\nthere’s activation of the amygdala and insula but not of the fusiform face\narea or the (emotional) vmPFC—a profile evoked by viewing disgusting\nobjects (although, once again, this pattern shifts if you get subjects to\nindividuate, asking them to think about what food this homeless person\nlikes, rather than “anything they can find in garbage cans”).* In contrast,\nviewing low-warmth/high-competence or high-warmth/low-competence\nindividuals activates the vmPFC.\nThe places between the extremes evoke their own characteristic\nresponses. Individuals who evoke a reaction between pity and pride\nevoke a desire to help them. Floating between pity and disgust is a desire\nto exclude and demean. Between pride and envy is a desire to associate,\nto derive benefits from. And between envy and disgust are our most\nhostile urges to attack.\nWhat fascinates me is when someone’s categorization changes. The\nmost straightforward ones concern shifts from high-warmth/high-\ncompetence (HH) status:\nHH to HL: This is watching a parent decline into dementia, a\nsituation evoking extremes of poignant protectiveness.\nHH to LH: This is the business partner who turns out to have been\nembezzling for decades. Betrayal.\nAnd the rare transition from HH to LL—a buddy who made partner\nin your law firm, but then “something happened” and now he’s\nhomeless. Disgust mingled with bafflement—what went wrong?\nEqually interesting are shifts from other categorizations. There’s\nwhen you shift your perception of someone from HL to LL—the janitor\nwhom you condescendingly greet each day turns out to think you’re a\njerk. Ingrate.\nThere’s the shift from LL to LH. When I was a kid in the sixties, the\nparochial American view of Japan was LL—the shadow of World War II\nThen there’s the shift from LL to HL. This is when a homeless guy\nfinds someone’s wallet and does cartwheels to return it—and you realize\nthat he’s more decent than half your friends.\nMost interesting to me is the transition from LH status to LL, which\ninvokes gloating, glee, schadenfreude. I remember a great example of\nthis in the 1970s, when Nigeria nationalized its oil industry and there\nwas the (delusionally misplaced, it turns out) belief that this would usher\nin wealth and stability. I recall a Nigerian commentator crowing that\nwithin the decade, Nigeria would be sending foreign aid to its ex–\ncolonial overlord, Great Britain (i.e., Brits would be shifting from LH to\nLL).\nThe glee explains a feature of persecution of LH out-groups, namely\nto first degrade and humiliate them to LL. During China’s Cultural\nRevolution, resented elites were first paraded in dunce caps before being\nshipped to labor camps. Nazis eliminated the mentally ill, already LL, by\nunceremoniously murdering them; in contrast, premurder treatment of\nthe LH Jews involved forcing them to wear degrading yellow armbands,\nto cut one another’s beards, to scrub sidewalks with toothbrushes before\njeering crowds. When Idi Amin expelled tens of thousands of LH Indo-\nPakistani citizens from Uganda, he first invited his army to rob, beat, and\nrape them. Turning LH Thems into LL Thems accounts for some of the\nworst human savagery.\nThese variations are sure more complicated than chimps associating\nrivals with spiders.\nOne strange human domain is the phenomenon of developing a\ngrudging respect, even a sense of camaraderie, with an enemy. This is\nthe world of the probably-apocryphal mutual respect between opposing\nWorld War I flying aces: “Ah, monsieur, if it were another time, I would\ndelight in discussing aeronautics with you over some good wine.”\n“Baron, it is an honor that it is you who shoots me out of the sky.”\nThis one’s easy to understand—these were knights, dueling to the\ngallant death, their Us-ness being their shared mastery of the new art of\naerial combat, soaring above the little people below.\nBut surprisingly, the same is shown by combatants who, instead of\ncan respect a brave, skillful, and resourceful enemy. They have people\nthey love at home, they too have to endure mud, rain and steel.”\nWhispers of Us-ness with people trying to kill you.58\nAnd then there is the even stranger world of differing feelings about\nthe economic versus the cultural enemy, the relatively new enemy versus\nthe ancient one, or the distant alien enemy versus the neighboring enemy\nwhose miniscule differences have been inflated. These are the differing\nsubjugations that the British Empire inflicted on the Irish next door\nversus on Australian aborigines. Or Ho Chi Minh, rejecting the offer of\nChinese troops on the ground during the Vietnam War, with a statement\nto the effect of “The Americans will leave in a year or a decade, but the\nChinese will stay for a thousand years if we let them in.” And what’s\nmost pertinent about byzantine Iranian geopolitics—the millennia-old\nPersian antipathy toward the Mesopotamians next door, the centuries-old\nShiite conflicts with Sunnis, or the decades-old Islamic hatred of the\nGreat Satan, the West?*\nNo discussion of the oddities of human Us/Them-ing is complete\nwithout the phenomenon of the self-hating ________ (take your pick of\nthe out-group), where out-group members buy into the negative\nstereotypes and develop favoritism for the in-group.59 This was shown\nby psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark in their famed “doll\nstudies,” begun in the 1940s. They demonstrated with shocking clarity\nthat African American children, along with white children, preferred to\nplay with white dolls over black ones, ascribing more positive attributes\n(e.g., nice, pretty) to them. That this effect was most pronounced in black\nkids in segregated schools was cited in Brown v. Board of Education.*\nRoughly 40 to 50 percent of African Americans, gays and lesbians, and\nwomen show automatic IAT biases in favor of whites, heterosexuals, and\nmen, respectively.\nSome of My Best Friends\nThe “honorable enemy” phenomenon raises another domain of\nthat he can’t distinguish between Us chimps and Them chimps. And\nthese are all commonplace in progressive Western cultures.\nYoung humans are like chimps—six-year-olds not only prefer to be\nwith kids like themselves (by whatever criteria) but readily say so. It\nisn’t until around age ten that kids learn that some feelings and thoughts\nabout Thems are expressed only at home, that communication about\nUs/Them is charged and contextual.60\nThus there can be striking discrepancies in Us/Them relations\nbetween what people claim they believe and how they act—consider\ndifferences between election poll results and election results. This is\nshown experimentally as well—in one depressing study, subjects\nclaimed they’d be very likely to proactively confront someone\nexpressing racist views; yet actual rates were far lower when they were\nunknowingly put in that position (note—this is not to say that this\nreflected racist sentiments; instead it likely reflected social-norm\ninhibitions being stronger than the subjects’ principles).61\nAttempts to control and repress Us/Them antipathies have the frontal\ncortex written all over them. As we saw, a subliminal fifty-millisecond\nexposure to the face of another can activate the amygdala, and if\nexposure is long enough for conscious detection (about five hundred\nmilliseconds or more), the initial amygdala activation is followed by\nPFC activation and amygdala damping; the more PFC activation,\nparticularly of the “cognitive” dlPFC, the more amygdala silencing. It’s\nthe PFC regulating discomfiting emotions.62\nBehavioral data also implicate the frontal cortex. For example, for\nthe same degree of implicit racial prejudice (as shown with the IAT), the\nbias is more likely to be expressed behaviorally in individuals with poor\nfrontal executive control (as shown with an abstract cognitive task).63\nChapter 2 introduced the concept of “cognitive load,” where a taxing\nfrontal executive task diminishes performance on a subsequent frontal\ntask. This occurs with Us/Them-ing. White subjects do better on certain\nbehavior tests when the tester is white as opposed to black; subjects\nwhose performance declines most dramatically in the latter scenario\nshow the greatest dlPFC activation when viewing other-race faces.64\nthey are told, “Most people perform worse [on a frontal cortical\ncognitive test] than they think they did.” Moreover, if white subjects are\nprimed with a command reeking of frontal regulation (“avoid prejudice”\nduring an interracial interaction), performance declines more than when\nthey are told to “have a positive intercultural exchange.”65\nA different type of executive control can occur in minority Thems\nwhen dealing with individuals of the dominant culture—be certain to\ninteract with them in a positive manner, to counter their assumed\nprejudice against you. In one startling study African American subjects\nwere primed to think about either racial or age prejudice, followed by an\ninteraction with someone white.66 When the prime was racial, subjects\nbecame more talkative, solicited the other person’s opinion more, smiled\nmore, and leaned forward more; the same didn’t occur when subjects\ninteracted with another African American. Think about chapter 3’s\nAfrican American grad student intentionally whistling Vivaldi each\nevening on the way home.\nTwo points are worth making about these studies about executive\ncontrol and interactions with Thems:\nFrontal cortical activation during an interracial interaction could\nreflect: (a) being prejudiced and trying to hide it; (b) being\nprejudiced and feeling bad about it; (c) feeling no prejudice and\nworking to communicate that; (d) who knows what else.\nActivation merely implies that the interracial nature of the\ninteraction is weighing on the subject (implicitly or otherwise)\nand prompting executive control.\nAs per usual, subjects in these studies were mostly university\nstudents fulfilling some Psych 101 requirement. In other words,\nindividuals of an age associated with openness to novelty,\nresiding in a privileged place where Us/Them cultural and\neconomic differences are less than in society at large, and where\nthere is not only institutionalized celebration of diversity but also\n419\nstudents of all races and ethnicities peering in microscopes plus,\nfor good measure, a cheerleader type fawning over a nerdy guy\nin a wheelchair). That even this population demonstrates more\nimplicit antipathy to Thems than they like to admit is pretty\ndepressing.\n\nUS/THEM-ING\nhat situations lessen or exacerbate Us/Them-ing? (I define\n“lessen” as decreased antipathy toward Thems and/or decreased\nperception of the size or importance of contrasts between Us and Them.\nHere are some brief summaries, a warm-up for the final two chapters.\nThe Subterranean Forces of Cuing and Priming\nSubliminally flash a picture of a hostile and/or aggressive face, and\npeople are subsequently more likely to perceive a Them as the same (an\neffect that does not occur in-group).67 Prime subjects subliminally with\nnegative stereotypes of Thems, and you exacerbate Them-ing. As noted\nin chapter 3, amygdala activation* in white subjects seeing black faces is\nincreased if rap music is playing in the background and lessened if music\nassociated with negative white stereotypes—heavy metal—is played\ninstead. Moreover, implicit racial bias is lessened after subliminal\nexposure to counterstereotypes—faces of popular celebrities of that race.\nSuch priming can work within seconds to minutes and can persist;\nfor example, the counterstereotype effect lasted at least twenty-four\nhours.68 Priming can also be extraordinarily abstract and subtle. An\nexample concerned differences in electroencephalographic (EEG)\nresponses in the brain when looking at same- versus different-race faces.\nIn the study the other-race response lessened if subjects unconsciously\nfelt they were drawing the person toward them—if they were pulling a\njoystick toward themselves (versus pushing it away) at the time.\nFinally, priming is not equally effective at altering all domains of\nThem-ing; it is easier to subliminally manipulate warmth than\ncompetence ratings.\nThese can be powerful effects. And to be more than merely semantic,\nA classic one is perspective taking, which enhances identification with\nThem. For example, in a study concerning age bias, having subjects take\nthe perspective of older individuals more effectively reduced bias than\nmerely instructing subjects to inhibit stereotypical thoughts. Another is\nto consciously focus on counterstereotypes. In one such study automatic\nsexual biases were lessened more when men were instructed to imagine a\nstrong woman with positive attributes, than when they were instructed to\nattempt stereotype suppression. Another strategy is to make implicit\nbiases explicit—show people evidence of their automatic biases. More to\ncome concerning these strategies.69\nChanging the Rank Ordering of Us/Them\nCategories\nThis refers to the multiple Us/Them dichotomies we carry and the\nease of shifting their priority—shifting automatic categorizing by race to\ncategorizing by shirt color or manipulating math performance by\nemphasizing either gender or ethnicity. Shifting which categorization is\nat the forefront isn’t necessarily a great thing and may just constitute six\nof one, half a dozen of the other—for example, among European\nAmerican men, a photograph of an Asian woman applying makeup\nmakes gender automaticity stronger than ethnic automaticity, while a\npicture of her using chopsticks does the opposite. More effective than\ngetting people to shift a Them of one category into merely another type\nof Them, of course, is to shift the Them to being perceived as an Us—\nemphasizing attributes in common.70 Which brings us to . . .\nContact\nIn the 1950s the psychologist Gordon Allport proposed “contact\ntheory.”71 Inaccurate version: if you bring Us-es and Thems together\n(say, teenagers from two hostile nations brought together in a summer\nworsen things.\nSome of those effective narrower circumstances: there are roughly\nequal numbers from each side; everyone’s treated equally and\nunambiguously; contact is lengthy and on neutral, benevolent territory;\nthere are “superordinate” goals where everyone works together on a task\nthey care about (say, the summer campers turning an overgrown meadow\ninto a soccer field).72\nEssentialism Versus Individuation\nThis harks back to two important earlier points. First, that Thems\ntend to be viewed as homogeneous, simple, and having an unchangeable\n(and negative) essence. Second, that being forced to think of a Them as\nan individual can make them seem more like an Us. Decreasing\nessentialist thinking via individuation is a powerful tool.\nOne elegant study showed this. White subjects were given a\nquestionnaire assessing the extent of their acceptance of racial\ninequalities, after being given one of two primes.73 The first bolstered\nessentialist thinking about race as invariant and homogeneous\n—“Scientists pinpoint the genetic underpinnings of race.” The other\nprime was antiessentialist—“Scientists reveal that race has no genetic\nbasis.” Being primed toward essentialism made subjects more accepting\nof racial inequalities.\nHierarchy\nPredictably, making hierarchies steeper, more consequential, or more\novert worsens Them-ing; the need for justification fuels those on top to\npour the stereotypes of, at best, high warmth/low competence or, worse,\nlow warmth/low competence onto the heads of those struggling at the\nbottom, and those on the bottom reciprocate with the simmering time\nbomb that is the perception of the ruling class as low warmth/high\ncompetence.74 Fiske has explored how those on top perceiving the\ncorrelate with more of the condescension of HL perceptions trickling\ndown. Jost has explored this in a related way, examining how myths of\n“No one has it all” can reinforce the status quo. For example, the cultural\ntrope of “poor but happy”—the poor are more carefree, more in touch\nwith and able to enjoy the simple things in life—and the myth of the rich\nas unhappy, stressed, and burdened with responsibility (think of\nmiserable, miserly Scrooge and those warm, loving Cratchits) are great\nways to keep things from changing. The trope of “poor but honest,” by\nthrowing a sop of prestige to Thems, is another great means of\nrationalizing the system.*\nIndividual differences in how people feel about hierarchy help\nexplain variation in the extent of Them-ing. This is shown in studies\nexamining social-dominance orientation (SDO: how much someone\nvalues prestige and power) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA: how\nmuch someone values centralized authority, the rule of law, and\nconvention).75 High-SDO individuals show the greatest increases in\nautomatic prejudices when feeling threatened; more acceptance of bias\nagainst low-status out-groups; if male, more tolerance of sexism. And as\ndiscussed, people high in SDO (and/or in RWA) are less bothered by\nhostile humor about out-groups.\nRelated to our all being part of multiple Us/Them dichotomies is our\nsimultaneous membership in multiple hierarchies.76 No surprise, people\nemphasize the importance of the hierarchy in which they rank highest—\nbeing captain of the company’s weekend softball team takes on more\nsignificance than the lousy, lowly nine-to-five job during the week.\nParticularly interesting are hierarchies that tend to map onto Us/Them\ncategories (for example, when race and ethnicity overlap heavily with\nsocioeconomic status). In those cases, those on top tend to emphasize the\nconvergence of the hierarchies and the importance of assimilating the\nvalues of the core hierarchy (“Why can’t they all just call themselves\n‘Americans’ instead of ‘Ethnicity-Americans’?”). Interestingly, this is a\nlocal phenomenon—whites tend to favor assimilationist, unitary\nadherence to national values while African Americans favor more\n424\nblack universities. We can keep two contradictory things in our heads at\nthe same time if that works to our benefit.\n—\nThus, in order to lessen the adverse effects of Us/Them-ing, a shopping\nlist would include emphasizing individuation and shared attributes,\nperspective taking, more benign dichotomies, lessening hierarchical\ndifferences, and bringing people together on equal terms with shared\ngoals. All to be revisited.\n\nn analogy concerning health: Stress can be bad for you. We no\nlonger die of smallpox or the plague and instead die of stress-\nrelated diseases of lifestyle, like heart disease or diabetes, where damage\nslowly accumulates over time. It is understood how stress can cause or\nworsen disease or make you more vulnerable to other risk factors. Much\nof this is even understood on the molecular level. Stress can even cause\nyour immune system to abnormally target hair follicles, causing your\nhair to turn gray.\nAll true. Yet stress researchers do not aim to eliminate, to “cure,” us\nof stress. It can’t be done, and even if it could, we wouldn’t want that—\nwe love stress when it’s the right kind; we call it “stimulation.”\nThe analogy is obvious. From massive, breathtaking barbarity to\ncountless pinpricks of microaggression, Us versus Them has produced\noceans of pain. Yet our generic goal is not to “cure” us of Us/Them\ndichotomizing. It can’t be done, unless your amygdala is destroyed, in\nwhich case everyone seems like an Us. But even if we could, we\nwouldn’t want to eliminate Us/Them-ing.\nI’m a fairly solitary person—after all, I’ve spent a significant amount\nof my life studying a different species from my own, living alone in a\ntent in Africa. Yet some of the most exquisitely happy moments of my\nlife have come from feeling like an Us, feeling accepted and not alone,\nsafe and understood, feeling part of something enveloping and larger\nthan myself, filled with a sense of being on the right side and doing both\nwell and good. There are even Us/Thems that I—eggheady, meek, and\namorphously pacifistic—would be willing to kill or die for.77\nIf we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list\nitem to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in\nmind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing\ncatch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the\nlarger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking. Individuate, individuate,\n426\nAnd in the meantime, give the right-of-way to people driving cars\nwith the “Mean people suck” bumper sticker, and remind everyone that\nwe’re all in it together against Lord Voldemort and the House Slytherin."

    "content": "Hierarchy, Obedience, and\nResistance\nt first glance, this chapter simply complements the previous one.\nUs/Them-ing is about relations between groups and our\nautomatic tendency to favor in-groups over out-groups. Similarly,\nhierarchies are about a type of relations within groups, our automatic\ntendency to favor people close in rank to us over those who are distant.\nOther themes repeat as well—the appearance of these tendencies early in\nlife and in other species, and the intertwined cognitive and affective\nunderpinnings.\nMoreover, Us/Them categorization and hierarchical position interact.\nIn one study subjects gave racial designations to pictures of racially\nambiguous individuals; those dressed in low-status attire were more\nlikely to be categorized as black, high-status attire, white.1 Thus, among\nthese American subjects, Us/Them dichotomizing by race and the\nhierarchy of socioeconomic status overlap.\nBut as we’ll see, hierarchy heads in different directions from\nUs/Them-ing, and in uniquely human ways: Like other hierarchical\nspecies, we have alpha individuals, but unlike most others, we\noccasionally get to choose them. Moreover, they often are not merely\nhighest ranking but also “lead,” attempting to maximize this thing called\nthe common good. Furthermore, individuals vie for leadership with\ndiffering visions of how best to attain that common good—political\nHIERARCHIES\nor starters, a hierarchy is a ranking system that formalizes unequal\naccess to limited resources, ranging from meat to that nebulous\nthing called “prestige.” We begin by examining hierarchies in other\nspecies (with the proviso that not all social species have hierarchies).\nThe textbook 1960s picture of hierarchies in other species was\nstraightforward. A group forms a stable, linear hierarchy where the alpha\nindividual dominates everyone, the beta individual dominates everyone\nexcept the alpha, gamma everyone except alpha and beta, and so on.\nHierarchies establish a status quo by ritualizing inequalities. Two\nbaboons encounter something good—say, a spot shaded from the sun.\nWithout stable dominance relations, there’s a potentially injurious fight.\nLikewise over the figs in a fruiting tree an hour later, and for the chance\nto be groomed by someone after that, etc. Instead, fights rarely occur,\nand if a subordinate forgets his status, a “threat yawn”—a ritualistic\ndisplay of canines—from the dominant male usually suffices.*,*2\nWhy have ranking systems? The answer, circa 1960s, was Marlin\nPerkins group selection, where a species benefits from a stable social\nsystem in which everyone knows their place. This view was fostered by\nthe primatological belief that in a hierarchy the alpha individual (i.e., the\none who gets first dibs on anything good) was in some manner a “leader”\nwho does something useful for the group. This was emphasized by the\nHarvard primatologist Irven DeVore, who reported that among savanna\nbaboons, the alpha male led the troop in each day’s direction of foraging,\nled communal hunts, defended everyone against lions, disciplined the\nkids, changed the lightbulbs, etc. This turned out to be nonsense. Alpha\nmales don’t know which direction to go (given that they transfer into\ntroops as adolescents). No one follows them anyway; instead everyone\nfollows the old females, who do know. Hunts are disorganized free-for-\nhierarchy are individualistic. Interactions that proclaim the status quo\nobviously help the upper crust. Meanwhile, for subordinates, better to\nnot get a shady spot than to not get it after receiving a canine slash. This\nis logical in a static, hereditary ranking system. In systems where ranks\nchange, this caution must be balanced with occasionally challenging\nthings—because the alpha male may be past his prime and getting by on\nbluff.\nThis is a classic “pecking order” (a term derived from the\nhierarchical system of hens). Variations begin. A first concern is whether\nthere’s actually a hierarchy, in the sense of gradations of rank. Instead, in\nsome species (e.g., South American marmoset monkeys) there’s the\nalpha and there’s everyone else, with fairly equal relations.\nIn species with gradations, there’s the issue of what a “rank” actually\nmeans. If your rank is number six in a hierarchy, in your mind are\nnumbers one through five interchangeable guys you’d better kowtow to,\nwhile seven through infinity are undifferentiated peons? If so, it would\nbe irrelevant to you if numbers two and three, or numbers nine and ten,\nhim in rank than the one five steps above. Furthermore, primates note\ngradations that don’t directly concern them. Recall from chapter 10 how\nresearchers recorded vocalizations of individuals in a troop, splicing\nthem to invent social scenarios. Play a recording of number ten giving a\ndominance call and number one responding with a subordination call,\nand everyone pays attention: whoa, Bill Gates just panhandled a\nhomeless guy.\nThis can be abstracted further, as shown with ravens, which are\noutrageously smart birds. As with baboons, vocalizations implying\ndominance reversals command more attention than does the status quo.\nRemarkably, this even occurs for reversals between birds in a\nneighboring flock. Ravens discern dominance relations just by listening\nand are interested in hierarchical gossip about a different group.\nNext is the issue of variation within and among species as to what\nlife is like having a particular rank. Does being high ranking merely\nmean that everyone keeps tabs on your mood or, at the other extreme,\nthat no one else is getting enough calories to ovulate, lactate, or survive?\nHow often do subordinates challenge dominant individuals? How readily\ndo dominant individuals vent their frustrations on subordinates? How\nmuch do such subordinates have coping outlets (e.g., someone to groom\nwith)?\nThen there is the issue of how high rank is attained. In many cases\n(e.g., female baboons, as noted) rank is inherited, a system with kin\nselection written all over it. In contrast, in other species/sexes (male\nbaboons, for example) ranks shift over time, changing as a function of\nfights, showdowns, and Shakespearean melodrama, where rising in the\nhierarchy is about brawn, sharp canines, and winning the right fight.*\nHurrah for clawing your way to the top, for sweaty, zero-sum,\nmuscular capitalism. But what about the more interesting issue of how\nhigh rank, once attained, is maintained? As we’ll see, this has less to do\nwith muscle than with social skills.\nThis ushers in a key point—social competence is challenging, and\nthis is reflected in the brain. The British anthropologist Robin Dunbar\nhas shown that across various taxa (e.g., “birds,” “ungulates” or\nthe evolutionary expansion of the neocortex have been linked. This link\nalso occurs within species. Among some primates, group size can vary\ntenfold (depending on the richness of the ecosystem). This was modeled\nin a fascinating neuroimaging study, in which captive macaque monkeys\nwere housed in different-sized groups; the bigger the group, the more\nthickening of the prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal gyrus, a\ncortical region involved in Theory of Mind, and the tighter the activity\ncoupling between the two.*3\nThus primate social complexity and big brains go together. This is\nshown further by examining fission-fusion species, where the size of the\nsocial group regularly changes dramatically. Baboons, for example, start\nand end the day in a large, coherent troop, whereas midday foraging\noccurs in small groups. As other examples, hyenas hunt in groups but\nscavenge individually, and wolves often do the opposite.\nSociality is more complex in fission-fusion species. You must\nremember if someone’s rank differs when in a subgroup versus the entire\ngroup. Being away from someone all day makes it tempting to see if\ndominance relations have changed since breakfast.\nOne study compared fission-fusion primates (chimps, bonobos,\norangutans, spider monkeys) and non-fission-fusion (gorillas, capuchins,\nlong-tailed macaques).4 Among these captive animals, fission-fusion\nspecies were better at frontocortical tasks and had larger neocortices\nrelative to total brain size. Studies of corvids (crows, ravens, magpies,\njackdaws) showed the same thing.\nThus “rank” and “hierarchy” in other animals is anything but\numan hierarchies resemble those of other species in many ways.\nFor example, there’s the distinction between stable and unstable\nhierarchies—centuries of czarist rule versus the first inning of the\nRussian Revolution. As we’ll see below, those situations evoke different\npatterns of brain activation.\nGroup size also matters—primate species with bigger social groups\nhave larger cortices relative to the rest of the brain (with humans topping\noff both measures).5 If you graph the size of the neocortex against the\naverage size of the social group across primate species, you get\n“Dunbar’s number,” the predicted average group size in traditional\nhuman cultures. It’s 150 people, and there’s much evidence supporting\nthat prediction.\nThis also plays out in the Western world, where the larger the size of\nsomeone’s social network (often calculated by the number of e-\nmail/texting relationships), the larger the vmPFC, orbital PFC, and\namygdala, and the better the person’s Theory of Mind–related skills.6\nDo these brain regions expand when someone has a larger social\nnetwork, or do larger sizes of these regions predispose people toward\nforming larger networks? Naturally, some of both.\nAs with other species, human quality of life also varies with the\nconsequences of rank inequalities—there’s a big difference between the\npowerful getting seated at a restaurant before you and the powerful\ngetting to behead you if the fancy strikes them. Recall the study of thirty-\nseven countries showing that the more income inequality, the more\npreadolescent bullying in schools. In other words, countries with more\nbrutal socioeconomic hierarchies produce children who enforce their\nown hierarchies more brutally.7\nAmid these cross-species similarities, there are unique things about\ndeciding why hierarchies where we flounder are crap and the one where\nwe reign really counts.\nImplicit in being part of multiple hierarchies is their potential\noverlap. Consider socioeconomic status, which encompasses both local\nand global hierarchies. I’m doing great socioeconomically—my car’s\nfancier than yours. I’m doing terribly—I’m not richer than Bill Gates.\nThe Specialization of Some Ranking Systems\nA high-ranking chimp is generally good at related things. But\nhumans can dwell in incredibly specialized hierarchies. Example:\nThere’s a guy named Joey Chestnut who’s a god in one subculture—he’s\nthe most successful competitive hot dog eater in history. However,\nwhether Chestnut’s gift generalizes to other domains is unclear.\nInternal Standards\nThis is the circumstance of having internal standards independent of\nthe outside world. As an example, winning or losing at a team sport\ngenerally increases or decreases, respectively, testosterone levels in men.\nBut things are subtler than that—testosterone more closely tracks\nwinning through skill (rather than luck), and also more closely tracks\nindividual (rather than team) performance.8\n—\nDetecting Rank\nMuch as with our ability to detect Thems, we’re intensely interested\nin and adept at spotting rank differences. For example, forty milliseconds\nis all we need to reliably distinguish between a dominant face (with\ndirect gaze) and a subordinate one (with averted gaze and lowered\neyebrows). Status is also signaled in the body, albeit to a less accurate\nextent—dominance with an exposed torso with arms wide open,\nsubordination with arms sheltering a bent torso, intent on invisibility.\nAgain, we recognize those cues at automatic speeds.9\nHuman infants also recognize status differences, as shown in a truly\nclever study. Show an infant a computer screen displaying a big square\nand little square; each has eyes and a mouth.10 The two squares are at\nopposite ends of the screen and repeatedly move to the other side,\npassing each other in the process. Then show a version where the two\nbump into each other—conflict. The squares bump repeatedly until one\nof them “gives in” by lying down, letting the other one pass. Toddlers\nlook at the interaction longer when it’s the big square that gives in, rather\nthan the little one. The first scenario is more interesting because it\nviolates expectations—“Hey, I thought big squares dominated little\nsquares.” Just like monkeys and corvids.\nBut wait, this may just reflect folk physics, not attunement to\nhierarchy—big things knock over little things, not the other way around.\nThis confound was eliminated. First, the adversarial squares were not\ntouching when one gave in. Second, the subordinating one would fall in\nthe opposite direction from that predicted by physics—rather than being\nknocked backward, it prostrates itself before the alpha square.\nAlong with this expertise comes intense interest in hierarchy—as\nemphasized in chapter 9, gossip is mostly about the status of status: Are\nthere any fallen mighty? Have the meek inherited anything lately?\ninterest. Those monkeys and corvids not only pay attention when there\nare rank reversals in their group; they do the same when eavesdropping\non the neighbors. Same with us.11\nWhat’s happening in our brains when we contemplate rank?12\nNaturally, the prefrontal cortex weighs in. Frontal damage impairs skill\nat recognizing dominance relations (along with recognizing kinship,\ndeception, or intimacy in faces). The vlPFC and dlPFC activate and\nbecome coupled when we figure out dominance relations or look at a\ndominant face, reflecting the combined affective and cognitive\ncomponents to the process. These responses are most pronounced when\nconsidering someone of the opposite sex (which may reflect mating\ngoals more than mere academic interest about hierarchy).\nSeeing a dominant face also activates the superior temporal gyrus\n(STG, with its role in Theory of Mind) and increases its coupling to the\nPFC—we’re more interested in what dominant individuals are\nthinking.13 Moreover, individual “social status” neurons occur in the\nmonkeys. And as noted in chapter 2, contemplating an unstable hierarchy\ndoes all of the above, plus activates the amygdala, reflecting the\nunsettling effects of instability. Of course, though, none of this tells us\nwhat we are contemplating at these times.\nYour Brain and Your Own Status\nYour own rank does logical things to your brain. In macaque\nmonkeys an increase in rank increases mesolimbic dopamine signaling.\nAnd back to that rhesus monkey study showing that being in a larger\nsocial group causes expansion and functional coupling of the STG and\nPFC. The study also showed that the higher the rank attained within each\ngroup, the greater the expansion and coupling. Consistent with that, a\nstudy of mice showed that higher-ranking animals had stronger\nexcitatory inputs into the mouse equivalent of the (cognitive) dlPFC.14\nI love these findings. As I said, in lots of social species, attaining\nDoes the monkey make history, or does history make the monkey?\nOnce groups were formed, did individuals who became dominant\nrespond with the biggest expansions of those brain regions? Or, prior to\ngroup formation, were the individuals destined to become dominant\nalready endowed in those regions?\nUnfortunately, animals weren’t imaged before and after group\nformation in the study. However, subsequent work showed that the larger\nthe size of the group, the larger the association between dominance and\nthose brain changes, suggesting that attaining high rank drives the\nenlargement.* In contrast, the mouse study showed that when synaptic\nexcitability was increased or decreased in the dlPFC, rank rose or\ndeclined, respectively, suggesting that enlargement drives attainment of\nhigh rank. The brain can shape behavior can shape the brain can\nshape . . .15\nYour Body and Your Own Status\nWhat about biological differences outside the brain as a function of\nrank? For example, do high- and low-ranking males differ in their\ntestosterone profiles and, if there are differences, are they causes,\nconsequences, or mere correlates of the rank differences?\nFolk endocrinology has always held that high rank (in any species)\nand elevated testosterone levels go hand in hand, with the latter powering\nthe former. But as covered at length in chapter 4, neither is the case in\nprimates. As a reminder:\nIn stable hierarchies high-ranking males typically don’t\nhave the highest testosterone concentrations. Instead it’s\nusually low-ranking adolescent males, starting fights\nthey can’t finish. When there is an association between\nhigh rank and high testosterone, it generally reflects the\nhigher rates of sexual behavior among dominant\nindividuals driving secretion.\nDuring unstable times, the high-testosterone/high-rank\nrelationship is more a consequence of the high rates of\nfighting among the high-ranking cohort than of rank\nitself.16\nReiterating the “challenge hypothesis,” the elevation in\ntestosterone levels caused by fighting is not so much\nabout aggression as about challenge. If status is\nmaintained aggressively, testosterone fosters aggression;\nif status were maintained by writing beautiful, delicate\nhaikus, testosterone would foster that.\nNext we consider the relationship between rank and stress. Are\ndifferent ranks associated with different levels of stress hormones, styles\nof coping, and incidences of stress-related disease? Is it more stressful to\nbe dominant or subordinate?\nAn extensive literature shows that a sense of control and\npredictability reduces stress. Yet monkey research conducted by Joseph\nBrady in 1958 produced a different view. Half the animals could press a\nbar to delay shocks (“executive” monkeys); the passive other half\nreceived a shock whenever the executive did. And the executive\nmonkeys, with their control and predictability, were more likely to\nulcerate. This birthed the “executive stress syndrome”—those on top are\nburdened with the stressors of control, leadership, and responsibility.17\nExecutive stress syndrome became a meme. But a huge problem was\nthat monkeys were not randomly assigned to be “executives” and\n“nonexecutives.” Instead, those that pressed the bar soonest in pilot\nstudies were made executives.* Such monkeys were subsequently shown\nto be more emotionally reactive, so Brady had inadvertently stacked the\nexecutive side with the ulcer-prone neurotics.\nSo much for ulcerating executives; contemporary studies show that\nthe worst stress-related health typically occurs in middle management,\nwith its killer combo of high work demands but little autonomy—\nresponsibility without control.\nBy the 1970s dogma held that subordinate organisms are the most\nobserved in primates ranging from rhesus monkeys to lemurs. Same for\nhamsters, guinea pigs, wolves, rabbits, and pigs. Even fish. Even sugar\ngliders, whatever they are. In a pair of unintentional studies of captive\nmonkeys in which subordinate individuals were basically subordinated to\ndeath, such animals had extensive damage to the hippocampus, a brain\nregion very sensitive to the damaging effects of glucocorticoid excess.18\nMy own work with baboons in Africa showed the same (being the\nfirst such studies of wild primates). In general, low-ranking male\nbaboons had elevated basal glucocorticoid levels. When something\nstressful did occur, their glucocorticoid stress response was relatively\nsluggish. When the stressor was over, their levels returned to that\nelevated baseline more slowly. In other words, too much of the stuff in\nthe bloodstream when you don’t need it, and too little when you do.\nRemarkably, at the nuts-and-bolts level of brain, pituitary, and adrenals,\nthe elevated basal glucocorticoid levels of a subordinate occurred for the\nsame reasons as the elevated levels in humans with major depression.\nFor a baboon, social subordination resembles the learned helplessness of\ndepression.\nExcessive glucocorticoids get you into trouble in various ways,\nhelping explain why chronic stress makes you sick. Subordinate baboons\npaid a price in other realms as well. They had (a) elevated blood pressure\nand a sluggish cardiovascular response to a stressor; (b) lower levels of\n“good” HDL cholesterol; (c) subtle immune impairments, a higher\nfrequency of getting sick and slower wound healing; (d) a testicular\nsystem more easily disrupted by stress than that of dominant males; and\n(e) lower circulating levels of a key growth factor. Try not to be a\nsubordinate baboon.\nChickens and eggs reappear—does a particular physiological\nattribute contribute to rank, or the reverse? This is impossible to\ndetermine in wild animals, but in captive primate populations the\ndistinctive physiological features of a rank generally follow, rather than\nprecede, the establishment of the rank.19\nAt that point I’d happily proclaim that these findings reflected the\nThey found the familiar picture, namely of subordination associated with\nelevated basal glucocorticoid levels. However, unexpectedly, levels in\nalphas were elevated into the range seen in lowest-ranking males. Why is\nlife more stressful for alpha than beta males? The two ranks had similar\nrates of being challenged by lower-ranking males (a source of stress) and\nbeing groomed by females (a source of coping). However, alpha males\nfight more often and spend more time in sexual consortships with\nfemales (which is majorly stressful, as the male has to defend his\nconsortship from harassing males). Ironically, a chief benefit of\nalphadom—sexual consortships—can be a major stressor. Be careful\nwhat you wish for.20\nModified from R. Sapolsky, “Sympathy for the CEO,” Sci 333 (2011): 293.\nVisit bit.ly/2ngWthp for a larger version of this graph.\nOkay, so except for the curse of being alpha, social subordination is\ngenerally stressful. But this is also wrong. It’s not just the rank that\nmatters but what the rank means.\nsubordinates; (b) subordinates lack coping outlets (such as a grooming\npartner); and/or (c) the social structure is such that subordinate animals\nhave no relatives present. And when the profile was the opposite, it was\ndominant animals with the highest glucocorticoid levels.21\nThe “meaning” of rank and its physiological correlates also vary\nbetween different groups of the same species. For example, while health\nof subordinate baboons fared particularly badly in a troop with high rates\nof dominant males displacing aggression, the health of dominant males\nfared badly in a troop during a period of instability centered around the\ntop of the hierarchy.\nAnd superimposed on all this, personality shapes the perception of\nthe reality of rank. Using the word “personality” about other species used\nto cost you tenure, but it’s now a hot topic in primatology. Individuals in\nother species have stable differences in temperament—how likely\nsomeone is to displace aggression when frustrated, how socially\naffiliative they are, how rattled they get by novelty, and so on. Primates\ndiffer as to whether they see watering holes as half empty or full; in the\ncontext of hierarchy, some individuals who are number two care only\nthat they’re not number one, and some individuals who are number nine\ngain comfort from at least not being number ten.\nNot surprisingly, personality influences the rank/health relationship.\nFor the same high rank, an individual is likely to be less healthy if he (a)\nis particularly reactive to novelty; (b) sees threats in benign\ncircumstances (e.g., his rival showing up and merely taking a nap\nnearby); (c) doesn’t take advantage of social control (e.g., letting a rival\ndetermine the start of an obvious showdown); (d) doesn’t differentiate\nbetween good and bad news (e.g., distinguishing behaviorally between\nwinning and losing a fight); and/or (e) doesn’t have social outlets when\nfrustrated. You could make a living giving baboons “how to succeed in\nbusiness” seminars built around these factors.22\nMeanwhile, on the flip side, for the same low rank, an individual\ntends to be healthier if (a) he has lots of grooming relationships; and/or\n(b) there’s someone even lower ranking than him to serve as a target for\ndisplaced aggression.\nAnd Us\nA smidgen of neurobiology research has examined differences in\nhow people feel about hierarchy. Back to a concept from the last chapter,\nsocial-dominance orientation (SDO), the measure of how much people\nvalue power and prestige. In one study subjects viewed someone in\nemotional pain. As reviewed in chapter 2, this activates the anterior\ncingulate cortex and insular cortex—empathy, and disgust at the\ncircumstance that evoked the pain. The higher someone’s SDO score, the\nless activation of those two regions. Those with the most interest in\nprestige and power seem least likely to feel for those less fortunate.23\nWhat about the biological correlates of a human having a particular\nrank? In some ways we’re more subtle than other primates; in others, far\nless so.\nTwo studies examined high-status individuals in government or the\nmilitary (in the latter case, officers up to the level of colonel). As\ncompared with low-status controls, these folks had lower basal\nglucocorticoid levels, less self-reported anxiety, and an enhanced sense\nof control (this telling us nothing, however, as to which came first—the\nrank or the unstressed profile).24\nBaboons redux. But something subtler was happening. The authors\ndeconstructed high rank with three questions: (a) How many people\nranked lower than the subject in his organization? (b) How much\nautonomy did he have (e.g., to hire and fire)? (c) How many people did\nhe directly supervise? And high rank came with low glucocorticoids and\nanxiety only insofar as the position was about the first two variables—\nlots of subordinates, lots of authority. In contrast, having to directly\nsupervise lots of subordinates did not predict those good outcomes.\nThis gives credence to executives’ bellyaching about how they aren’t\nsupervising eleventy people; instead they have eleventy bosses. To\naccrue the full physiological benefits of high status, don’t supervise\npeople; instead, glide through the workplace like a master of the universe\nstatus any primate has invented, namely socioeconomic status (SES).\nNumerous studies examine the “health/SES” gradient, the fact that life\nexpectancy and the incidence and morbidity of numerous diseases are\nworse in poor people.\nTo summarize this sprawling topic that was reviewed in chapter 9:\nWhich comes first—poverty or poor health?\nOverwhelmingly the former. Recall that developing in a\nlow-SES womb makes poorer health as an adult more\nlikely.\nIt’s not that the poor have poor health and everyone else\nis equally healthy. For every step down the SES ladder,\nhealth is worse.\nThe problem isn’t that poor people have less health-care\naccess. The gradient occurs in countries with socialized\nmedicine and universal health care and for diseases\nwhose incidence is independent of health-care access.\nOnly about a third of the variability is explained by the\npoor being exposed to more health risk factors (e.g.,\npollution) and fewer protective factors (e.g., health club\nmemberships).\nThe gradient seems to be about the psychological\nbaggage of SES. (a) Subjective SES predicts health at\nleast as accurately as objective SES, meaning that it’s\nnot about being poor. It’s about feeling poor. (b)\nIndependent of absolute levels of income, the more\nincome inequality in a community—meaning the more\nfrequently the poor have their noses rubbed in their low\nstatus—the steeper the health gradient. (c) Lots of\ninequality in a community makes for low social capital\n(trust and a sense of efficacy), and that’s the most direct\ncause of the poor health. Collectively these studies show\nthat the psychological stress of low SES is what\nThe SES/health gradient is ubiquitous. Regardless of gender, age, or\nrace. With or without universal health care. In societies that are\nethnically homogeneous and those rife with ethnic tensions. In societies\nin which the central mythology is a capitalist credo of “Living well is the\nbest revenge” and those in which it is a socialist anthem of “From each\naccording to his ability, to each according to his need.” When humans\ninvented material inequality, they came up with a way of subjugating the\nlow ranking like nothing ever before seen in the primate world.\nA Really Odd Thing That We Do Now and Then\nAmid the unique features of human hierarchies, one of the most\ndistinctive and recent is this business of having leaders and choosing\nwho they are.\nAs discussed, outdated primatology confused high rank with\n“leadership” in silly ways. An alpha male baboon is not a leader; he just\ngets the best stuff. And while everyone follows a knowledgeable old\nfemale when she chooses her foraging route in the morning, there is\nevery indication that she is “going” rather than “leading.”\nBut humans have leaders, anchored in the unique notion of the\ncommon good. What counts as the common good, and the leader’s role\nin fostering it, obviously varies, ranging from leading the horde in the\nsiege of a castle to leading a bird-watching walk.\nEven more newfangled is humans choosing their leaders, whether\nselecting a clan head by acclamation around the campfire, or a three-\nyear-long presidential campaign season topped with the bizarreness of\nthe Electoral College. How do we choose leaders?\nA frequent conscious component of decision making is to vote for\nexperience or competence rather than for stances on specific issues. This\nis so common that in one study faces judged to look more competent\nwon elections 68 percent of the time.26 People also make conscious\nvoting choices based on single, potentially irrelevant issues (e.g., voting\npundits suggested that people’s choice for the most powerful position on\nearth should reflect which guy you’d rather have a beer with.\nAt least as interesting are the automatic and unconscious elements of\ndecision making. As probably the strongest factor, of candidates with\nidentical political stances, people are more likely to vote for the better-\nlooking one. Given the preponderance of male candidates and\nofficeholders, this mostly translates into voting for masculine traits—tall,\nhealthy-looking, symmetrical features, high forehead, prominent brow\nridges, jutting jaw.27\nAs first raised in chapter 3, this fits into the larger phenomenon of\nattractive people typically being rated as having better personalities and\nhigher moral standards and as being kinder, more honest, more friendly,\nand more trustworthy. And they are treated better—for the same résumé,\nbeing more likely to be hired; for the same job, getting a higher salary;\nfor the same crime, being less likely to be convicted. This is the beauty-\nis-good stereotype, summarized in an 1882 quote by Friedrich Schiller:\n“Physical beauty is the sign of an interior beauty, a spiritual and moral\nbeauty.”28 This is the flip side of the view that disfigurement, illness, and\ninjury are karmic payback for one’s sins. And as we saw in chapter 3, we\nuse the same circuitry in the orbitofrontal PFC when we evaluate the\nmoral goodness of an act and the beauty of a face.\nOther implicit factors come into play. One study examined the\ncampaign speeches of candidates in every prime minister election in\nAustralian history.29 In 80 percent of elections the winner was the one to\nuse more collective pronouns (i.e., “we” and “us”), suggesting an\nattraction to candidates who speak on everyone’s behalf.\nThere are also contingent automatic preferences. For example, in\nscenarios concerning war, both Western and East Asian subjects prefer\ncandidates with older, more masculine faces; during peacetime, it’s\nyounger, more feminine faces. Furthermore, in scenarios involving\nfostering cooperation between groups, intelligent-looking faces are\npreferred; at other times more intelligent faces are viewed as less\nmasculine or desirable.30\nThese automatic biases fall into place early in life. One study showed\nScientists doing these studies often speculate as to why such\npreferences have evolved; frankly, much of this feels like just-so stories.\nFor example, in analyzing the preference for leaders with more\nmasculine faces during war, the authors noted that high testosterone\nlevels produce both more masculine facial features (generally true) and\nmore aggressive behavior (not true, back to chapter 4), and that\naggressiveness is what you want in a leader during times of war\n(personally, not so sure about that one). Thus, preferring candidates with\nmore masculine faces increases the odds of landing the aggressive leader\nyou need to triumph in war. And everyone then passes on more copies of\ntheir genes. Voilà.\nRegardless of causes, the main point is the power of these forces—\nfive-year-olds with 71 percent accuracy demonstrate that these are some\nPOLITICS AND POLITICAL\nORIENTATIONS\no humans keep getting weirder—multiple hierarchies and having\nleaders and occasionally choosing them and doing so with some\nsilly, implicit criteria. Now let’s plunge into politics.\nFrans de Waal introduced the term “politics” into primatology with\nhis classic book Chimpanzee Politics, using it in the sense of\n“Machiavellian intelligence”—nonhuman primates struggling in socially\ncomplex manners to control access to resources. The book documents\nchimpanzee genius for such maneuvering.\nThis is “politics” in the traditional human sense as well. But I will\nuse a more restricted, starry-eyed sense, which is politics being the\nstruggle among the powerful with differing visions of the common good.\nForget liberals accusing conservatives of waging war on the poor. Ditto\nconservatives accusing those depraved liberals of destroying family\nvalues. Cutting through this posturing, we’ll assume that everyone\nequally desires that people do as well as possible, but differs as to how\nbest to accomplish this. In this section we’ll focus on three issues:\na. Do political orientations tend to be internally consistent\n(e.g., do people’s opinions about their town’s littering\npolicy and about military actions in Somewhere-istan\ncome as an ideological package)? Quick answer:\nusually.\nb. Do such consistent orientations arise from deep, implicit\nfactors with remarkably little to do with specific\npolitical issues? Yup.\nc. Can one begin to detect the bits of biology underlying\neconomic grounds are likelier than chance to dislike another group on\nhistorical grounds, another on cultural, and so on.32 Much the same is\ntrue here—social, economic, environmental, and international political\norientations tend to come in a package. This consistency explains the\nhumor behind a New Yorker cartoon (pointed out by the political\npsychologist John Jost) showing a woman modeling a dress for her\nhusband and asking, “Does this dress make me look Republican?”\nAnother example concerns the bioethicist Leon Kass, who not only has\nhad influential conservative stances on human cloning, finding the\npossibility “repugnant,” but also finds it repugnant when people display\nthe “catlike activity” of licking ice cream cones in public. More to come\non his issues, including with licking ice cream cones. What this internal\nconsistency suggests is that political ideology is merely one\nmanifestation of broader, underlying ideology—as we’ll see, this helps\nexplain conservatives being more likely than liberals to have cleaning\nsupplies in their bedrooms.\nNaturally, strict consistency in political ideology isn’t always the\nrule. Libertarians are a mixture of social liberalism and economic\nconservatism; conversely, black Baptist churches are traditionally\neconomically liberal but socially conservative (for example, rejecting\nboth gay rights and the idea that gay rights are a form of civil rights).\nMoreover, neither extreme of political ideology is monolithic (and\nignoring that, I’ll be simplifying throughout by using “liberal” and “left-\nwing” interchangeably, as well as “conservative” and “right-wing”).\nNonetheless, the building blocks of political orientation tend to be\nstable and internally consistent. It’s usually possible to dress like a\nRepublican or lick ice cream like a Democrat.\nImplicit Factors Underlying Political Orientation\nIf political ideology is but one manifestation of larger internal forces\npertinent to everything from cleaning supplies in the bedroom to ice\ncream consumption, are there psychological, affective, cognitive, and\nvisceral ways in which leftists and rightists tend to differ? This question\nwith Theodor Adorno in the 1950s, people have suggested that lower\nintelligence predicts adherence to conservative ideology.33 Some but not\nall studies since then have supported this conclusion. More consistent\nhas been a link between lower intelligence and a subtype of\nconservatism, namely right-wing authoritarianism (RWA, a fondness for\nhierarchy). One particularly thorough demonstration of this involved\nmore than fifteen thousand subjects in the UK and United States;\nimportantly, the links among low IQ, RWA, and intergroup prejudice\nwere there after controlling for education and socioeconomic status. The\nstandard, convincing explanation for the link is that RWA provides\nsimple answers, ideal for people with poor abstract reasoning skills.\nINTELLECTUAL STYLE\nThis literature has two broad themes. One is that rightists are\nrelatively uncomfortable intellectually with ambiguity; this is covered\nbelow. The other is that leftists, well, think harder, have a greater\ncapacity for what the political scientist Philip Tetlock of the University\nof Pennsylvania calls “integrative complexity.”\nIn one study conservatives and liberals, when asked about the causes\nof poverty, both tended toward personal attributions (“They’re poor\nbecause they’re lazy”). But only if they had to make snap judgments.\nGive people more time, and liberals shifted toward situational\nexplanations (“Wait, things are stacked against the poor”). In other\nwords, conservatives start gut and stay gut; liberals go from gut to\nhead.34\nThis differing attributional style extends way beyond politics. Tell\nliberals or conservatives about a guy who trips over someone’s feet while\nlearning a dance, ask for a snap assessment, and everyone does personal\nattribution—the guy’s clumsy. It’s only with time that the liberals go\nsituational—maybe the dance is really difficult.\nObviously this dichotomy isn’t perfect. Rightists did personal\nattribution for Lewinsky-gate (Bill Clinton’s rotten) while leftists did\nsituational (it’s a vast right-wing conspiracy), and things ran the opposite\nwith Nixon and Watergate. However, they are pretty reliable.\nto push toward situational explanations.\nWhy? Some have suggested it’s a greater respect for thinking, which\nreadily becomes an unhelpful tautology. Linda Skitka of the University\nof Illinois emphasizes how the personal attributions of snap judgments\nreadily feel dissonant to liberals, at odds with their principles; thus they\nare motivated to think their way to a more consonant view. In contrast,\neven with more time, conservatives don’t become more situational,\nbecause there’s no dissonance.\nProportion of rulings in favor of the prisoner s by ordinal position. Circled points indicate\nthe first decision in each of the three decision sessions; tick marks on x axis denote every\nthird case; dotted line denotes food break. Because unequal session lengths resulted in a low\nnumber of cases for some of the later ordinal positions, the graph is based on the first 95%\nof the data from each session.\nWhile logical, this just turfs us to asking where the liberal ideology\ncausing the dissonance comes from in the first place. As we’ll see, it\ncomes from factors having little to do with cognitive style.\nThese findings suggest that it’s easier to make a liberal think like a\nconservative than the other way around.35 Or, stated in a familiar way,\nalcohol levels rise.\nRecall from chapter 3 that willpower takes metabolic power, thanks\nto the glucose demands of the frontal cortex. This was the finding that\nwhen people are hungry, they become less generous in economic games.\nA real-world example of this is startling (see graph on previous page)—\nin a study of more than 1,100 judicial rulings, prisoners were granted\nparole at about a 60 percent rate when judges had recently eaten, and at\nessentially a 0 percent rate just before judges ate (note also the overall\ndecline over the course of a tiring day). Justice may be blind, but she’s\nsure sensitive to her stomach gurgling.36\nMORAL COGNITION\nAnother minefield. Surprise, people at both ends of the political\nspectrum accuse the other side of impoverished moral thought.37 One\ndirection of this is seemingly bolstered by chapter 7’s Kohlberg stages of\nmoral development. Liberals, steeped in civil disobedience, tend to be at\na “higher” Kohlberg stage than are conservatives, with their fondness for\nlaw and order. Are rightists less intellectually capable of reasoning at a\nmore advanced Kohlberg stage, or are they less motivated to do so?\nSeemingly the latter—rightists and leftists are equally capable of\npresenting the other’s perspective.\nJonathan Haidt of NYU provides a very different view.38 He\nidentifies six foundations of morality—care versus harm; fairness versus\ncheating; liberty versus oppression; loyalty versus betrayal; authority\nversus subversion; sanctity versus degradation. Both experimental and\nreal-world data show that liberals preferentially value the first three\ngoals, namely care, fairness, and liberty (and, showing an overlap with\nKohlbergian formulations, undervaluing loyalty, authority, and sanctity is\nin many ways synonymous with postconventional thinking). In contrast,\nconservatives heavily value loyalty, authority, and sanctity. Obviously,\nthis is a big difference. Is it okay to criticize your group to outsiders?\nRightists: no, that’s disloyal. Leftists: yes, if justified. Should you ever\ndisobey a law? Rightists: no, that undermines authority. Leftists: of\ninstead discount fairness in favor of expedient authority, generating the\nclassical conservative view that some socioeconomic inequality is a\ntolerable price for things running smoothly.\nWhat does it mean that, in Haidt’s view, conservatives count up six\n(moral foundations) on their toes and liberals only three? Here is where\ninternecine sniping starts. Conservatives embrace Haidt’s\ncharacterization of liberals as being morally impoverished, with half\ntheir moral foundations atrophied.* The opposite interpretation,\nespoused by Jost, and Joshua Greene of Harvard, is that liberals have\nmore refined moral foundations, having jettisoned the less important,\nmore historically damaging ones that conservatives perseverate on—in\neffect, liberals count from one to three, while conservatives really only\ncount four to six.\nWhy are conservatives more concerned with “binding foundations”\nlike loyalty, authority, and sanctity, often stepping-stones to right-wing\nauthoritarianism and social-dominance orientation? This segues to the\nnext section.\nAFFECTIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES\nResearch consistently shows that leftists and rightists differ in\noverlapping categories of emotional makeup. To summarize: on the\naverage, rightists are made more anxious by ambiguity and have a\nstronger need for closure, dislike novelty, are more comforted by\nstructure and hierarchy, more readily perceive circumstances as\nthreatening, and are more parochial in their empathy.\nThe conservative dislike of ambiguity has been demonstrated in\nnumerous apolitical contexts (e.g., responses to visual illusions, taste in\nentertainment) and is closely related to the differing feelings about\nnovelty, which by definition evokes ambiguity and uncertainty.39 The\ndiffering views of novelty certainly explain the liberal view that with\ncorrect reforms, our best days are ahead of us in a novel future, whereas\nconservatives view our best days as behind us, in familiar circumstances\nthat should be returned to, to make things great again. Once again, these\ninsights into a puzzling feature of the political landscape: how is it that\nover the last fifty years, Republicans have persuaded impoverished white\nAmericans to so often vote against their own economic self-interest? Do\nthey actually believe that they’re going to win the lottery and then get to\nenjoy the privileged side of American inequality? Nah. The\npsychological issues of needing structured familiarity show that for poor\nwhites, voting Republican constitutes an implicit act of system\njustification and risk aversion. Better to resist change and deal with the\ndevil that you know. Harking back to the last chapter, gay conservatives\nshow more implicit antigay biases than do gay liberals. Better to hate\nwho you are, if that bolsters a system whose stability and predictability\nare sources of comfort.\nIntertwined with these variables is the Left/Right difference in\ntendency to see things as threatening, particularly when conservatism is\nanchored in authoritarianism. Life is filled with ambiguity, most of all\nwith the novel future, and if those make you anxious, lots of things will\nseem threatening. Now, a “threat” can be abstract, such as to your self-\nesteem; there are few political differences in the perception of such\nthreats. The differences concern concrete threats to your keister.\nThis helps explain political stances—“I have a list here of two\nhundred communist spies working in the State Department” is a pretty\ngood demonstration of imagined threat.* The difference in threat\nperception can be apolitical. In one study subjects had to rapidly do a\ntask when a word flashed up on a screen. Authoritarian conservatives,\nbut not liberals, responded more rapidly to threatening words like\n“cancer,” “snake,” or “mugger” than to nonthreatening words (e.g.,\n“telescope,” “tree,” “canteen”). Moreover, as compared with liberals,\nsuch conservatives are more likely to associate “arms” with “weapons”\n(rather than with “legs”), more likely to interpret ambiguous faces as\nthreatening, and more easily conditioned to associate negative (but not\npositive) stimuli with neutral stimuli. Republicans report three times as\nmany nightmares as do Democrats, particularly ones involving loss of\npersonal power. As the saying goes, a conservative is a liberal who has\nbeen mugged.\nThese differences in threat perception help explain the differing\nviews as to role of government—providing for people (the leftist view;\nsocial services, education, etc.) or protecting people (the rightist view;\nlaw and order, the military, etc.).*\nFear, anxiety, the terror of mortality—it must be a drag being right-\nwing. But despite that, in a multinational study, rightists were happier\nthan leftists.42 Why? Perhaps it’s having simpler answers, unburdened by\nmotivated correction. Or, as favored by the authors, because system\njustification allows conservatives to rationalize and be less discomfited\nby inequality. And as economic inequality rises, the happiness gap\nbetween the Right and the Left increases.\nAs emphasized, political ideology is just one manifestation of\nintellectual and emotional style. As a great example, a four-year-old’s\nopenness to a new toy predicts how open she’ll be as an adult to, say, the\nUnited States forging new relations with Iran or Cuba.43\nAnd of Course, Some Underlying Biology\nWe’ve now seen that political orientation is usually stable and\ninternally consistent across a range of disparate issues, and that it is\ntypically merely one manifestation of a package of cognitive and\naffective style. Stepping deeper, what are the biological correlates of\ndiffering political orientations?\nBack to the insular cortex and its role in mediating gustatory and\nolfactory disgust in mammals and in mediating moral disgust in humans.\nRecall from the last chapter how you can reliably stoke hatred of Thems\nby making them seem viscerally disgusting. When people’s insulae\nactivate at the thought of Thems, you can check one thing off your\ngenocide to-do list.\nThis recalls a remarkable finding—stick subjects in a room with a\nsmelly garbage can, and they become more socially conservative.44 If\nyour insula is gagging from the smell of dead fish, you’re more likely to\nsubjects were exposed to either positively or negatively charged\nemotional images,* and galvanic skin resistance (GSR, an indirect\nmeasure of sympathetic nervous system arousal) was measured. The\nbiggest autonomic responses to negative (but not positive) emotional\nimages were in conservatives opposed to gay marriage or premarital sex\n(while GSR response was unrelated to nonsocial issues like free trade or\ngun control). Concerns about hygiene and purity sure predict valuing of\nsanctity.45\nRelated to that, when confronted with something viscerally\ndisturbing, conservatives are less likely to use reappraisal strategies (e.g.,\nwhen seeing something gory, thinking, “This isn’t real; it’s staged”).\nMoreover, when conservatives, but not liberals, are instructed to use\nreappraisal techniques (e.g., “Try to view the images in a detached,\nunemotional way”), they express less conservative political sentiments.\nIn contrast, a suppression strategy (“Don’t let your feelings show when\nyou’re looking at this image”) doesn’t work. As we saw, make a liberal\ntired, hungry, rushed, distracted, or disgusted, and they become more\nconservative. Make a conservative more detached about something\nviscerally disturbing, and they become more liberal.46\nThus political orientation about social issues reflects sensitivity to\nvisceral disgust and strategies for coping with such disgust. In addition,\nconservatives are more likely to think that disgust is a good metric for\ndeciding whether something is moral. Which recalls Leon Kass, the\nbioethicist with the ice cream–licking issues. He headed George W.\nBush’s bioethics panel, one that, thanks to Kass’s antiabortion ideology,\ngreatly restricted embryonic stem cell research. Kass has argued for what\nhe calls “the wisdom of repugnance,” where disgust at something like\nhuman cloning can be “the emotional expression of deep wisdom,\nbeyond wisdom’s power completely to articulate it.” The visceral level,\nwith or without post-hoc rationalization, is all you need in order to know\nwhat’s right. If it makes you puke, then you must rebuke.47\nThe monumental flaw is obvious. Different things disgust different\npeople; whose gag reflex wins? Moreover, things once viewed as\ndisgusting are viewed differently now (e.g., the idea of slaves having the\nThus issues anchored in the insula help explain differences in\npolitical orientation; this point will be returned to in chapter 17.48\nAdditional neurobiological differences have been demonstrated.\nLiberalism has been associated with larger amounts of gray matter in the\ncingulate cortex (with its involvement in empathy), whereas\nconservatism has been associated with an enlarged amygdala (with, of\ncourse, its starring role in threat perception). Moreover, there’s more\namygdala activation in conservatives than in liberals when viewing a\ndisgusting image or doing a risky task.\nBut not all the findings fit easily. For example, when looking at\ndisgusting images, conservatives also show relatively greater activation\nof a hodgepodge of other brain regions—the basal ganglia, thalamus,\nperiaqueductal gray, (cognitive) dlPFC, middle/superior temporal gyrus,\npresupplementary motor, fusiform, and inferior frontal gyrus. How all\nthose fit together isn’t clear.\nNaturally, one must ask: have behavior geneticists reported genetic\ninfluences on political orientation? Twin studies report heritability of\nabout 50 percent for political orientation. Genomewide survey\napproaches have identified genes whose polymorphic variants were\nassociated with political orientation. Most of the genes had no known\nfunctions, or were previously thought to be unrelated to the brain; those\nwhose brain-related functions were known (for example, one coded for a\nreceptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate) don’t teach much about\npolitical orientation. As an interesting gene/environment interaction, the\n“risk-taking” version of the D4 dopamine receptor gene is associated\nwith liberals—but only in people with lots of friends. Moreover, some\nstudies show a genetic association with people’s likelihood of voting,\nindependent of political orientation.49\nInteresting. However, the approach comes with all of chapter 8’s\ncaveats—most findings haven’t been replicated, reported effects are\nsmall, and these are published in political science journals rather than\ngenetics journals. Finally, to the extent that genes are related to political\nDISOBEDIENCE AND NONCONFORMITY\no humans have multiple simultaneous hierarchies and hierarchies\nbuilt around abstractions, and occasionally choose leaders who\nlabor for the common good.50 Add to that obedience to leaders. This is\nutterly different from a schlub of a baboon obediently surrendering his\nspot in the shade to the looming alpha male. Instead humans show\nobedience to authority that transcends any given occupant of a throne\n(the king is dead; long live the king), to the very notion of authority. Its\nelements range from loyalty, admiration, and emulation to brownnosing,\nsycophancy, and instrumental self-interest, and can range from mere\ncompliance (i.e., the public conformity of going along, without actually\nagreeing) to drinking the Kool-Aid (i.e., identifying with the authority\nand internalizing and extending its beliefs).\nObedience is closely intertwined with conformity, a concept central\nto the previous chapter but considered here. Both consist of going along;\nthe former with the group, the latter with authority. And for us the\ncommonalities are what matter. Moreover, the opposites—disobedience\nand nonconformity—are also intertwined and range from the\nindependence of marching to a different drummer to the intentionality\nand mirrored determinism of anticonformity.\nImportantly, these are value-free terms. Conformity can be great—\nit’s helpful if everyone in a culture agrees on whether shaking your head\nup and down means yes or no. Conforming is necessary for the benefits\nof the wisdom of the crowd. And it can be truly comforting. But\nobviously conformity can be horrendous—joining in on bullying,\noppressing, shunning, expelling, killing, just because everyone else is on\nboard.\nObedience can be swell too, ranging from everyone stopping at stop\nsigns to (to the embarrassment of my pseudoanarchist adolescence) my\nRoots\nConformity and obedience have deep roots, as evidenced by their\npresence in other species and in very young humans.\nAnimal conformity is a type of social learning—a subordinate\nprimate does not have to be thrashed by some bruiser in order to express\nsubordination to him; everyone else’s doing so can be sufficient.*51 The\nconformity has a familiar human tinge to it. For example, a chimp is\nmore likely to copy an action if he sees three other individuals do it once\neach than if one other individual does it three times.* Moreover, learning\ncan include “cultural transmission”—in chimps, for example, this\nincludes learning types of tool construction. Conformity relates to social\nand emotional contagion where, say, a primate aggressively targets an\nindividual just because someone else is already doing so. Such contagion\neven works between groups. For example, among marmosets aggression\nin a group becomes more likely if aggressive vocalizations are heard\nfrom the neighboring group. Other primates are even subject to the social\ncontagion of yawning.*52\nMy favorite example of nonhuman conformity is so familiar that it\ncould come right out of high school. A male grouse courts a female who,\nalas, doesn’t feel magic in the air and rebuffs him. The researchers then\nmake him seem like the hottest stud on the prairie—by surrounding him\nwith some rapt, stuffed female grouse. Soon the reluctant maiden is all\nover him, pushing her statuesque rivals aside.53\nAn even clearer demonstration of animal conformity was shown in a\nbeautiful study of chimpanzees by Frans de Waal. In each of two groups\nthe alpha female was separated from the rest and shown how to open a\npuzzle box containing food. Crucially, the two were shown different,\nequally difficult ways of doing it. Once the females had mastered their\napproaches, the chimps in each group got to watch their alpha female\nstrut her stuff repeatedly with the puzzle box. Finally everyone got\naccess to the puzzle box and promptly copied their alpha’s technique.54\nbecause everyone else was doing so.* The same phenomenon was\nsubsequently shown in capuchin monkeys and wild birds.\nThus animals will perform one version of a behavior not because it is\nbetter but simply because everyone else does. Even more striking, animal\nconformity can be detrimental. In a 2013 study Andrew Whiten of the\nUniversity of St Andrews presented wild vervet monkeys with two bins\nof maize, dyed either pink or blue.55 One color tasted fine; the other had\na bitter additive. The monkeys learned to avoid the latter and months\nlater still ate only the “safe”-colored maize—even after the additive was\nomitted.\nAs infants were born or adults who had grown up elsewhere migrated\ninto the group, they conformed to this food choice, learning to eat only\nthe same color food as everyone else. In other words, forgoing half the\npotential food just because of the need to fit in—monkeys joining the\nherd, acting like sheep, going over the cliff like lemmings. One example\nstarkly displays the same in humans: in life-threatening emergencies\n(e.g., a restaurant fire), people frequently attempt to escape by following\nthe crowd in what they know to be the wrong direction.\nThe deeply ingrained nature of human conformity and obedience in\nhumans is shown by the ages when they are apparent. As detailed in\nchapter 7, zillions of pages have been written about conformity and peer\npressure in kids. One study nicely demonstrates the continuity of\nconformity between us and other species. This was the report that a\nchimp was more likely to conform to the behaviors of three individuals\ndoing a behavior once each than to one individual doing the behavior\nthree times. The study showed the same in two-year-old humans.\nThe depths of human conformity and obedience are shown by the\nspeed with which they occur—it takes less than 200 milliseconds for\nyour brain to register that the group has picked a different answer from\nyours, and less than 380 milliseconds for a profile of activation that\npredicts changing your opinion. Our brains are biased to get along by\ninformative ways.\nThe influential “social identity theory” posits that our concept of who\nwe are is heavily shaped by social context—by the groups we do or don’t\nidentify with.*57 In that view, conformity and obedience, while certainly\nabout avoiding punishment, are at least as much about the positives of\nfitting in. When we imitate someone’s actions, our mesolimbic dopamine\nsystem activates.* When we choose incorrectly in a task, the\ndopaminergic decline is less if we made the decision as part of a group\nthan if we did so as an individual. Belonging is safety.\nIn numerous studies a subject in a group answers some question,\nfinds out after that—oh no!—everyone else disagrees, and can then\nchange their answer.58 No surprise, the discovery that you are out of step\nactivates the amygdala and insular cortex; the more activation, the\ngreater your likelihood of changing your mind, and the more persistent\nthe change (as opposed to the transient change of compliant public\nconformity). This is a profoundly social phenomenon—people are more\nlikely to change their answer if you show them a picture of the person(s)\nwho disagrees with them.\nWhen you get the news that everyone else disagrees with you, there\nis also activation of the (emotional) vmPFC, the anterior cingulate\ncortex, and the nucleus accumbens. This is a network mobilized during\nreinforcement learning, where you learn to modify your behavior when\nthere is a mismatch between what you expected to happen and what\nactually did. Find out that everyone disagrees with you and this network\nactivates. What is it basically telling you? Not just that you’re different\nfrom everyone else. That you’re wrong. Being different = being wrong.\nThe greater the activation of this circuit, the greater the likelihood of\nchanging answers to conform.59\nLike most of the neuroimaging literature, these studies are merely\ncorrelative. Thus, particularly important is a 2011 study that used\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation techniques to temporarily inactivate\nthe vmPFC; subjects became less likely to change their answer to\nconform.60\nBack to the contrast between conforming taking the form of “You\nmemory—the revisionism involves you literally revising your memory.\nRemarkably, in another study this process of conforming was also\nassociated with activation of the occipital cortex, the brain region that\ndoes the primary processing of vision—you can almost hear the frontal\nand limbic parts of the brain trying to convince the occipital cortex that it\nsaw something different from what it actually saw. As has been said,\nwinners (in this case, in the court of public opinion) get to write the\nhistory books, and everyone else better revise theirs accordingly. War is\npeace. Freedom is slavery. That dot you saw was actually blue, not red.61\nThus the neurobiology of conforming consists of a first wave of\nanxiety where we equate differentness with wrongness, followed by the\ncognitive work needed to change our opinion. These findings obviously\ncome from an artificial world of psych experiments. Thus they’re only a\nfaint whisper of what occurs when it’s you against the rest of the jury,\nwhen it’s you being urged to join the lynch mob, when it’s you choosing\nbetween conforming and being deeply lonely.\nWhat is the neurobiology of obedience to authority, when you’re\nbeing ordered to do something wrong? A similar mixture as with\nconformity, with the vmPFC and the dlPFC mud-wrestling, with indices\nof anxiety and glucocorticoid stress hormones showing up to bias you\ntoward subordination. Which leads us to consider classic studies of “just\nfollowing orders.”\nAsch, Milgram, and Zimbardo\nThe neurobiology of conformity and obedience won’t soon be\nrevealing much about the core question in this field: if the circumstances\nare right, is every human capable of doing something appalling simply\nbecause they’ve been ordered to, because everyone else is doing it?\nIt is virtually required by law to discuss three of the most influential,\ndaring, disturbing, and controversial studies in the history of psychology,\nnamely the conformity experiments of Solomon Asch, the\nvolunteer, thinking that this was a study of perception, would be given a\npair of cards. One card would have a line on it, the other a trio of\ndifferent-length lines, one of which matched the length of the singleton\nline. Which line of the trio is the same length as the singleton? Easy;\nvolunteers sitting alone in a room had about a 1 percent error rate over a\nseries of cases.\nMeanwhile, the volunteers in the experimental group take the test in\na room with seven others, each saying his choice out loud. Unbeknownst\nto the volunteer, the other seven worked on the project. The volunteer\nwould “just happen” to go last, and the first seven would unanimously\npick a glaringly wrong answer. Stunningly, volunteers would now agree\nwith that incorrect answer about a third of the time, something replicated\nfrequently in the cottage industry of research spawned by Asch. Whether\ndue to the person’s actually changing their mind or their merely deciding\nto go along, this was a startling demonstration of conformity.\n—\nOn to the Milgram obedience experiment, whose first incarnations\nappeared in the early 1960s at Yale.63 A pair of volunteers would show\nup for a psychology “study of memory”; one would arbitrarily be\ndesignated the “teacher,” the other the “learner.” Learner and teacher\nwould be in separate rooms, hearing but not seeing each other. In the\nroom with the teacher would be the lab-coated scientist supervising the\nstudy.\nThe teacher would recite pairs of words (from a list given by the\nscientist); the learner was supposed to remember their pairing. After a\nseries of these, the teacher would test the learner’s memory of the\npairings. Each time the learner made a mistake, the teacher was supposed\nto shock them; with each mistake, shock intensity increased, up to a life-\nthreatening 450 volts, ending the session.\nTeachers thought the shocks were real—at the start they’d been given\na real shock, supposedly of the intensity of the first punitive one. It hurt.\nIn reality no punitive shocks were given—the “learner” worked on the\nproject. As the intensity of the supposed shocks increased, the teacher\nseemingly having passed out.)\nAmid the screams of pain, teachers would typically become hesitant,\nat which point they’d be urged on by the scientist with commands of\nincreasing intensity: “Please continue.” “The experiment requires that\nyou continue.” “It is absolutely essential that you continue.” “You have\nno other choice. You must go on.” And, the scientist assured them, they\nweren’t responsible; the learner had been informed of the risks.\nAnd the famed result was that most volunteers complied, shocking\nthe learner repeatedly. Teachers would typically try to stop, argue with\nthe scientist, would even weep in distress—but would obey. In the\noriginal study, horrifically, 65 percent of them administered the\nmaximum shock of 450 volts.\n—\nAnd then there’s the Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE), carried out by\nZimbardo in 1971.64 Twenty-four young male volunteers, mostly college\nstudents, were randomly split into a group of twelve “prisoners” and\ntwelve “guards.” The prisoners were to spend seven to fourteen days\njailed in a pseudoprison in the basement of Stanford’s psychology\ndepartment. The guards were to keep order.\nTremendous effort went into making the SPE realistic. The future\nprisoners thought they were scheduled to show up at the building at a\nparticular time to start the study. Instead, Palo Alto police helped\nZimbardo by showing up earlier at each prisoner’s home, arresting him,\nand taking him to the police station for booking—fingerprinting, mug\nshots, the works. Prisoners were then deposited in the “prison,” strip-\nsearched, given prison garb, along with stocking hats to simulate their\nheads being shaved, and dumped as trios in cells.\nThe guards, in surplus military khakis, batons, and reflective\nsunglasses, ruled. They had been informed that while there was no\nviolence allowed, they could make the prisoners feel bored, afraid,\nhelpless, humiliated, and without a sense of privacy or individuality.\nAnd the result was just as famously horrific as that of the Milgram\nexperiment. The guards put prisoners through pointless, humiliating\nname. The prisoners, meanwhile, had a range of responses. One cell\nrevolted on the second day, refusing to obey the guards and barricading\nthe entrance to their cell; guards subdued them with fire extinguishers.\nOther prisoners resisted more individualistically; most eventually sank\ninto passivity and despair.\nThe experiment ended famously. Six days into it, as the brutality and\ndegradation worsened, Zimbardo was persuaded to halt the study by a\ngraduate student, Christina Maslach. They later married.\nSituational Forces and What Lurks in All of Us\nThese studies are famed, have inspired movies and novels, have\nentered the common culture (with predictably horrendous\nmisrepresentations).*65 They brought renown and notoriety to Asch,\nMilgram, and Zimbardo.* And they were vastly influential in scientific\ncircles—according to Google Scholar, Asch’s work is cited more than\n4,000 times in the literature, Milgram’s more than 27,000 times, the SPE\nmore than 58,000.*66 The number of times your average science paper is\ncited can be counted on one hand, with most of the citations by the\nscientist’s mother. The trio is a cornerstone of social psychology. In the\nwords of Harvard psychologist Mahzarin Banaji, “The primary simple\nlesson the SPE [and, by extension, Asch and Milgram] teaches is that\nsituations matter” (her emphasis).\nWhat did they show? Thanks to Asch, that average people will go\nalong with absurdly incorrect assertions in the name of conformity. And\nthanks to the other two studies, that average people will do stunningly\nbad things in the name of obedience and conformity.\nThe larger implications of this are enormous. Asch and Milgram (the\nformer a Jewish Eastern European immigrant, the latter the son of Jewish\nEastern European immigrants) worked in the era of the intellectual\nchallenge of making sense of Germans “just following orders.”\nMilgram’s study was prompted by the start, a few months earlier, of the\nwar-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, the man who famously epitomized\nAmerican soldiers.*67\nZimbardo took a particularly extreme stance as to what these findings\nmean, namely his “bad barrel” theory—the issue isn’t how a few bad\napples can ruin the whole barrel; it’s how a bad barrel can turn any apple\nbad. In another apt metaphor, rather than concentrating on one evil\nperson at a time, what Zimbardo calls a “medical” approach, one must\nunderstand how some environments cause epidemics of evil, a “public\nhealth” approach. As he states: “Any deed, for good or evil, that any\nhuman being has ever done, you and I could also do—given the same\nsituational forces.” Anyone could potentially be an abusive Milgram\nteacher, Zimbardo guard, or goose-stepping Nazi. In a similar vein,\nMilgram stated, “If a system of death camps were set up in the US of the\nsorts we had seen in Nazi Germany one would be able to find sufficient\npersonnel for those camps in any medium-sized American town.” And as\nstated by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in The Gulag Archipelago, in a quote\nperpetually cited in this literature, “The line dividing good and evil cuts\nthrough the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a\npiece of his own heart?”68\nSome Different Takes\nBig surprise—the studies and their conclusions, especially those of\nMilgram and Zimbardo, have been controversial. Those two attracted\nfirestorms of controversy because of the unethical nature of the work;\nsome teachers and guards were psychological wrecks afterward, seeing\nwhat they had proven capable of;* it changed the course of a number of\ntheir lives.* No human-subjects committee would approve the Milgram\nstudy these days; in contemporary versions subjects are ordered to, for\nexample, say increasingly insulting things to the learner or administer\nvirtual shocks, evoking virtual pain, in avatars (stay tuned).69\nThe controversies about the science itself in the Milgram and\nZimbardo studies are more pertinent. The Milgram edifice has been\nrecordings of sessions, finding that teachers refused to\nshock much more frequently than reported. However,\ndespite the seemingly inflated results, the finding of\nroughly 60 percent compliance rates has been\nreplicated.70\nFew of the replicating studies were traditional academic\nones published in peer-reviewed journals. Instead most\nhave been re-creations for films and television\nprograms.\nPerhaps most important, as analyzed by Perry, far more\nteachers than Milgram indicated realized that the learner\nwas an actor and that there were no actual shocks. This\nproblem probably extends to the replications as well.\nThe SPE has arguably attracted the most controversy.\nThe biggest lightning rod was the role of Zimbardo\nhimself. Rather than being a detached observer, he\nserved as the prison’s “superintendent.” He set the\nground rules (e.g., telling guards that they could make\nthe prisoners feel afraid and helpless) and met regularly\nwith the guards throughout. He was clearly excited as\nhell to see what was happening in the study. Zimbardo is\na larger-than-life force of nature, someone whom you’d\nvery much wish to please. Thus guards were subject to\npressure not only to conform with their cohort but also\nto obey and please Zimbardo; his role, consciously or\notherwise, almost certainly prompted the guards to more\nextreme behavior. Zimbardo, a humane, decent man who\nis a friend and colleague, has written at length about this\ndistortive impact that he had on the study.\nAt the beginning of the study, volunteers were randomly\nassigned to be guards or prisoners, and the resulting two\ngroups did not differ on various personality measures.\nads. The first described “a psychological study of prison\nlife”—the words used in the advertisement for the SPE\n—while in the other the word “prison” was omitted. The\ntwo groups of volunteers then underwent personality\ntesting. Importantly, volunteers for the “prison” study\nscored higher than the others on measures of\naggressiveness, authoritarianism, and social dominance\nand lower for empathy and altruism. Insofar as both\nguards and prisoners in the SPE might have had this\nmakeup, it’s not clear why that would have biased\ntoward the famously brutal outcome.71\nFinally, there’s science’s gold standard, independent\nreplication. If you redid the SPE, down to matching the\nbrand of the guards’ socks, would you get the same\nresult? Any study this big, idiosyncratic, and expensive\nwould be difficult to match perfectly in the replication\nattempt. Moreover, Zimbardo actually published\nremarkably little of the data about the SPE in\nprofessional journals; instead he mostly wrote for the lay\npublic (hard to resist, given the attention the study\ngarnered). Thus there’s only really been one attempted\nreplication.\nThe 2001 “BBC Prison Study” was run by two respected British\npsychologists, Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews and\nAlex Haslam of the University of Exeter.72 As the name implies, it was\ncarried out (i.e., among other things, paid for) by the BBC, which filmed\nit for a documentary. Its design replicated the broad features of the SPE.\nAs is so often the case, there was a completely different outcome. To\nsummarize a book’s worth of complex events:\nPrisoners organized to resist any abuse by the guards.\nPrisoner morale soared while guards became\ndemoralized and divided.\none ex-guard overthrew the utopians and instituted a\ndraconian regime; fascinatingly, those four had scored\nhighest on scales of authoritarianism before the study\nbegan. As the new regime settled into repressive power,\nthe study was terminated.\nThus, rather than a replication of the SPE, this wound up being more\nlike a replication of the FRE and the RRE (i.e., the French Revolution\nand the Russian Revolution): a hierarchical regime is overthrown by wet-\nnosed idealists who know all the songs from Les Mis, who are then\ndevoured by Bolsheviks or Reign of Terror–ists. Importantly, the ruling\njunta at the end having entered the study with the strongest\npredispositions toward authoritarianism certainly suggests bad apples\nrather than bad barrels.\nEven bigger surprise—stop the presses—Zimbardo criticized the\nstudy, arguing that its structure invalidated it as a chance to replicate the\nSPE; that guard/prisoner assignments could not have really been random;\nand that filming made this a TV spectacle rather than science; and\nasking, how can this be a model for anything when the prisoners take\nover the prison?73\nNaturally, Reicher and Haslam disagreed with his disagreement,\npointing out that prisoners have de facto taken over some prisons, such\nas the Maze in Northern Ireland, which the Brits filled with IRA political\nprisoners, and the Robben Island prison, in which Nelson Mandela spent\nhis endless years.\nZimbardo called Reicher and Haslam “scientifically irresponsible”\nand “fraudulent.” They pulled out all the stops by quoting Foucault:\n“Where there is [coercive] power there is resistance.”\nLet’s calm down. Amid the controversies over Milgram and the SPE,\ntwo deeply vital things are indisputable:\nWhen pressured to conform and obey, a far higher\npercentage of perfectly normal people than most would\npredict succumb and do awful things. Contemporary\nNonetheless, there are always those who resist.\nThis second finding is no surprise, given Hutus who died shielding\nTutsi neighbors from Hutu death squads, Germans with every\nopportunity to look the other way who risked everything to save people\nfrom the Nazis, the informant who exposed Abu Ghraib. Some apples,\neven in the worst of barrels, do not go bad.*\nThus what becomes vital is to understand the circumstances that push\nus toward actions we thought we were far better than or that reveal\nstrength we never suspected we had.\nModulators of the Pressures to Conform and Obey\nThe end of the previous chapter examined factors that lessen\nUs/Them dichotomizing. These included becoming aware of implicit,\nautomatic biases; becoming aware of our sensitivity to disgust,\nresentment, and envy; recognizing the multiplicity of Us/Them\ndichotomies that we harbor and emphasizing ones in which a Them\nbecomes an Us; contact with a Them under the right circumstances;\nresisting essentialism; perspective taking; and, most of all, individuating\nThems.\nSimilar factors decrease the likelihood of people doing appalling\nthings in the name of conformity or obedience. These include:\nTHE NATURE OF THE AUTHORITY OR GROUP PRESSING FOR\nCONFORMITY\nDoes the authority(s) evoke veneration, identification, pants-wetting\nterror? Is the authority in close proximity? Milgram follow-ups showed\nthat when the authority (i.e., the scientist) was in a different room,\ncompliance decreased. Does the authority come cloaked in prestige?\nWhen the experiment was conducted in some nondescript warehouse in\nNew Haven, instead of on the Yale campus, compliance declined. And,\nas emphasized by Tajfel in his writing, is the authority perceived as\nes evoke more conformity than do groups of Thems. Consider the\ninvoking of Us in Konrad Lorenz’s attempt to justify becoming a Nazi:\n“Practically all my friends and teachers did so, including my own father\nwho certainly was a kindly and humane man.”75\nWith groups, issues of numbers come into play—how many other\nvoices are urging you to join the cool kids? Recall how among chimps or\ntwo-year-old humans, one individual doing something three times does\nnot evoke the conformity of three individuals doing the same act once\neach. Echoing this, follow-up studies by Asch showed that conformity\nfirst kicks in when there are at least three people unanimously\ncontradicting what the subject thinks, with maximum conformity first\nevoked by around half a dozen contradictors. But this is the artificial\nworld of lab subjects judging the length of a line—in the real world the\nconforming power of a lynch mob of six doesn’t approach that of a mob\nof a thousand.76\nWHAT IS BEING REQUIRED AND IN WHAT CONTEXT\nTwo issues stand out. The first is the persuasive power of the\nincremental. “You were okay shocking the guy with 225 volts, but not\nwith 226? That’s illogical.” “Come on, we’re all boycotting their\nbusinesses. Let’s shut them down; it’s not like anyone patronizes them.\nCome on, we’ve shut down their businesses, let’s loot them; it’s not like\nthe stores are doing them any good.” We rarely have a rational\nexplanation for an intuitive sense that a line has been crossed on a\ncontinuum. What incrementalism does is put the potential resister on the\ndefensive, making the savagery seem like an issue of rationality rather\nthan of morality. This represents an ironic inversion of our tendency to\nthink in categories, to irrationally inflate the importance of an arbitrary\nboundary. The descent into savagery can be so incremental as to come\nwith nothing but arbitrary boundaries, and our descent becomes like the\nproverbial frog cooked alive without noticing. When your conscience\nfinally rebels and draws a line in the sand, we know that it is likely to be\nan arbitrary one, fueled by implicit subterranean forces—despite your\nbest attempts at pseudospeciation, this victim’s face reminds you of a\nThe second issue concerns responsibility. When debriefed afterward,\ncompliant teachers typically cited how persuasive they found the\ninformation that the learner had been informed of the risks and had given\nconsent. “Don’t worry, you won’t be held responsible.” The Milgram\nphenomenon also showed the coercive power of misdirecting\nresponsibility, when researchers would seek compliance by emphasizing\nthat the teacher’s responsibility was to the project, not the learner—“I\nthought you said you were here to help.” “You’re a team member.”\n“You’re ruining things.” “You signed a form.” It’s hard enough to\nrespond with “This isn’t the job I signed up for.” It’s that much harder\nwhen the fine print reveals that this is what you signed up for.\nCompliance increases when guilt is diffused—even if I hadn’t done\nit, it still would have happened.77 Statistical guilt. This is why,\nhistorically, people were not executed with five shots fired from one gun.\nInstead there were five guns fired simultaneously—a firing squad. Firing\nsquads traditionally took the diffusion of responsibility a step further,\nwhere one member was randomly given a blank instead of a real bullet.\nThat way, a shooter could shift from the comforting irrationality that “I\nonly one fifth killed him” to the even better “I may not even have shot\nhim.” This tradition was translated into modern execution technology.\nLethal injection machines used in prison executions come with a dual\ncontrol system—two syringes, each filled with a lethal dose, two\nseparate delivery systems, two buttons pressed simultaneously by two\ndifferent people—at which point a random binary generator would\nsecretly determine which syringe was emptied into a bucket and which\nindividual efforts at anonymity—during the Chicago riots of 1968, many\npolice notoriously covered their name tags before setting on the unarmed\nantiwar demonstrators. Groups also facilitate conformity by\ninstitutionalizing anonymity; examples range from the KKK to Star\nWars’ Imperial Storm Troopers to the finding that in traditional human\nsocieties, warriors who transform and standardize their appearance\nbefore battle are more likely to torture and mutilate their enemies than\nwarriors from cultures that don’t transform themselves. All use means to\ndeindividuate, where the goal may not be to ensure that a victimized\nThem won’t be able to recognize you afterward as much as to facilitate\nmoral disengagement so that you won’t be able to recognize you\nMilgram follow-ups, compliance declined if the learner was in the same\nroom as the teacher and would plummet if the two had shaken hands.\nDitto if psychological distance was shortened by perspective taking—\nwhat would it feel like if you were in their shoes?\nPredictably, compliance is also decreased when the victim is\nindividuated.79 However, don’t let the authority individuate victims for\nyou. In one classic Milgram-esque study, the scientists would\n“accidentally” allow a teacher to overhear their opinion of the learner.\n“Seems like a nice guy” versus “This guy seems like an animal.” Guess\nwho’d get more shocks?\nAuthorities rarely ask us to administer shocks to those whom they\nlabel as nice guys. It’s always to the animals. Implicit in the latter\ncategorization’s evoking more compliance is our having ceded power to\nthe authorities or to the group to create the narrative. One of the greatest\nwellsprings of resistance is to seize back the narrative. From “children of\nexceptionalities” to the Paralympics, from gay-pride marches to “never\nagain,” from Hispanic Heritage Month to James Brown singing, “Say It\nOut Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud,” a major step toward victims’\nresistance is to gain the power to define themselves.\nTHINGS BROUGHT TO THE TABLE BY THE PERSON BEING PRESSURED\nSome personality traits predict resistance to the pressure to comply:\nnot valuing being conscientious or agreeable; being low in neuroticism;\nscoring low on right-wing authoritarianism (any particular authority is\nmore likely to be questioned if you already question the very concept of\nauthority); social intelligence, which may be mediated by an enhanced\nability to understand things like scapegoating or ulterior motives. And\nwhere these individual differences come from is, of course, the end\nproduct of most of the preceding chapters.80\nWhat about gender? Milgram-like studies have shown that women\naverage higher rates than men of voicing resistance to the demands to\nobey . . . but higher rates, nonetheless, of ultimately complying. Other\nstudies show that women have higher rates than men of public\nconformity and lower rates of private conformity. Overall, though,\nFinally, of course, we are the products of our culture. In broad cross-\ncultural surveys, Milgram and others showed more compliance in\nsubjects from collectivist than from individualist cultures.82\nSTRESS\nExactly as with Us/Them-ing, people are more likely to conform and\nobey at times of stress, ranging from time pressure to a real or imagined\noutside threat to a novel context. In stressful settings rules gain power.\nALTERNATIVES\nFinally, there is the key issue of whether you perceive alternatives to\nthe actions demanded of you. It can be a solitary task to reframe and\nreappraise a situation, to make the implicit explicit, to engage in\nperspective taking, to question. To imagine that resistance is not futile.\nA huge help in doing that is evidence that you are not alone. From\nAsch and Milgram on, it’s clear that the presence of anyone else pushing\nback against the pressure can be galvanizing. Ten against two in a jury\nroom is a world of difference from eleven against one. One lone voice\ncrying out in the wilderness is a crank. Two voices joined together form\na nidus of resistance, offer the start of an oppositional social identity.\nIt certainly helps to know that you are not alone, that there are others\nwho are willing to resist, that there are those who have done so in the\npast. But often something still holds us back. Eichmann’s seeming\nnormalcy supplied us, thanks to Hannah Arendt, with the notion of the\nbanality of evil. Zimbardo, in his recent writing, emphasizes the\n“banality of heroism.” As discussed in various chapters, people who\nheroically refuse to look the other way, who do the right thing even when\nit carries the ultimate cost—tend to be surprisingly normal. The stars\ndidn’t align at their births; doves of peace did not envelop them where\nhaving marked status differences among individuals and\nhierarchies that emerge from those differences. Like\nmany of these other species, we’re fantastically attuned\nto status differences, are sufficiently fascinated by them\nthat we monitor status relations in individuals who are\nirrelevant to us, and can perceive status differences in a\nblink of an eye. And we find it deeply unsettling, with\nthe amygdala leading front and center, when status\nrelations are ambiguous and shifting.\nAs in so many other species, our brains, particularly the\nneocortex and most particularly the frontal cortex, have\ncoevolved with the social complexity of status\ndifferences. It takes a lot of brainpower to make sense of\nthe subtleties of dominance relations. This is no surprise,\ngiven that “knowing your place” can be so contextual.\nNavigating status differences is most challenging when\nit comes to attaining and maintaining high rank; this\nrequires cognitive mastery of Theory of Mind and\nperspective taking; of manipulation, intimidation, and\ndeceit; and of impulse control and emotion regulation.\nAs with so many other primates, the biographies of our\nmost hierarchically successful members are built around\nwhat provocations are ignored during occasions where\nthe frontal cortex kept a level head.\nOur bodies and brains, like those of other social species,\nbear the imprint of social status, and having the “wrong”\nrank can be corrosively pathogenic. Moreover, the\nphysiology is not so much about rank per se as about its\nsocial meaning in your species and particular group, the\nadept at overvaluing those in which we excel, and\nmaintain internal standards that can trump objective\nrank in their impact.\nHumans committed themselves to a unique trajectory\nwhen we invented socioeconomic status. In terms of its\ncaustic, scarring impact on minds and bodies, nothing in\nthe history of animals being crappy to one another about\nstatus differences comes within light-years of our\ninvention of poverty.\nWe’re really out there as a species in that sometimes our\nhigh-status individuals don’t merely plunder and instead\nactually lead, actually attempt to facilitate the common\ngood. We’ve even developed bottom-up mechanisms for\ncollectively choosing such leaders on occasion. A\nmagnificent achievement. Which we then soil by having\nour choosing of leaders be shaped by implicit, automatic\nfactors more suitable to five-year-olds deciding who\nshould captain their boat on a voyage with the\nTeletubbies to Candyland.\nStripped to their idealistic core, our political differences\nconcern differing visions of how best to bring about the\ncommon good. We tend to come as internally consistent\npackages of political stances ranging from the small and\nlocal to the mammoth and global. And with remarkable\nregularity our stances reflect our implicit, affective\nmakeup, with cognition playing post-hoc catch up. If\nyou really want to understand someone’s politics,\nunderstand their cognitive load, how prone they are to\nsnap judgments, their approaches to reappraisal and\nresolving cognitive dissonance. Even more important,\nunderstand how they feel about novelty, ambiguity,\nempathy, hygiene, disease and dis-ease, and whether\nthings used to be better and the future is a scary place.\nLike so many other animals, we have an often-frantic\namygdalae spasm with anxiety, our memories are\nrevised, and our sensory-processing regions are even\npressured to experience what is not true. All to fit in.\nFinally, the pull of conformity and obedience can lead us\nto some of our darkest, most appalling places, and far\nmore of us can be led there than we’d like to think. But\ndespite that, even the worst of barrels doesn’t turn all\napples bad, and “Resistance” and “Heroism” are often\nmore accessible and less rarefied and capitalized than\nassumed. We’re rarely alone in thinking this is wrong,"

    "content": "Morality and Doing the\nRight Thing, Once You’ve\nFigured Out What That Is\nhe two previous chapters examined the thoroughly unique\ncontexts for some human behaviors that are on a continuum with\nbehaviors in other species. Like some other species, we make automatic\nUs/Them dichotomies and favor the former—though only humans\nrationalize that tendency with ideology. Like many other species, we are\nimplicitly hierarchical—though only humans view the gap between\nhaves and have-nots as a divine plan.\nThis chapter considers another domain rife with human uniqueness,\nnamely morality. For us, morality is not only belief in norms of\nappropriate behavior but also the belief that they should be shared and\ntransmitted culturally.\nWork in the field is dominated by a familiar sort of question. When\nwe make a decision regarding morality, is it mostly the outcome of moral\nreasoning or of moral intuition? Do we mostly think or feel our way to\ndeciding what is right?\nThis raises a related question. Is human morality as new as the\ncultural institutions we’ve hatched in recent millennia, or are its\nrudiments a far older primate legacy?\nThis raises more questions. What’s more impressive, consistencies\nand universalities of human moral behavior or variability and its\ncorrelation with cultural and ecological factors?\n478\nwhen on reasoning? And when we resist temptation, is it mostly an act of\nwill or of grace?\nPeople have confronted these issues since students attended intro\nphilosophy in togas. Naturally, these questions are informed by science.\n\nMORAL DECISION MAKING\nne single fact perfectly demonstrates moral decision making being\nbased on cognition and reasoning. Have you ever picked up a law\ntextbook? They’re humongous.\nEvery society has rules about moral and ethical behavior that are\nreasoned and call upon logical operations. Applying the rules requires\nreconstructing scenarios, understanding proximal and distal causes of\nevents, and assessing magnitudes and probabilities of consequences of\nactions. Assessing individual behavior requires perspective taking,\nTheory of Mind, and distinguishing between outcome and intent.\nMoreover, in many cultures rule implementation is typically entrusted to\npeople (e.g., lawyers, clergy) who have undergone long training.\nHarking back to chapter 7, the primacy of reasoning in moral\ndecision making is anchored in child development. The Kohlbergian\nemergence of increasingly complex stages of moral development is built\non the Piagetian emergence of increasingly complex logical operations.\nThey are similar, neurobiologically. Logical and moral reasoning about\nthe correctness of an economic or ethical decision, respectively, both\nactivate the (cognitive) dlPFC. People with obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder get mired in both everyday decision making and moral decision\nmaking, and their dlPFCs go wild with activity for both.1\nSimilarly, there’s activation of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ)\nduring Theory of Mind tasks, whether they are perceptual (e.g.,\nvisualizing a complex scene from another viewer’s perspective), amoral\n(e.g., keeping straight who’s in love with whom in A Midsummer Night’s\nDream), or moral/social (e.g., inferring the ethical motivation behind a\nperson’s act). Moreover, the more the TPJ activation, the more people\ntake intent into account when making moral judgments, particularly\nwhen there was intent to harm but no actual harm done. Most important,\nasymmetries.3 For example, doing harm is worse than allowing it—for\nequivalent outcomes we typically judge commission more harshly than\nomission and must activate the dlPFC more to judge them as equal. This\nmakes sense—when we do one thing, there are innumerable other things\nwe didn’t do; no wonder the former is psychologically weightier. As\nanother cognitive skew, as discussed in chapter 10, we’re better at\ndetecting violations of social contracts that have malevolent rather than\nbenevolent consequences (e.g., giving less versus more than promised).\nWe also search harder for causality (and come up with more false\nattributions) for malevolent than for benevolent events.\nThis was shown in one study. First scenario: A worker proposes a\nplan to the boss, saying, “If we do this, there’ll be big profits, and we’ll\nharm the environment in the process.” The boss answers: “I don’t care\nabout the environment. Just do it.” Second scenario: Same setup, but this\ntime there’ll be big profits and benefits to the environment. Boss: “I\ndon’t care about the environment. Just do it.” In the first scenario 85\npercent of subjects stated that the boss harmed the environment in order\nto increase profits; however, in the second scenario only 23 percent said\nthat the boss helped the environment in order to increase profits.4\n—\nOkay, we’re not perfect reasoning machines. But that’s our goal, and\nnumerous moral philosophers emphasize the preeminence of reasoning,\nwhere emotion and intuition, if they happen to show up, just soil the\ncarpet. Such philosophers range from Kant, with his search for a\nmathematics of morality, to Princeton philosopher Peter Singer, who\nkvetches that if things like sex and bodily functions are pertinent to\nINTUITIONISM\nxcept there’s a problem with this conclusion—people often haven’t\na clue why they’ve made some judgment, yet they fervently believe\nit’s correct.\nThis is straight out of chapter 11’s rapid implicit assessments of Us\nversus Them and our post-hoc rational justifications for visceral\nprejudice. Scientists studying moral philosophy increasingly emphasize\nmoral decision making as implicit, intuitive, and anchored in emotion.\nThe king of this “social intuitionist” school is Jonathan Haidt, whom\nwe’ve encountered previously.6 Haidt views moral decisions as primarily\nbased on intuition and believes reasoning is what we then use to\nconvince everyone, including ourselves, that we’re making sense. In an\napt phrase of Haidt’s, “moral thinking is for social doing,” and sociality\nalways has an emotional component.\nThe evidence for the social intuitionist school is plentiful:\nWhen contemplating moral decisions, we don’t just activate the\neggheady dlPFC.7 There’s also activation of the usual emotional\ncast—amygdala, vmPFC and the related orbitofrontal cortex,\ninsular cortex, anterior cingulate. Different types of moral\ntransgressions preferentially activate different subsets of these\nregions. For example, moral quandaries eliciting pity\npreferentially activate the insula; those eliciting indignation\nactivate the orbitofrontal cortex. Quandaries generating intense\nconflict preferentially activate the anterior cingulate. Finally, for\nacts assessed as equally morally wrong, those involving\nnonsexual transgression (e.g., stealing from a sibling) activate\nthe amygdala, whereas those involving sexual transgressions\n(e.g., sex with a sibling) also activate the insula.*\nadjudicate in contemplative silence. The waters roil below.\nThe pattern of activation in these regions predicts moral\ndecisions better than does the dlPFC’s profile. And this matches\nbehavior—people punish to the extent that they feel angered by\nsomeone acting unethically.8\nPeople tend toward instantaneous moral reactions; moreover,\nwhen subjects shift from judging nonmoral elements of acts to\nmoral ones, they make assessments faster, the antithesis of moral\ndecision making being about grinding cognition. Most strikingly,\nwhen facing a moral quandary, activation in the amygdala,\nvmPFC, and insula typically precedes dlPFC activation.9\nDamage to these intuitionist brain regions makes moral\njudgments more pragmatic, even coldhearted. Recall from\nchapter 10 how people with damage to the (emotional) vmPFC\nreadily advocate sacrificing one relative to save five strangers,\nsomething control subjects never do.\nMost telling is when we have strong moral opinions but can’t tell\nwhy, something Haidt calls “moral dumbfounding”—followed\nby clunky post-hoc rationalizing.10 Moreover, such moral\ndecisions can differ markedly in different affective or visceral\ncircumstances, generating very different rationalizations. Recall\nfrom the last chapter how people become more conservative in\ntheir social judgments when they’re smelling a foul odor or\nsitting at a dirty desk. And then there’s that doozy of a finding—\nknowing a judge’s opinions about Plato, Nietzsche, Rawls, and\nany other philosopher whose name I just looked up gives you\nless predictive power about her judicial decisions than knowing\nif she’s hungry.\n483\ncapacities for moral reasoning.\n\nuch as infants demonstrate the rudiments of hierarchical and\nUs/Them thinking, they possess building blocks of moral\nreasoning as well. For starters, infants have the bias concerning\ncommission versus omission. In one clever study, six-month-olds\nwatched a scene containing two of the same objects, one blue and one\nred; repeatedly, the scene would show a person picking the blue object.\nThen, one time, the red one is picked. The kid becomes interested, looks\nmore, breathes faster, showing that this seems discrepant. Now, the scene\nshows two of the same objects, one blue, one a different color. In each\nrepetition of the scene, a person picks the one that is not blue (its color\nchanges with each repetition). Suddenly, the blue one is picked. The kid\nisn’t particularly interested. “He always picks the blue one” is easier to\ncomprehend than “He never picks the blue one.” Commission is\nweightier.11\nInfants and toddlers also have hints of a sense of justice, as shown by\nKiley Hamlin of the University of British Columbia, and Paul Bloom and\nKaren Wynn of Yale. Six- to twelve-month-olds watch a circle moving\nup a hill. A nice triangle helps to push it. A mean square blocks it.\nAfterward the infants can reach for a triangle or a square. They choose\nthe triangle.* Do infants prefer nice beings, or shun mean ones? Both.\nNice triangles were preferred over neutral shapes, which were preferred\nover mean squares.\nSuch infants advocate punishing bad acts. A kid watches puppets,\none good, one bad (sharing versus not). The child is then presented with\nthe puppets, each sitting on a pile of sweets. Who should lose a sweet?\nThe bad puppet. Who should gain one? The good puppet.\nRemarkably, toddlers even assess secondary punishment. The good\nand bad puppets then interact with two additional puppets, who can be\nnice or bad. And whom did kids prefer of those second-layer puppets?\nThose who were nice to nice puppets and those who punished mean\nones.\npalm up, a capuchin begging gesture. If the monkey puts the pebble in\nher hand, there’s a food reward. In other words, the animals learned how\nto buy food.\nNow there are two capuchins, side by side. Each gets a pebble. Each\ngives it to the human. Each gets a grape, very rewarding.\nNow change things. Both monkeys pay their pebble. Monkey 1 gets a\ngrape. But monkey 2 gets some cucumber, which blows compared with\ngrapes—capuchins prefer grapes to cucumber 90 percent of the time.\nMonkey 2 was shortchanged.\nAnd monkey 2 would then typically fling the cucumber at the human\nor bash around in frustration. Most consistently, they wouldn’t give the\npebble the next time. As the Nature paper was entitled, “Monkeys reject\nunequal pay.”\nThis response has since been demonstrated in various macaque\nmonkey species, crows, ravens, and dogs (where the dog’s “work” would\nbe shaking her paw).*13\nSubsequent work by Brosnan, de Waal, and others fleshed out this\nphenomenon further:14\nOne criticism of the original study was that maybe\ncapuchins refused to work for cucumbers because\ngrapes were visible, regardless of whether the other guy\nwas getting paid in grapes. But no—the phenomenon\nrequired unfair payment.\nBoth animals are getting grapes, then one gets switched\nto cucumber. What’s key—that the other guy is still\ngetting grapes, or that I no longer am? The former—if\ndoing the study with a single monkey, switching from\ngrapes to cucumbers would not evoke refusal. Nor\nwould it if both monkeys got cucumbers.\nAcross the various species, males were more likely than\nfemales to reject “lower pay”; dominant animals were\nmore likely than subordinates to reject.\nFinally, rejection of unfair pay isn’t seen in species that\nare solitary (e.g., orangutans) or have minimal social\ncooperation (e.g., owl monkeys).\nOkay, very impressive—other social species show hints of a sense of\njustice, reacting negatively to unequal reward. But this is worlds away\nfrom juries awarding money to plaintiffs harmed by employers. Instead\nit’s self-interest—“This isn’t fair; I’m getting screwed.”\nHow about evidence of a sense of fairness in the treatment of another\nindividual? Two studies have examined this in a chimp version of the\nUltimatum Game. Recall the human version—in repeated rounds, player\n1 in a pair decides how money is divided between the two of them.\nPlayer 2 is powerless in the decision making but, if unhappy with the\nsplit, can refuse, and no one gets any money. In other words, player 2 can\nforgo immediate reward to punish selfish player 1. As we saw in chapter\n10, Player 2s tend to accept 60:40 splits.\nIn the chimp version, chimp 1, the proposer, has two tokens. One\nindicates that each chimp gets two grapes. The other indicates that the\nproposer gets three grapes, the partner only one. The proposer chooses a\ntoken and passes it to chimp 2, who then decides whether to pass the\ntoken to the human grape dispenser. In other words, if chimp 2 thinks\nchimp 1 is being unfair, no one gets grapes.\nIn one such study, Michael Tomasello (a frequent critic of de Waal—\nstay tuned) at the Max Planck Institutes in Germany, found no evidence\nof chimp fairness—the proposer always chose, and the partner always\naccepted unfair splits.15 De Waal and Brosnan did the study in more\nethologically valid conditions and reported something different: proposer\nchimps tended toward equitable splits, but if they could give the token\ndirectly to the human (robbing chimp 2 of veto power), they’d favor\nunfair splits. So chimps will opt for fairer splits—but only when there is\na downside to being unfair.\nSometimes other primates are fair when it’s at no cost to themselves.\nBack to capuchin monkeys. Monkey 1 chooses whether both he and the\nother guy get marshmallows or it’s a marshmallow for him and yucky\nstudies have failed to find other-regarding preference in chimps).16\nReally interesting evidence for a nonhuman sense of justice comes in\na small side study in a Brosnan/de Waal paper. Back to the two monkeys\ngetting cucumbers for work. Suddenly one guy gets shifted to grapes. As\nwe saw, the one still getting the cucumber refuses to work. Fascinatingly,\nthe grape mogul often refuses as well.\nWhat is this? Solidarity? “I’m no strike-breaking scab”? Self-interest,\nbut with an atypically long view about the possible consequences of the\ncucumber victim’s resentment? Scratch an altruistic capuchin and a\nhypocritical one bleeds? In other words, all the questions raised by\nhuman altruism.\nGiven the relatively limited reasoning capacities of monkeys, these\nfindings support the importance of social intuitionism. De Waal\nperceives even deeper implications—the roots of human morality are\nolder than our cultural institutions, than our laws and sermons. Rather\nany moral philosophers believe not only that moral judgment is\nbuilt on reasoning but also that it should be. This is obvious to\nfans of Mr. Spock, since the emotional component of moral intuitionism\njust introduces sentimentality, self-interest, and parochial biases. But one\nremarkable finding counters this.\nRelatives are special. Chapter 10 attests to that. Any social organism\nwould tell you so. Joseph Stalin thought so concerning Pavlik Morozov\nratting out his father. As do most American courts, where there is either\nde facto or de jure resistance to making someone testify against their\nown parent or child. Relatives are special. But not to people lacking\nsocial intuitionism. As noted, people with vmPFC damage make\nextraordinarily practical, unemotional moral decisions. And in the\nprocess they do something that everyone, from clonal yeast to Uncle Joe\nto the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence considers morally suspect: they\nadvocate harming kin as readily as strangers in an “Is it okay to sacrifice\none person to save five?” scenario.18\nEmotion and social intuition are not some primordial ooze that gums\no social intuitions can have large, useful roles in moral decision\nmaking. Should we now debate whether reasoning or intuition is\nmore important? This is silly, not least of all because there is\nconsiderable overlap between the two. Consider, for example, protesters\nshutting down a capital to highlight income inequity. This could be\nframed as the Kohlbergian reasoning of people in a postconventional\nstage. But it could also be framed à la Haidt in a social intuitionist way—\nthese are people who resonate more with moral intuitions about fairness\nthan with respect for authority.\nMore interesting than squabbling about the relative importance of\nreasoning and intuition are two related questions: What circumstances\nbias toward emphasizing one over the other? Can the differing emphases\nproduce different decisions?\nAs we’ve seen, then–graduate student Josh Greene and colleagues\nhelped jump-start “neuroethics” by exploring these questions using the\nposter child of “Do the ends justify the means?” philosophizing, namely\nthe runaway trolley problem. A trolley’s brake has failed, and it is\nhurtling down the tracks and will hit and kill five people. Is it okay to do\nsomething that saves the five but kills someone else in the process?\nPeople have pondered this since Aristotle took his first trolley ride;*\nGreene et al. added neuroscience. Subjects were neuroimaged while\npondering trolley ethics. Crucially, they considered two scenarios.\nScenario 1: Here comes the trolley; five people are goners. Would you\npull a lever that diverts the trolley onto a different track, where it will hit\nand kill someone (the original scenario)? Scenario 2: Same circumstance.\nWould you push the person onto the tracks to stop the trolley?19\nBy now I bet readers can predict which brain region(s) activates in\neach circumstance. Contemplate pulling the lever, and dlPFC activity\npredominates, the detached, cerebral profile of moral reasoning.\nContemplate consigning the person to death by pushing them, and it’s\nvmPFC (and amygdala), the visceral profile of moral intuition.\nactivation, the more likely they are to refuse.* This is hugely important\n—a relatively minor variable determines whether people emphasize\nmoral reasoning or intuition, and they engage different brain circuits in\nthe process, producing radically different decisions. Greene has explored\nthis further.\nAre people resistant to the utilitarian trade-off of killing one to save\nfive in the pushing scenario because of the visceral reality of actually\ntouching the person whom they have consigned to death? Greene’s work\nsuggests not—if instead of pushing with your hands, you push with a\npole, people are still resistant. There’s something about the personal\nforce involved that fuels the resistance.\nAre people willing in the lever scenario because the victim is at a\ndistance, rather than right in front of them? Probably not—people are\njust as willing if the lever is right next to the person who will die.\nGreene suggests that intuitions about intentionality are key. In the\nlever scenario, the five people are saved because the trolley has been\ndiverted to another track; the killing of the individual is a side effect and\nthe five would still have been saved if that person hadn’t been standing\non the tracks. In contrast, in the pushing scenario the five are saved\nbecause the person is killed, and the intentionality feels intuitively\nwrong. As evidence, Greene would give subjects another scenario: Here\ncomes the trolley, and you are rushing to throw a switch that will halt it.\nIs it okay to do this if you know that in the process of lunging for the\nswitch, you must push a person out of the way, who falls to the ground\nand dies? About 80 percent of people say yes. Same pushing the person,\nsame proximity, but done unintentionally, as a side effect. The person\nwasn’t killed as a means to save the five. Which seems much more okay.\nNow a complication. In the “loop” scenario, you pull a lever that\ndiverts the trolley to another track. But—oh no!—it’s just a loop; it\nmerges back on to the original track. The trolley will still kill the five\npeople—except that there’s a person on the side loop who will be killed,\nstopping the trolley. This is as intentional a scenario as is pushing with\nyour hands—diverting to another track isn’t enough; the person has to be\nintentionally as a means to save five feels intuitively wrong, but the\nintuition is strongest when the killing would occur right here, right now;\ndoing it in more complicated sequences of intentionality doesn’t feel as\nbad. This is not because of a cognitive limit—it’s not that subjects don’t\nrealize the necessity of killing the person in the loop scenario. It just\ndoesn’t feel the same. In other words, intuitions discount heavily over\nspace and time. Exactly the myopia about cause and effect you’d expect\nfrom a brain system that operates rapidly and automatically. This is the\nsame sort of myopia that makes sins of commission feel worse than those\nof omission.\nThus these studies suggest that when a sacrifice of one requires\nactive, intentional, and local actions, more intuitive brain circuitry is\nengaged, and ends don’t justify means. And in circumstances where\neither the harm is unintentional or the intentionality plays out at a\npsychological distance, different neural circuitry predominates,\nproducing an opposite conclusion about the morality of ends and means.\nThese trolleyology studies raise a larger point, which is that moral\ndecision making can be wildly context dependent.20 Often the key thing\nthat a change in context does is alter the locality of one’s intuitionist\nmorals, as summarized by Dan Ariely of Duke University in his\nwonderful book Predictably Irrational. Leave money around a common\nwork area and no one takes it; it’s not okay to steal money. Leave some\ncans of Coke and they’re all taken; the one-step distance from the money\ninvolved blunts the intuitions about the wrongness of stealing, making it\neasier to start rationalizing (e.g., someone must have left them out for the\ntaking).\nThe effects of proximity on moral intuitionism are shown in a\nthought experiment by Peter Singer.21 You’re walking by a river in your\nhometown. You see that a child has fallen in. Most people feel morally\nobliged to jump in and save the child, even if the water destroys their\n$500 suit. Alternatively, a friend in Somalia calls and tells you about a\npoor child there who will die without $500 worth of medical care. Can\nyou send money? Typically not. The locality and moral discounting over\ndistance is obvious—the child in danger in your hometown is far more of\nbeing right there, in the flesh, in front of our eyes is a strong implicit\nprime that they are an Us.\nMoral context dependency can also revolve around language, as\nnoted in chapter 3.22 Recall, for example, people using different rules\nabout the morality of cooperation if you call the same economic game\nthe “Wall Street game” or the “community game.” Framing an\nexperimental drug as having a “5 percent mortality rate” versus a “95\npercent survival rate” produces different decisions about the ethics of\nusing it.\nFraming also taps into the themes of people having multiple\nidentities, belonging to multiple Us groups and hierarchies. This was\nshown in a hugely interesting 2014 Nature paper by Alain Cohn and\ncolleagues at the University of Zurich.23 Subjects, who worked for an\n(unnamed) international bank, played a coin-toss game with financial\nrewards for guessing outcomes correctly. Crucially, the game’s design\nmade it possible for subjects to cheat at various points (and for the\ninvestigators to detect the cheating).\nIn one version subjects first completed a questionnaire filled with\nmundane questions about their everyday lives (e.g., “How many hours of\ntelevision do you watch each week?”). This produced a low, baseline\nlevel of cheating.\nThen, in the experimental version, the questionnaire was about their\nbank job. Questions like these primed the subjects to implicitly think\nmore about banking (e.g., they became more likely in a word task to\ncomplete “__oker” with “broker” than with “smoker”).\nSo subjects were thinking about their banking identity. And when\nthey did, rates of cheating rose 20 percent. Priming people in other\nprofessions (e.g., manufacturing) to think about their jobs, or about the\nbanking world, didn’t increase cheating. These bankers carried in their\nheads two different sets of ethical rules concerning cheating (banking\nand nonbanking), and unconscious cuing brought one or the other to the\nbelieves it is okay to steal, kill, rape, and plunder. But far more of\nhumanity’s worst behaviors are due to a different kind of person, namely\nmost of the rest of us, who will say that of course it is wrong to do X . . .\nbut here is why these special circumstances make me an exception right\nnow.\nWe use different brain circuits when contemplating our own moral\nfailings (heavy activation of the vmPFC) versus those of others (more of\nthe insula and dlPFC).24 And we consistently make different judgments,\nbeing more likely to exempt ourselves than others from moral\ncondemnation. Why? Part of it is simply self-serving; sometimes a\nhypocrite bleeds because you’ve scratched a hypocrite. The difference\nmay also reflect different emotions being involved when we analyze our\nown actions versus those of others. Considering the moral failings of the\nlatter may evoke anger and indignation, while their moral triumphs\nprompt emulation and inspiration. In contrast, considering our own\nmoral failings calls forth shame and guilt, while our triumphs elicit pride.\nThe affective aspects of going easy on ourselves are shown when\nstress makes us more this way.25 When experimentally stressed, subjects\nmake more egoistic, rationalizing judgments regarding emotional moral\ndilemmas and are less likely to make utilitarian judgments—but only\nwhen the latter involve a personal moral issue. Moreover, the bigger the\nglucocorticoid response to the stressor, the more this is the case.\nGoing easy on ourselves also reflects a key cognitive fact: we judge\nourselves by our internal motives and everyone else by their external\nactions.26 And thus, in considering our own misdeeds, we have more\naccess to mitigating, situational information. This is straight out of\nUs/Them—when Thems do something wrong, it’s because they’re\nsimply rotten; when Us-es do it, it’s because of an extenuating\ncircumstance, and “Me” is the most focal Us there is, coming with the\nmost insight into internal state. Thus, on this cognitive level there is no\ninconsistency or hypocrisy, and we might readily perceive a wrong to be\nmitigated by internal motives in the case of anyone’s misdeeds. It’s just\neasier to know those motives when we are the perpetrator.\nThe adverse consequences of this are wide and deep. Moreover, the\nCultural Context\nSo people make different moral judgments about the same\ncircumstance depending on whether it’s about them or someone else,\nwhich of their identities has been primed, the language used, how many\nsteps the intentionality is removed, and even the levels of their stress\nhormones, the fullness of their stomach, or the smelliness of their\nenvironment. After chapter 9 it is no surprise that moral decision making\ncan also vary dramatically by culture. One culture’s sacred cow is\nanother’s meal, and the discrepancy can be agonizing.\nWhen thinking about cross-cultural differences in morality, key\nissues are what universals of moral judgment exist and whether the\nuniversals or the differences are more interesting and important.\nChapter 9 noted some moral stances that are virtually universal,\nwhether de facto or de jure. These include condemnation of at least some\nforms of murder and of theft. Oh, and of some form of sexual practice.\nMore broadly, there is the near universal of the Golden Rule (with\ncultures differing as to whether it is framed as “Do only things you’d\nwant done to you” or “Don’t do things you wouldn’t want done to you”).\nAmid the power of its simplicity, the Golden Rule does not incorporate\npeople differing as to what they would/wouldn’t want done to them; we\nhave entered complicated terrain when we can make sense of an\ninterchange where a masochist says, “Beat me,” and the sadist\nsadistically answers, “No.”\nThis criticism is overcome with the use of a more generalized,\ncommon currency of reciprocity, where we are enjoined to give concern\nand legitimacy to the needs and desires of people in circumstances where\nwe would want the same done for us.\nCross-cultural universals of morality arise from shared categories of\nrules of moral behavior. The anthropologist Richard Shweder has\nproposed that all cultures recognize rules of morality pertinent to\nautonomy, community, and divinity. As we saw in the last chapter,\nJonathan Haidt breaks this continuum into his foundations of morality\nShweder’s realm of divinity).*27\nThe existence of universals of morality raises the issue of whether\nthat means that they should trump more local, provincial moral rules.\nBetween the moral absolutists on one side and the relativists on the other,\npeople like the historian of science Michael Shermer argue reasonably\nfor provisional morality—if a moral stance is widespread across cultures,\nstart off by giving the benefit of the doubt to its importance, but watch\nyour wallet.28\nIt’s certainly interesting that, for example, all cultures designate\ncertain things as sacred; but it is far more so to look at the variability in\nwhat is considered sacred, how worked up people get when such sanctity\nis violated,* and what is done to keep such violations from reoccurring.\nI’ll touch on this huge topic with three subjects—cross-cultural\ndifferences concerning the morality of cooperation and competition,\naffronts to honor, and the reliance on shame versus guilt.\nCOOPERATION AND COMPETITION\nSome of the most dramatic cross-cultural variability in moral\njudgment concerns cooperation and competition. This was shown to an\nextraordinary extent in a 2008 Science paper by a team of British and\nSwiss economists.\nSubjects played a “public good” economic game where players begin\nwith a certain number of tokens and then decide, in each of a series of\nrounds, how many to contribute to a shared pool; the pool is then\nmultiplied and shared evenly among all the players. The alternative to\ncontributing is for subjects to keep the tokens for themselves. Thus, the\nworst payoff for an individual player would be if they contributed all\ntheir tokens to the pool, while no other player contributed any; the best\nwould be if the individual contributed no tokens and everyone else\ncontributed everything. As a feature of the design, subjects could “pay”\nto punish other players for the size of their contribution. Subjects were\nfrom around the world.\nFirst finding: Across all cultures, people were more prosocial than\nsheer economic rationality would predict. If everyone played in the most\nWhere the startling difference came was with a behavior that I’d\nnever even seen before in the behavioral economics literature, something\ncalled “antisocial punishment.” Free-riding punishment is when you\npunish another player for contributing less than you (i.e., being selfish).\nAntisocial punishment is when you punish another player for\ncontributing more than you (i.e., being generous).\nWhat is that about? Interpretation: This hostility toward someone\nbeing overly generous is because they’re going to up the ante, and soon\neveryone (i.e., me) will be expected to be generous. Kill ’em, spoiling\nthings for everyone. It’s a phenomenon where you punish someone for\nbeing nice, because what if that sort of crazy deviance becomes the norm\nand you feel pressure to be nice back?\nAt one extreme were subjects from countries (the United States and\nAustralia) where this weird antisocial punishment was nearly\nnonexistent. And at the mind-boggling other extreme were subjects from\nOman and Greece, who were willing to spend more to punish generosity\nthan to punish selfishness. And this was not a comparison of, say,\ntheologians in Boston with Omani pirates. Subjects were all urban\nuniversity students.\nSo what’s different among these cities? The authors found a key\ncorrelation—the lower the social capital in a country, the higher the rates\nof antisocial punishment. In other words, when do people’s moral\nsystems include the idea that being generous deserves punishment?\nWhen they live in a society where people don’t trust one another and feel\nas if they have no efficacy.\nFascinating work has also been done specifically on people in non-\nWestern cultures, as reported in a pair of studies by Joseph Henrich, of\nthe University of British Columbia, and colleagues.29 Subjects were in\nthe thousands and came from twenty-five different “small-scale” cultures\nfrom around the world—they were nomadic pastoralists, hunter-\ngatherers, sedentary forager/horticulturalists, and subsistence\nfarmers/wage earners. There were two control groups, namely urbanites\nfrom Missouri and Accra, Ghana. As a particularly thorough feature of\nthe study, subjects played three economic games: (a) The Dictator Game,\npunishment). (c) A third-party punishment scenario, where you can pay\nto punish someone treating a third party unfairly (i.e., altruistic\npunishment).\nB. Herrmann et al., “Antisocial Punishment Across Societies,” Sci 319 (2008):\n1362.\nVisit bit.ly/2neVZaA for a larger version of this graph.\nThe authors identified three fascinating variables that predicted\npatterns of play:\nMarket integration: How much do people in a culture interact\neconomically, with trade items? The authors operationalized this as the\npredicted people making fairer offers in all three games and being\nwilling to pay for both self-interested second-party and altruistic third-\nparty punishment of creeps. For example, the Hadza, at one extreme,\nkept an average of 73 percent of the spoils for themselves in the Dictator\nGame, while the sedentary fishing Sanquianga of Colombia, along with\npeople in the United States and Accra, approached dictating a 50:50\nsplit. Market integration predicts more willingness to punish selfishness\nand, no surprise, less selfishness.\nCommunity size: The bigger the community, the more the incidence of\nsecond- and third-party punishment of cheapskates. Hadza, for example,\nin their tiny bands of fifty or fewer, would pretty much accept any offer\nabove zero in the Ultimatum Game—there was no punishment. At the\nother extreme, in communities of five thousand or more (sedentary\nagriculturalists and aquaculturalists, plus the Ghanaian and American\nurbanites), offers that weren’t in the ballpark of 50:50 were typically\nrejected and/or punished.\nReligion: What percentage of the population belonged to a worldwide\nreligion (i.e., Christianity or Islam)? This ranged from none of the Hadza\nto 60 to 100 percent for all the other groups. The greater the incidence of\nbelonging to a Western religion, the more third-party punishment (i.e.,\nwillingness to pay to punish person A for being unfair to person B).\nWhat to make of these findings?\nFirst the religion angle. This was a finding not about religiosity\ngenerally but about religiosity within a worldwide religion, and not about\ngenerosity or fairness but about altruistic third-party punishment. What is\nit about worldwide religions? As we saw in chapter 9, it is only when\ngroups get large enough that people regularly interact with strangers that\ncultures invent moralizing gods. These are not gods who sit around the\nbanquet table laughing with detachment at the foibles of humans down\nbelow, or gods who punish humans for lousy sacrificial offerings. These\nare gods who punish humans for being rotten to other humans—in other\nwords, the large religions invent gods who do third-party punishment.\nNo wonder this predicts these religions’ adherents being third-party\npunishers themselves.\nauthors thoughtfully did.\nThe authors ask where the uniquely extreme sense of fairness comes\nfrom in humans, particularly in the context of large-scale societies with\nstrangers frequently interacting. And they offer two traditional types of\nexplanations that are closely related to our dichotomies of intuition\nversus reasoning and animal roots versus cultural inventions:\nOur moral anchoring in fairness in large-scale societies\nis a residue and extension of our hunter-gatherer and\nnonhuman primate past. This was life in small bands,\nwhere fairness was mostly driven by kin selection and\neasy scenarios of reciprocal altruism. As our community\nsize has expanded and we now mostly have one-shot\ninteractions with unrelated strangers, our prosociality\njust represents an expansion of our small-band mind-set,\nas we use various green-beard marker shibboleths as\nproxies for relatedness. I’d gladly lay down my life for\ntwo brothers, eight cousins, or a guy who is a fellow\nPackers fan.\nThe moral underpinnings of a sense of fairness lie in\ncultural institutions and mind-sets that we invented as\nour groups became larger and more sophisticated (as\nreflected in the emergence of markets, cash economies,\nand the like).\nThis many pages in, it’s obvious that I think the former scenario is\npretty powerful—look, we see the roots of a sense of fairness and justice\nin the egalitarian nature of nomadic hunter-gatherers, in other primates,\nin infants, in the preeminent limbic rather than cortical involvement. But,\ninconveniently for that viewpoint, that’s totally counter to what emerges\nfrom these studies—across the twenty-five cultures it’s the hunter-\ngatherers, the ones most like our ancestors, living in the smallest groups,\nwith the highest degrees of relatedness and with the least reliance on\nI think an explanation is that these economic games tap into a very\nspecific and artificial type of prosociality. We tend to think of market\ninteractions as being the epitome of complexity—finding a literal\ncommon currency for the array of human needs and desires in the form\nof this abstraction called money. But at their core, market interactions\nrepresent an impoverishment of human reciprocity. In its natural form,\nhuman reciprocity is a triumph of comfortably and intuitively doing\nlong-term math with apples and oranges—this guy over here is a\nsuperstar hunter; that other guy isn’t in his league but has your back if\nthere’s a lion around; meanwhile, she’s amazing at finding the best\nmongongo nuts, that older woman knows all about medicinal herbs, and\nthat geeky guy remembers the best stories. We know where one another\nlive, the debit columns even out over time, and if someone is really\nabusing the system, we’ll get around to collectively dealing with them.\nIn contrast, at its core, a cash-economy market interaction strips it all\ndown to “I give you this now, so you give me that now”—myopic\npresent-tense interactions whose obligations of reciprocity must be\nbalanced immediately. People in small-scale societies are relatively new\nto functioning this way. It’s not the case that small-scale cultures that are\ngrowing big and market reliant are newly schooled in how to be fair.\nInstead they’re newly schooled in how to be fair in the artificial\ncircumstances modeled by something like the Ultimatum Game.\nHONOR AND REVENGE\nAnother realm of cross-cultural differences in moral systems\nconcerns what constitutes appropriate response to personal affronts. This\nharks back to chapter 9’s cultures of honor, from Maasai tribesmen to\ntraditional American Southerners. As we saw, such cultures have\nhistorical links to monotheism, warrior age groups, and pastoralism.\nTo recap, such cultures typically see an unanswered challenge to\nhonor as the start of a disastrous slippery slope, rooted in the intrinsic\nvulnerability of pastoralism—while no one can raid farmers and steal all\ntheir crops, someone can rustle a herd overnight—and if this sum’a bitch\ngets away with insulting my family, he’ll be coming for my cattle next.\nelevated murder rates in the American South are not due to urban\nviolence or things like robberies but are instead about affronts to honor\nbetween people who know each other. And it helps explain why\nSouthern prosecutors and juries are typically more forgiving of such\ncrimes of affronted honor. And it also helps explain the command\napparently given by many Southern matriarchs to their sons marching off\nto join the Confederate fight: come back a winner or come back in a\ncoffin. The shame of surrender is not an option.\nSHAMED COLLECTIVISTS AND GUILTY INDIVIDUALISTS\nWe return to our contrast between collectivist and individualistic\ncultures (in the studies, as a reminder, “collectivist” has mostly meant\nEast Asian societies, while “individualistic” equals Western Europeans\nand North Americans). Implicit in the very nature of the contrast are\nmarkedly different approaches to the morality of ends and means. By\ndefinition, collectivist cultures are more comfortable than individualistic\nones with people being used as a means to a utilitarian end. Moreover,\nmoral imperatives in collectivist cultures tend to be about social roles\nand duties to the group, whereas those in individualistic cultures are\ntypically about individual rights.\nCollectivist and individualistic cultures also differ in how moral\nbehavior is enforced. As first emphasized by the anthropologist Ruth\nBenedict in 1946, collectivist cultures enforce with shame, while\nindividualistic cultures use guilt. This is a doozy of a contrast, as\nexplored in two excellent books, Stanford psychiatrist Herant\nKatchadourian’s Guilt: The Bite of Conscience and NYU environmental\nscientist Jennifer Jacquet’s Is Shame Necessary?30\nIn the sense used by most in the field, including these authors, shame\nis external judgment by the group, while guilt is internal judgment of\nyourself. Shame requires an audience, is about honor. Guilt is for\ncultures that treasure privacy and is about conscience. Shame is a\nnegative assessment of the entire individual, guilt that of an act, making\nit possible to hate the sin but love the sinner. Effective shaming requires\na conformist, homogeneous population; effective guilt requires respect\nFrom the time that Benedict first articulated this contrast, there has\nbeen a self-congratulatory view in the West that shame is somehow more\nprimitive than guilt, as the West has left behind dunce caps, public\nflogging, and scarlet letters. Shame is the mob; guilt is internalizing\nrules, laws, edicts, decrees, and statutes. Yet, Jacquet convincingly\nargues for the continued usefulness of shaming in the West, calling for its\nrebirth in a postmodernist form. For her, shaming is particularly useful\nwhen the powerful show no evidence of feeling guilt and evade\npunishment. We have no shortage of examples of such evasion in the\nAmerican legal system, where one can benefit from the best defense that\nmoney or power can buy; shaming can often step into that vacuum.\nConsider a 1999 scandal at UCLA, when more than a dozen healthy,\nstrapping football players were discovered to have used connections,\nmade-up disabilities, and forged doctors’ signatures to get handicapped\nparking permits. Their privileged positions resulted in what was\ngenerally seen as slaps on the wrist by both the courts and UCLA.\nHowever, the element of shaming may well have made up for it—as they\nleft the courthouse in front of the press, they walked past a phalanx of\ndisabled, wheelchair-bound individuals jeering them.31\nAnthropologists, studying everyone from hunter-gatherers to\nurbanites, have found that about two thirds of everyday conversation is\ngossip, with the vast majority of it being negative. As has been said,\ngossip (with the goal of shaming) is a weapon of the weak against the\npowerful. It has always been fast and cheap and is infinitely more so now\nin the era of the Scarlet Internet.\nShaming is also effective when dealing with outrages by\ncorporations.32 Bizarrely, the American legal system considers a\ncorporation to be an individual in many ways, one that is psychopathic in\nthe sense of having no conscience and being solely interested in profits.\nThe people running a corporation are occasionally criminally responsible\nwhen the corporation has done something illegal; however, they are not\nwhen the corporation does something legal yet immoral—it is outside the\nrealm of guilt. Jacquet emphasizes the potential power of shaming\ncampaigns, such as those that forced Nike to change its policies about\n503\nAmid the potential good that can come from such shaming, Jacquet\nalso emphasizes the dangers of contemporary shaming, which is the\nsavagery with which people can be attacked online and the distance such\nvenom can travel—in a world where getting to anonymously hate the\nsinner seems more important than anything about the sin itself.\n\nFINDINGS OF THE SCIENCE OF\nMORALITY\now can the insights we already have in hand be used to foster the\nbest of our behaviors and lessen the worst?\nWhich Dead White Male Was Right?\nLet’s start with a question that has kept folks busy for millennia,\nnamely, what is the optimal moral philosophy?\nPeople pondering this question have grouped the different\napproaches into three broad categories. Say there’s money sitting there,\nand it’s not yours but no one is looking; why not grab it?\nVirtue ethics, with its emphasis on the actor, would answer: because\nyou are a better person than that, because you’ll have to live with\nyourself afterward, etc.\nDeontology, with its emphasis on the act: because it’s not okay to\nsteal.\nConsequentialism, with its emphasis on the outcome: what if\neveryone started acting that way, think about the impact on the person\nwhose money you’ve stolen, etc.\n—\nVirtue ethics has generally taken a backseat to the other two in recent\nyears, having acquired a quaint veneer of antiquarian fretting over how\nan improper act tarnishes one’s soul. As we’ll see, I think that virtue\nethics returns through the back door with considerable relevance.\nBy focusing on deontology versus consequentialism, we are back on\nthe familiar ground of whether ends justify means. For deontologists the\nanswer is “No, people can never be pawns.” For the consequentialist the\nwealth,* to strengthen the powers that be (state consequentialism). For\nmost, though, consequentialism is about classical utilitarianism—it is\nokay to use people as a means to the end of maximizing overall levels of\nhappiness.\nWhen deontologism and consequentialism contemplate trolleys, the\nformer is about moral intuitions rooted in the vmPFC, amygdala, and\ninsula, while the latter is the domain of the dlPFC and moral reasoning.\nWhy is it that our automatic, intuitive moral judgments tend to be\nnonutilitarian? Because, as Greene states in his book, “Our moral brains\nevolved to help us spread our genes, not to maximize our collective\nhappiness.”\nThe trolley studies show people’s moral heterogeneity. In them\napproximately 30 percent of subjects were consistently deontologists,\nunwilling to either pull a lever or push a person, even at the cost of those\nfive lives. Another 30 percent were always utilitarian, willing to pull or\npush. And for everyone else, moral philosophies were context dependent.\nThe fact that a plurality of people fall into this category prompts\nGreene’s “dual process” model, stating that we are usually a mixture of\nvaluing means and ends. What’s your moral philosophy? If harm to the\nperson who is the means is unintentional or if the intentionality is really\nconvoluted and indirect, I’m a utilitarian consequentialist, and if the\nintentionality is right in front of my nose, I’m a deontologist.\nThe different trolley scenarios reveal what circumstances push us\ntoward intuitive deontology, which toward utilitarian reasoning. Which\noutcome is better?\nFor the sort of person reading this book (i.e., who reads and thinks,\nthings to be justifiably self-congratulatory about), when considering this\nissue at a calm distance, utilitarianism seems like the place to start—\nmaximizing collective happiness. There is the emphasis on equity—not\nequal treatment but taking everyone’s well-being into equal\nconsideration. And there is the paramount emphasis on impartiality: if\nsomeone thinks the situation being proposed is morally equitable, they\nshould be willing to flip a coin to determine which role they play.\nUtilitarianism can be critiqued on practical grounds—it’s hard to find\nutilitarianism.\nExcept that there’s a problem—unless someone is missing their\nvmPFC, the appeal of utilitarianism inevitably comes to a screeching halt\nat some point. For most people it’s pushing the person in front of the\ntrolley. Or smothering a crying baby to save a group of people hiding\nfrom Nazis. Or killing a healthy person to harvest his organs and save\nfive lives. As Greene emphasizes, virtually everyone immediately grasps\nthe logic and appeal of utilitarianism yet eventually hits a point where it\nis clear that it’s not a good guide for everyday moral decision making.\nGreene and, independently, the neuroscientist John Allman of\nCaltech and historian of science James Woodward of the University of\nPittsburgh have explored the neurobiological underpinnings of a key\npoint—the utilitarianism being considered here is unidimensional and\nartificial; it hobbles the sophistication of both our moral intuitions and\nour moral reasoning. A pretty convincing case can be made for utilitarian\nconsequentialism. As long as you consider the immediate consequences.\nAnd the longer-term consequences. And the long-long-term\nconsequences. And then go and consider them all over again a few times.\nWhen people hit a wall with utilitarianism, it’s because what is on\npaper a palatable trade-off in the short run (“Intentionally kill one to save\nfive—that obviously increases collective happiness”) turns out not to be\nso in the long run. “Sure, that healthy person’s involuntary organ\ndonation just saved five lives, but who else is going to get dissected that\nway? What if they come for me? I kinda like my liver. What else might\nthey start doing?” Slippery slopes, desensitization, unintended\nconsequences, intended consequences. When shortsighted utilitarianism\n(what Woodward and Allman call “parametric” consequentialism) is\nreplaced with a longer-viewed version (what they call “strategic”\nconsequentialism and what Greene calls “pragmatic utilitarianism”), you\nget better outcomes.\nOur overview of moral intuition versus moral reasoning has\ngenerated a dichotomy, something akin to how guys can’t have lots of\nblood flow to their crotch and their brain at the same time; they have to\nchoose. Similarly, you have to choose whether your moral decision\nlike a good trade-off in the short run. But in the long run, if we do that\noften enough, doing Z is going to start to seem okay also, and I’d feel\nawful if Z were done to me, and there’s also a good chance that W would\nhappen, and that’s going to generate really bad feelings in people, which\nwill result in . . .” And the “feel” part of that process is not the way Mr.\nSpock would do it, logically and dispassionately remembering that those\nhumans are irrational, flighty creatures and incorporating that into his\nrational thinking about them. Instead, this is feeling what the feelings\nwould feel like. This is straight out of chapter 2’s overview of Damasio’s\nsomatic marker hypothesis: when we are making decisions, we are\nrunning not only thought experiments but somatic feeling experiments as\nwell—how is it going to feel if this happens?—and this combination is\nthe goal in moral decision making.\nThus, “No way I’d push someone onto the trolley tracks; it’s just\nwrong” is about the amygdala, insula, and vmPFC. “Sacrifice one life to\nsave five, sure” is the dlPFC. But do long-term strategic\nconsequentialism, and all those regions are engaged. And this yields\nsomething more powerful than the cocksureness of knee-jerk\nintuitionism, the “I can’t tell you why, but this is simply wrong.” When\nyou’ve engaged all those brain systems, when you’ve done the thought\nexperiments and feeling experiments of how things might play out in the\nlong run, and when you’ve prioritized the inputs—gut reactions are taken\nseriously, but they’re sure not given veto power—you’ll know exactly\nwhy something seems right or wrong.\nThe synergistic advantages of combining reasoning with intuition\nraise an important point. If you’re a fan of moral intuitions, you’d frame\nthem as being foundational and primordial. If you don’t like them, you’d\npresent them as simplistic, reflexive, and primitive. But as emphasized\nby Woodward and Allman, our moral intuitions are neither primordial\nnor reflexively primitive. They are the end products of learning; they are\ncognitive conclusions to which we have been exposed so often that they\nhave become automatic, as implicit as riding a bicycle or reciting the\ndays of the week forward rather than backward. In the West we nearly all\nhave strong moral intuitions about the wrongness of slavery, child labor,\nintuitions were unrecognizably different. Our guts learn their intuitions.\nSlow and Fast: The Separate Problems of “Me\nVersus Us” and “Us Versus Them”\nThe contrast between rapid, automatic moral intuitionism and\nconscious, deliberative moral reasoning plays out in another crucial\nrealm and is the subject of Greene’s superb 2014 book Moral Tribes:\nEmotion, Reason, and the Gap Between Us and Them.33\nGreene starts with the classic tragedy of the commons. Shepherds\nbring their flocks to a common grazing field. There are so many sheep\nthat there is the danger of destroying the commons, unless people\ndecrease the size of their herds. And the tragedy is that if it is truly a\ncommons, there is no incentive to ever cooperate—you’d range from\nbeing a fool if no one else was cooperating to being a successful free\nrider if everyone else was.\nThis issue, namely how to jump-start and then maintain cooperation\nin a sea of noncooperators, ran through all of chapter 10 and, as shown in\nthe widespread existence of social species that cooperate, this is solvable\n(stay tuned for more in the final chapter). When framed in the context of\nmorality, averting the tragedy of the commons requires getting people in\ngroups to not be selfish; it is an issue of Me versus Us.\nBut Greene outlines a second type of tragedy. Now there are two\ndifferent groups of shepherds, and the challenge is that each group has a\ndifferent approach to grazing. One, for example, treats the pasture as a\nclassic commons, while the other believes that the pasture should be\ndivided up into parcels of land belonging to individual shepherds, with\nhigh, strong fences in between. In other words, mutually contradictory\nviews about using the pasture.\nThe thing that fuels the danger and tragedy of this situation is that\neach group has such a tightly reasoned structure in their heads as to why\ntheir way is correct that it can acquire moral weight, be seen as a “right.”\nGreene dissects that word brilliantly. For each side, perceiving\nforce of their stance; feel in the most sincere, pained way that the very\nessence of what they value and who they are is at stake, that the very\nmoral rightness of the universe is wobbling; all of that so strongly that\nthey can’t recognize the “right” for what it is, namely “I can’t tell you\nwhy, but this is how things should be done.” To cite a quote attributed to\nOscar Wilde, “Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people\nwhom we personally dislike.”\nIt’s Us versus Them framed morally, and the importance of what\nGreene calls “the Tragedy of Commonsense Morality” is shown by the\nfact that most intergroup conflicts on our planet ultimately are cultural\ndisagreements about whose “right” is righter.\nThis is an intellectualized, bloodless way of framing the issue. Here’s\na different way.\nSay I decide that it would be a good thing to have pictures here\ndemonstrating cultural relativism, displaying an act that is\ncommonsensical in one culture but deeply distressing in another. “I\nknow,” I think, “I’ll get some pictures of a Southeast Asian dog-meat\nmarket; like me, most readers will likely resonate with dogs.” Good plan.\nOn to Google Images, and the result is that I spend hours transfixed,\nunable to stop, torturing myself with picture after picture of dogs being\ncarted off to market, dogs being butchered, cooked, and sold, pictures of\nhumans going about their day’s work in a market, indifferent to a crate\nstuffed to the top with suffering dogs.\nI imagine the fear those dogs feel, how they are hot, thirsty, in pain. I\nthink, “What if these dogs had come to trust humans?” I think of their\nfear and confusion. I think, “What if one of the dogs whom I’ve loved\nhad to experience that? What if this happened to a dog my children\nloved?” And with my heart racing, I realize that I hate these people, hate\nevery last one of them and despise their culture.\nAnd it takes a locomotive’s worth of effort for me to admit that I\ncan’t justify that hatred and contempt, that mine is a mere moral\nintuition, that there are things that I do that would evoke the same\nresponse in some distant person whose humanity and morality are\nso tragic is the intensity with which\nyou just know that They are deeply\nwrong.\nIn general, our morally tinged\ncultural institutions—religion,\nnationalism, ethnic pride, team\nspirit—bias us toward our best\nbehaviors when we are single\nshepherds facing a potential tragedy\nof the commons. They make us less\nselfish in Me versus Us situations.\nBut they send us hurtling toward\nour worst behaviors when\nconfronting Thems and their\ndifferent moralities.\nThe dual process nature of moral decision making gives some\ninsights into how to avert these two very different types of tragedies.\nIn the context of Me versus Us, our moral intuitions are shared, and\nemphasizing them hums with the prosociality of our Us-ness. This was\nshown in a study by Greene, David Rand of Yale, and colleagues, where\nsubjects played a one-shot public-goods game that modeled the tragedy\nof the commons.34 Subjects were given differing lengths of time to\ndecide how much money they would contribute to a common pot (versus\nkeeping it for themselves, to everyone else’s detriment). And the faster\nthe decision required, the more cooperative people were. Ditto if you had\nprimed subjects to value intuition (by having them relate a time when\nintuition led them to a good decision or where careful reasoning did the\nopposite)—more cooperation. Conversely, instruct subjects to “carefully\nconsider” their decision, or prime them to value reflection over intuition,\nand they’d be more selfish. The more time to think, the more time to do a\nversion of “Yes, we all agree that cooperation is a good thing . . . but\nhere is why I should be exempt this time”—what the authors called\n“calculated greed.”\nWhat would happen if subjects played the game with someone\ndirection of easy, unconflicted selfishness, with “Them! Them!”\nxenophobia alarms ringing and automatic beliefs of “Don’t trust Them!”\ninstantly triggered.\nWhen facing Me-versus-Us moral dilemmas of resisting selfishness,\nour rapid intuitions are good, honed by evolutionary selection for\ncooperation in a sea of green-beard markers.35 And in such settings,\nregulating and formalizing the prosociality (i.e., moving it from the\nrealm of intuition to that of cogitation) can even be counterproductive, a\npoint emphasized by Samuel Bowles.*\nIn contrast, when doing moral decision making during Us-versus-\nThem scenarios, keep intuitions as far away as possible. Instead, think,\nreason, and question; be deeply pragmatic and strategically utilitarian;\ntake their perspective, try to think what they think, try to feel what they\nfeel. Take a deep breath, and then do it all again.*\nVeracity and Mendacity\nThe question rang out, clear and insistent, a question that could\nnot be ignored or evaded. Chris swallowed once, tried for a voice\nthat was calm and steady, and answered, “No, absolutely not.” It\nwas a bald-faced lie.\nIs this a good thing or bad thing? Well, it depends on what the\nquestion was: (a) “When the CEO gave you the summary, were you\naware that the numbers had been manipulated to hide the third-quarter\nlosses?” asked the prosecutor. (b) “Is this a toy you already have?” asked\nGrandma tentatively. (c) “What did the doctor say? Is it fatal?” (d) “Does\nthis outfit make me look ____ ?” (e) “Did you eat the brownies that were\nfor tonight?” (f) “Harrison, are you harboring the runaway slave named\nJack?” (g) “Something’s not adding up. Are you lying about being at\nwork late last night?” (h) “OMG, did you just cut one?”\nNothing better typifies the extent to which the meanings of our\nbehaviors are context dependent. Same untruth, same concentration on\nabout another person activates the medial PFC (along with the insula).*36\nGiven these complexities, it is no surprise that the biology of honesty\nand duplicity is very muddy.\nAs we saw in chapter 10, the very nature of competitive evolutionary\ngames selects for both deception and vigilance against it. We even saw\nprotoversions of both in social yeast. Dogs attempt to deceive one\nanother, with marginal success—when a dog is terrified, fear\npheromones emanate from his anal scent glands, and it’s not great if the\nguy you’re facing off against knows you’re scared. A dog can’t\nconsciously choose to be deceptive by not synthesizing and secreting\nthose pheromones. But he can try to squelch their dissemination by\nputting a lid on those glands, by putting his tail between his legs—“I’m\nnot scared, no siree,” squeaked Sparky.\nNo surprise, nonhuman primate duplicity takes things to a whole\nother level.37 If there is a good piece of food and a higher-ranking animal\nnearby, capuchins will give predator alarm calls to distract the other\nindividual; if it is a lower-ranking animal, no need; just take the food.\nSimilarly, if a low-ranking capuchin knows where food has been hidden\nand there is a dominant animal around, he will move away from the\nhiding place; if it’s a subordinate animal, no problem. The same is seen\nin spider monkeys and macaques. And other primates don’t just carry out\n“tactical concealment” about food. When a male gelada baboon mates\nwith a female, he typically gives a “copulation call.” Unless he is with a\nfemale who has snuck away from her nearby consortship male. In which\ncase he doesn’t make a sound. And, of course, all of these examples pale\nin comparison with what politico chimps can be up to. Reflecting\ndeception as a task requiring lots of social expertise, across primate\nspecies, a larger neocortex predicts higher rates of deception,\nindependent of group size.*\nThat’s impressive. But it is highly unlikely that there is conscious\nstrategizing on the part of these primates. Or that they feel bad or even\nmorally soiled about being deceptive. Or that they actually believe their\nlies. For those things we need humans.\nThe human capacity for deception is enormous. We have the most\nHumans also excel at lying because our cognitive skills allow us to\ndo something beyond the means of any perfidious gelada baboon—we\ncan finesse the truth.\nA cool study shows our propensity for this. To simplify: A subject\nwould roll a die, with different results yielding different monetary\nrewards. The rolls were made in private, with the subject reporting the\noutcome—an opportunity to cheat.\nGiven chance and enough rolls, if everyone was honest, each number\nwould be reported about one sixth of the time. If everyone always lied\nfor maximal gain, all rolls would supposedly have produced the highest-\npaying number.\nThere was lots of lying. Subjects were over 2,500 college students\nfrom twenty-three countries, and higher rates of corruption, tax evasion,\nand political fraud in a subject’s country predicted higher rates of lying.\nThis is no surprise, after chapter 9’s demonstration that high rates of rule\nviolations in a community decrease social capital, which then fuels\nindividual antisocial behavior.\nWhat was most interesting was that across all the cultures, lying was\nof a particular type. Subjects actually rolled a die twice, and only the first\nroll counted (the second, they were told, tested whether the die was\n“working properly”). The lying showed a pattern that, based on prior\nwork, could be explained by only one thing—people rarely made up a\nhigh-paying number. Instead they simply reported the higher roll of the\ntwo.\nYou can practically hear the rationalizing. “Darn, my first roll was a\n1 [a bad outcome], my second a 4 [better]. Hey, rolls are random; it\ncould just as readily have been 4 as a 1, so . . . let’s just say I rolled a 4.\nThat’s not really cheating.”\nIn other words, lying most often included rationalizing that made it\nfeel less dishonest—not going whole hog for that filthy lucre, so that\nyour actions feel like only slightly malodorous untruthiness.\nWhen we are lying, naturally, regions involved in Theory of Mind\nare involved, particularly with circumstances of strategic social\nright thing to do. And in our value-free sense of “right,” you’d expect the\ndlPFC to activate when you’re struggling to do (a) the morally right\nthing, which is to avoid the temptation to lie, as well as (b) the\nstrategically right thing, namely, once having decided to lie, doing it\neffectively. It can be hard to deceive effectively, having to think\nstrategically, carefully remember what lie you’re actually saying, and\ncreate a false affect (“Your Majesty, I bring terrible, sad news about your\nson, the heir to the throne [yeah, we ambushed him—high fives!]”).*\nThus activation of the dlPFC will reflect both the struggle to resist\ntemptation and the executive effort to wallow effectively in the\ntemptation, once you’ve lost that struggle. “Don’t do it” + “if you’re\ngoing to do it, do it right.”\nThis confusion arises in neuroimaging studies of compulsive liars.*39\nWhat might one expect? These are people who habitually fail to resist\nthe temptation of lying; I bet they have atrophy of something\nfrontocortical. These are people who habitually lie and are good at it\n(and typically have high verbal IQs); I bet they have expansion of\nsomething frontocortical. And the studies bear out both predictions—\ncompulsive liars have increased amounts of white matter (i.e., the axonal\ncables connecting neurons) in the frontal cortex, but lesser amounts of\ngray matter (i.e., the cell bodies of the neurons). It’s not possible to know\nif there’s causality in these neuroimaging/behavior correlates. All one\ncan conclude is that frontocortical regions like the dlPFC show multiple\nand varied versions of “doing the harder thing.”\nYou can dissociate the frontal task of resisting temptation from the\nfrontal task of lying effectively by taking morality out of the equation.40\nThis is done in studies where people are told to lie. (For example,\nsubjects are given a series of pictures; later they are shown an array of\npictures, some of which are identical to ones in their possession, and\nasked, “Is this a picture you have?” A signal from the computer indicates\nwhether the subject should answer honestly or lie.) In this sort of\nscenario, lying is most consistently associated with activation of the\ndlPFC (along with the nearby and related ventrolateral PFC). This is a\ncircumstances of conflicting choices. This occurs for conflict in an\nemotional sense, as well as in a cognitive sense (e.g., having to choose\nbetween two answers when both seem to work). In the lying studies the\nACC isn’t activating because of moral conflict about lying, since\nsubjects were instructed to lie. Instead, it’s monitoring the conflict\nbetween reality and what you’ve been instructed to report, and this gums\nup the works slightly; people show minutely longer response times\nduring lying trials than during honest ones.\nThis delay is useful in polygraph tests (i.e., lie detectors). In the\nclassic form, the test detected arousal of the sympathetic nervous system,\nindicating that someone was lying and anxious about not getting caught.\nThe trouble is that you’d get the same anxious arousal if you’re telling\nthe truth but your life’s over if that fallible machine says otherwise.\nMoreover, sociopaths are undetectable, since they don’t get anxiously\naroused when lying. Plus subjects can take countermeasures to\nmanipulate their sympathetic nervous system. As a result, this use of\npolygraphs is no longer admissible in courts. Contemporary polygraph\ntechniques instead home in on that slight delay, on the physiological\nindices of that ACC conflict—not the moral one, since some miscreant\nmay have no moral misgivings, but the cognitive conflict—“Yeah, I\nrobbed the store, but no, wait, I have to say that I didn’t.” Unless you\nthoroughly believe your lie, there’s likely to be that slight delay,\nreflecting the ACC-ish cognitive conflict between reality and your claim.\nThus, activation of the ACC, dlPFC, and nearby frontal regions is\nassociated with lying on command.41 At this point we have our usual\nissue of causality—is activation of, say, the dlPFC a cause, a\nconsequence, or a mere correlate of lying? To answer this, transcranial\ndirect-current stimulation has been used to inactivate the dlPFC in people\nduring instructed-lying tasks. Result? Subjects were slower and less\nsuccessful in lying—implying a causal role for the dlPFC. And to remind\nus of how complicated this issue is, people with damage to the dlPFC are\nless likely to take honesty into account when honesty and self-interest\nare pitted against each other in an economic game. So this most\nto deceive. For more understanding of that, we turn to a pair of\nthoroughly cool neuroimaging studies where subjects who lied did so not\nbecause they were instructed to but because they were dirty rotten\ncheaters.\nThe first was carried out by the Swiss scientists Thomas\nBaumgartner, Ernst Fehr (whose work has been noted previously), and\ncolleagues.42 Subjects played an economic trust game where, in each\nround, you could be cooperative or selfish. Beforehand a subject would\ntell the other player what their strategy would be\n(always/sometimes/never cooperate). In other words, they made a\npromise.\nSome subjects who promised to always cooperate broke their\npromise at least once. At such times there was activation of the dlPFC,\nthe ACC, and, of course, the amygdala.*43\nA pattern of brain activation before each round’s decision predicted\nbreaking of a promise. Fascinatingly, along with predictable activation of\nthe ACC, there’d be activation of the insula. Does the scoundrel think,\n“I’m disgusted with myself, but I’m going to break my promise”? Or is it\n“I don’t like this guy because of X; in fact, he’s kind of disgusting; I owe\nhim nothing; I’m breaking my promise”? While it’s impossible to tell,\ngiven our tendency to rationalize our own transgressions, I’d bet it’s the\nlatter.\nThe second study comes from Greene and colleague Joseph\nPaxton.44 Subjects in a scanner would predict the outcome of coin tosses,\nearning money for correct guesses. The study’s design contained an extra\nlayer of distracting nonsense. Subjects were told the study was about\nparanormal mental abilities, and for some of the coin tosses, for this\nconcocted reason, rather than state their prediction beforehand, subjects\nwould just think about their choice and then tell afterward if they were\nright. In other words, amid a financial incentive to guess correctly, there\nwere intermittent opportunities to cheat. Crucially, this was detectable—\nduring the periods of forced honesty, subjects averaged a 50 percent\nsuccess rate. And if accuracy jumped a lot higher during opportunities to\ncheat, subjects were probably cheating.\nthe combination of moral and cognitive conflict? Not particularly—there\nwasn’t activation of the ACC, nor was there the slight lag time in\nresponse. Cheaters typically didn’t cheat at every opportunity; what did\nthings look like when they resisted? Here’s where you saw the struggling\n—even greater activation of the dlPFC (along with the vlPFC), the ACC\nroaring into action, and a significant delay in response time. In other\nwords, for people capable of cheating, the occasional resistance seems to\nbe the outcome of major neurobiological Sturm und Drang.\n—\nAnd now for probably the most important finding in this chapter. What\nabout subjects who never cheated? There are two very different\nscenarios, as framed by Greene and Paxton: Is resisting temptation at\nevery turn an outcome of “will,” of having a stoked dlPFC putting Satan\ninto a hammerlock of submission? Or is it an act of “grace,” where\nthere’s no struggle, because it’s simple; you don’t cheat?\nIt was grace. In those who were always honest, the dlPFC, vlPFC,\nand ACC were in veritable comas when the chance to cheat arose.\nThere’s no conflict. There’s no working hard to do the right thing. You\nsimply don’t cheat.\nResisting temptation is as implicit as walking up stairs, or thinking\n“Wednesday” after hearing “Monday, Tuesday,” or as that first piece of\nregulation we mastered way back when, being potty trained. As we saw\nin chapter 7, it’s not a function of what Kohlbergian stage you’re at; it’s\nwhat moral imperatives have been hammered into you with such urgency\nand consistency that doing the right thing has virtually become a spinal\nreflex.\nThis is not to suggest that honesty, even impeccable honesty that\nresists all temptation, can only be the outcome of implicit automaticity.45\nWe can think and struggle and employ cognitive control to produce\nsimilar stainless records, as shown in some subsequent work. But in\ncircumstances like the Greene and Paxton study, with repeated\nopportunities to cheat in rapid succession, it’s not going to be a case of\nchild. “What were you thinking when you decided to go into the house”?\n(Were you thinking about the evolution of cooperation, of reciprocal\naltruism, of game theory and reputation?) And the answer is always “I\nwasn’t thinking anything. Before I knew it, I had run in.” Interviews of\nCarnegie Medal recipients about that moment shows precisely that—a\nfirst, intuitive thought of needing to help, resulting in the risking of life\nwithout a second thought. “Heroism feels and never reasons,” to quote\nEmerson.46\nIt’s the same thing here: “Why did you never cheat? Is it because of\nyour ability to see the long-term consequences of cheating becoming\nnormalized, or your respect for the Golden Rule, or . . . ?” The answer is\n“I don’t know [shrug]. I just don’t cheat.” This isn’t a deontological or a\nconsequentialist moment. It’s virtue ethics sneaking in the back door in"

    "content": "Feeling Someone’s Pain,\nUnderstanding Someone’s\nPain, Alleviating\nSomeone’s Pain\nperson is in pain, frightened, or crushed with a malignant sadness.\nAnd another human, knowing that, is likely to experience something\nabsolutely remarkable—an aversive state that is approximated by the\nword “empathy.” As we’ll see in this chapter, it is a state on a continuum\nwith what occurs in a baby or in another species. The state takes varied\nforms, with varied underlying biology, reflecting its sensorimotor,\nemotional, and cognitive building blocks. Various logical influences\nsharpen or dull the state. All leading to this chapter’s two key questions:\nDISTINCTIONS\nmpathy, sympathy, compassion, mimicry, emotional contagion,\nsensorimotor contagion, perspective taking, concern, pity. Let the\nterminology and squabbles begin over definitions of ways in which we\nresonate with someone else’s adversity (along with the question of\nwhether the opposite of such resonance is gloating pleasure or\nindifference).\nWe start with, for want of a better word, primitive versions of\nresonating with someone’s pain. There’s sensorimotor contagion—you\nsee a hand poked with a needle, and the part of your sensory cortex that\nmaps onto your hand activates, sensitizing you to the imagined sensation.\nPerhaps your motor cortex will also activate, causing you to compress\nyour own hand. Or you watch a tightrope walker and involuntarily put\nyour arms out for balance. Or someone has a coughing fit, and your\nthroat constricts.\nEven more explicitly motoric is the act of matching movements with\nsimple mimicry. Or there’s emotional contagion, the automatic transfer\nof strong emotive states—such as one baby crying because another is, or\nsomeone catching the fever of a mob plunging into a riot.\nYour resonance with someone’s plight can carry an implicit power\ndifferential. You can pity someone in pain—recalling Fiske’s categories\nof Thems in chapter 11, this belittling pity means you view the person as\nhigh in warmth and low in competence and agency. And we all know the\neveryday meaning of “sympathy” (“Look, I sympathize with your\nsituation, but . . .”); you have the power to alleviate their distress but\nchoose not to.\nThen there are terms reflecting how much your resonance is about\nemotion versus cognition. In that sense “sympathy” means you feel sorry\nfor someone else’s pain without understanding it. In contrast, “empathy”\nelse’s distress. There’s the emotionally distanced sense of sympathy, of\nfeeling for someone. There’s the rawer, vicarious state of feeling their\npain as if it were happening to you. And then there is the more\ncognitively distanced state of perspective taking, of imagining what this\nmust be like for her, not you. As we’ll see, an as-if state carries the\ndanger that you experience her pain so intensely that your primary\nconcern becomes alleviating your own distress.\nWhich raises a different word—“compassion,” where your resonance\nwith someone’s distress leads you to actually help.1\nPerhaps most important, these words are generally about inwardly\nmotivated states—you can’t force someone to truly feel empathy, can’t\ninduce it in them with guilt or a sense of obligation. You can generate\nersatz versions of it those ways, but not the real thing. Consistent with\nthat, some recent work shows that when you help someone out of\nempathy, there is a very different profile of brain activation from when\nyou do so out of an obliged sense of reciprocity.2\nAs usual, we gain insights into the nature and biology of these states\nCOMPASSIONATE ANIMALS\nots of animals display building blocks of empathic states (I use\n“empathic state” throughout the chapter when referring to the\ncollectivity of sympathy, empathy, compassion, etc.). There’s mimicry, a\ncornerstone of social learning in many species—think young chimps\nwatching Mom to learn to use tools. Ironically, humans’ strong proclivity\nfor imitation can have a downside. In one study chimps and children\nobserved an adult human repeatedly accessing a treat inside a puzzle\nbox; crucially, the person added various extraneous movements. When\nexploring the box themselves afterward, chimps imitated only the steps\nneeded to open it, whereas kids “overimitated,” copying the superfluous\ngestures as well.*3\nSocial animals are also constantly buffeted with emotional contagion\n—shared states of arousal in a pack of dogs or male chimps going on a\nborder patrol. These are not terribly precise states, often spilling over\ninto other behaviors. For example, say some baboons flush out\nsomething good to eat—say, a young gazelle. The gazelle is running like\nhell, with these baboons in pursuit. And then the male in front seems to\nthink something along the lines of “Well, here I am running fast and—\nWHAT? There’s my hated rival running right behind me! Why’s that jerk\nchasing me?” He spins around for a head-on collision and fight with the\nbaboon behind him, gazelle forgotten.\nMimicry and emotional contagion are baby steps. Do other animals\nfeel one another’s pain? Sort of. Mice can learn a specific fear\nassociation vicariously by observing another mouse experiencing the fear\nconditioning. Moreover, this is a social process—learning is enhanced if\nthe mice are related or have mated.4\nIn another study a mouse would be exposed to an aggressive intruder\nplaced in its cage.5 As shown previously, this produces persistent adverse\nconsequences—a month later, such mice still had elevated glucocorticoid\nAn even more striking demonstration of “your pain is my pain” in\nanother species came in a 2006 Science paper from Jeff Mogil of McGill\nUniversity.6 A mouse would observe another mouse (separated from it\nby Plexiglas) in pain, and, as a result, its own pain sensitivity increased.*\nIn another part of the study, an irritant would be injected in a mouse’s\npaw; mice typically lick their paw at that point, with the amount of\nlicking indicating the amount of discomfort. Thus, X amount of the\nirritant would produce Z amount of licking. However, if the mouse was\nsimultaneously observing a mouse who had been exposed to more than\nX amount of irritant and who thus was licking more than Z amount, the\nsubject mouse would lick more than usual. Conversely, if the subject\nobserved a mouse licking less (having been exposed to less than X\namount of irritant), it would also lick less. Thus the amount of pain a\nmouse was feeling was modulated by the amount of pain a nearby mouse\nwas. Importantly, this was a social phenomenon—this shared pain only\noccurred between mice that were cagemates.*\nObviously we can’t know the internal state of these animals. Were\nthey feeling bad for the other mouse in pain, feeling “for” or “as if,”\ntaking the other mouse’s perspective? Pretty unlikely, making the use of\nthe word “empathy” in this literature controversial.7\nHowever, we can observe overt behavior. Do other species\nproactively lessen the distress of another individual? Yes.\nAs we will see in the final chapter, numerous species show\n“reconciliative” behavior, where two individuals, soon after a negative\ninteraction, show higher-than-chance levels of affiliative behaviors\n(grooming, sitting in contact) between them, and this decreases the odds\nof subsequent tensions between them. As shown by de Waal and\ncolleagues, chimps also show third-party “consolation” behavior. This is\nnot when, after two individuals fight, some bleeding-heart chimp\nindiscriminately nices both of them. Instead the consoler is preferentially\naffiliative to the victim over the initiator of the fight. This reflects both a\ncognitive component of tracking who started a tension and an affective\ndesire to comfort. Similar consolation, focused on fight victims, also\nConsolation is also shown among those heartwarming pair-bonding\nprairie voles, as shown in a 2016 Nature paper from Larry Young of\nEmory University, a pioneer of the vole/monogamy/vasopressin story,\nalong with de Waal.9 Members of a vole pair would be placed in separate\nrooms. One of the pair would be either stressed (with a mild shock) or\nleft undisturbed; pairs were then reunited. As compared with unstressed\nindividuals, stressed ones would be licked and groomed more by their\npartner. Partners would also match the anxiety behaviors and\nglucocorticoid levels of their stressed pairmate. This didn’t occur for a\nstressed stranger, nor among polygamous meadow voles. As we’ll see,\nthe neurobiology of this effect is all about oxytocin and the anterior\ncingulate cortex.\nAnimals will intervene even more proactively. In one study rats\nworked more (pressing a lever) to lower a distressed rat, dangling in the\nair in a harness, than a suspended block. In another study rats proactively\nworked to release a cagemate from a stressful restrainer. Subjects were as\nmotivated to do this as to get chocolate (nirvana for rats). Moreover,\nwhen a rat could both release the cagemate and get chocolate, they’d\nshare it more than half the time.10\nThis prosociality had an Us/Them component. The authors\nsubsequently showed that rats would work to release even a strange rat—\nso long as it was of the same strain and thus nearly genetically\nidentical.11 Is this automatic Us/Them-ing built on the genetics of shared\npheromone signatures (back to chapter 10)? No—if a rat is housed with a\ncagemate of another strain, it will help individuals of that other strain.\nAnd if a rat is switched at birth and raised by a female of another strain,\nit helps members of its adopted but not its biological strain. “Us” is\nmalleable by experience, even among rodents.\nWhy do all these animals labor away consoling another individual in\ndistress, or even helping them? It’s probably not conscious application of\nthe Golden Rule, and it’s not necessarily for the social benefits—rats\nwere just as likely to release cagemates from restrainers even if they\ndidn’t get to interact afterward. Maybe it’s something resembling\n525\nto work to lower him so he’ll shut up.” Scratch an altruistic rat and a\nhypocrite bleeds.\n\nCOMPASSIONATE CHILDREN\nrecap of material covered in chapters 6 and 7:\nAs we saw, a developmental landmark is attaining Theory of\nMind, something necessary but not sufficient for empathy, which paves\nthe way for increasing abstraction. The capacity for simple sensorimotor\ncontagion matures into empathic states for someone’s physical pain and,\nlater, for someone’s emotional pain. There’s the progression from feeling\nsorry for an individual (e.g., someone homeless) to feeling sorry for a\ncategory (e.g., “homeless people”). There is increasing cognitive\nsophistication, as kids first distinguish between harming an object and\nharming a person. Likewise for distinguishing between intentional and\nunintentional harm, along with a capacity for moral indignation that is\nmore readily evoked by the former. Along with this comes a capacity to\nexpress empathy and a sense of responsibility to act upon it, to be\nproactively compassionate. Perspective taking matures as well, as the\nchild transitions from solely being capable of feeling “for” to also feeling\n“as if.”\nAs we saw, the neurobiology of this developmental arc makes sense.\nAt the age where an empathic state is evoked only by someone’s physical\npain, brain activation centers on the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a fairly\nlow-level way station in the brain’s pain circuitry. Once emotional pain\ncan evoke an empathic state, the profile is mostly about coupled\nactivation between the (emotional) vmPFC and limbic structures. As the\ncapacity for moral indignation matures, coupling among the vmPFC, the\ninsula, and amygdala emerges. And as perspective taking comes into\nplay, the vmPFC is increasingly coupled to regions associated with\nTheory of Mind (like the temporoparietal junction).\nThis was our picture of empathic states in kids being built upon the\ncognitive foundation of Theory of Mind and perspective taking. But as\nwe also saw, there are empathic states earlier on—infants showing\n527\njust as with empathic states in other animals, one must ask whether\ncompassion in kids is mostly about ending the sufferer’s distress or\nending their own.\n\nhis again. We can predict the major punch lines, thanks to the\nprevious three chapters: both cognitive and affective components\ncontribute to healthy empathic states; it’s silly to debate which is more\nimportant; what’s interesting is seeing when one predominates over the\nother. Even more interesting is to look at the neurobiology of how those\ncomponents interact.\nThe Affective Side of Things\nWhen it comes to empathy, all neurobiological roads pass through\nthe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As introduced in chapter 2, this\nfrontal cortical structure has starred in empathy neuroscience ever since\npeople felt someone else’s pain while inside a brain scanner.12\nGiven its more traditional roles in mammals, the ACC’s empathy\nconnection is unexpected. Broadly, those roles are:\nProcessing interoceptive information. As introduced in\nchapter 3, our brains monitor sensory information not\nonly from outside us but from our internal world as well\n—interoceptive information about achy muscles, dry\nmouths, bowels in an uproar. If you unconsciously sense\nthat your heart is racing and that makes you experience\nsome emotion more intensely, thank the ACC. The ACC\nfunnels literal gut feelings into intuitions and\nmetaphorical gut feelings influencing frontal function.\nPain is a key type of interoceptive information that\ncatches the ACC’s attention.13\nConflict monitoring. The ACC responds to “conflict” in\nthe sense of a discrepancy from what is expected. If you\nassociate doing some behavior with a particular\nthree instead, and the ACC perks up and takes notice; do\nthe task and instead of two brownie points you only get\none, and the ACC activates like mad. In the words of\nKevin Ochsner of Columbia University and colleagues,\nthe ACC is an “all-purpose alarm that signals when\nongoing behavior has hit a snag.”14\nUnexpected pain is at the intersection of those two roles of the ACC,\na sure sign that things are amiss with your schema about the world. Even\nwith anticipated pain, you monitor whether it turns out to be of the\nquality and quantity expected. As noted, the ACC doesn’t concern itself\nwith pedestrian concerns about pain (is it my finger or my toe that\nhurts?); that’s the purview of less refined, more ancient brain circuitry.\nWhat the ACC cares about is the meaning of the pain. Good news or bad,\nand of what nature? Thus the ACC’s perception of pain can be\nmanipulated. Poke your finger with a pin and the ACC activates, along\nwith those brain regions telling you which finger and what parameters of\npain. Make someone believe that the inert cream you just smeared on his\nfinger is a powerful painkiller, and when you poke his finger, the “it’s my\nfinger, not my toe” circuitry still activates. But the ACC falls for the\nplacebo effect and stays silent.\nObviously the ACC receives inputs from interoceptive and\nexteroceptive outposts. Equally logically, it sends lots of projections into\nthe sensorimotor cortex, making you very aware of and focused on the\nbody part that hurts.\nBut the sophistication of the ACC, the reason it sits up there in the\nfrontal cortex, is apparent when considering another type of pain. Back\nto chapter 6 and the Cyberball game where subjects in brain scanners\nplay catch with a virtual ball on a computer screen, tossing it back and\nforth, and the other two players stop throwing the ball to you. You’re\nbeing left out, and the ACC activates. Insofar as the ACC cares about the\nmeaning of pain, it’s just as concerned with the abstractions of social and\nemotional pain—social exclusion, anxiety, disgust, embarrassment—as\nwith physical pain. Intriguingly, major depression is associated with\nNonetheless, numerous studies consistently show that if someone else’s\npain—a poked finger, a sad face, a tale of misfortune—is evoking an\nempathic state in you, the ACC is involved.16 Moreover, the more\npainful the other person’s situation seems to be, the more ACC\nactivation. The ACC is also central to doing something to alleviate\nsomeone else’s distress.\nThe neuropeptide/hormone oxytocin gets into the mix. Recall from\nchapter 4 how it promotes bonding and affiliative behaviors, trust, and\ngenerosity.* Recall the study in which prairie voles are observed\nconsoling their stressed partner. And we’d expect, the effect depends on\nthe actions of oxytocin. Remarkably, the oxytocin works in the ACC—\nselectively block oxytocin effects in the ACC, and voles don’t console.\nSo how do we go from the ACC as this outpost of self-interest,\nmonitoring your pain and whether you are getting what you think you\ndeserve, to the ACC allowing you to feel the pain of the wretched of the\nearth? I think the link is a key issue of this chapter—how much is an\nempathic state actually about yourself?17 “Ouch, that hurt” is a good way\nto learn not to repeat whatever you just did. But often, even better is to\nmonitor someone else’s misfortune—“That sure seems to have hurt her;\nI’m staying away from doing that.” Crucially, the ACC is essential for\nlearning fear and conditioned avoidance by observation alone. Going\nfrom “She seems to be having a miserable time” to “Thus I should avoid\nthat” requires an intervening step of shared representation of self: “Like\nher, I wouldn’t enjoy feeling that way.” Feeling someone else’s pain can\nbe more effective for learning than just knowing that they’re in pain. At\nits core the ACC is about self-interest, with caring about that other\nperson in pain as an add-on.\nOther brain regions are pertinent as well. As we saw, maturation of\nthe circuitry of empathy involves bringing into the mix not only the ACC\nbut the insula as well.18 By adulthood the insula (and to a lesser degree\nthe amygdala) is nearly as intertwined with experiencing empathy as is\nthe ACC. The three regions are highly interconnected, and a big chunk of\nthe amygdala texting the frontal cortex is funneled through the ACC.\nNumerous circumstances that evoke a sense of empathy, particularly\nThis makes sense, given the workings of the insula and amygdala. As\nwe saw, their involvement in empathic states emerges developmentally\nas kids first embed empathy in context and causality—why is this person\nin pain, and whose fault is it? This is obvious when pain is rooted in\ninjustice, when disgust, indignation, and anger sweep in because we\nknow that this pain could have been prevented, that someone profited\nfrom it. Even when it is unclear that a cause of pain lies in injustice, we\nseek attribution—the intertwining of the ACC with the insula and\namygdala is our world of scapegoating. And that pattern is so often there\neven when pain is random, without human agency or villainy—literal or\nmetaphorical tectonic plates shift, the earth opens up and swallows\nsomeone innocent, and we rail against the people who deprived that\nvictim of a happier life before the tragedy struck, against the God behind\nthis act of God, against the mechanistic indifference of the universe. And\nas we will see, the more the purity of empathy is clouded with the anger,\ndisgust, and indignation of blame, the harder it is to actually help.\nThe Cognitive Side of Things\nWhen do the more cognitive components of an empathic state—the\nPFC, the dlPFC in particular, along with Theory of Mind networks such\nas the temporoparietal juncture (TPJ) and superior central sulcus—come\nmore to the forefront? Obviously, and uninterestingly, when it’s\nchallenging to even figure out what’s going on—“Wait, who won the\ngame?” “Do I want my pieces to surround or be surrounded by the other\nperson’s?”\nMore interesting is when more cognitive brain circuitry is recruited\nby issues of causation and intentionality: “Wait, does he have a horrible\nheadache because he’s a migrant farm worker who was sprayed with\npesticide, or because he’s been binge drinking with his frat bros?” “Did\nthis AIDS patient get his HIV from a blood transfusion or drug use?\n(People show more activation of the ACC for the former.) This is\nprecisely what chimps have thought through when comforting an\ninnocent victim of aggression but not an instigator. As we saw in chapter\nattitudes toward other people.”19 In other words, cognitive processes\nserve as a gatekeeper, deciding whether a particular misfortune is worthy\nof empathy.\nIt is also a cognitive task to resonate with pain that is less overt—for\nexample, there is more engagement of the dmPFC when observing\nsomeone in emotional pain than physical pain. Likewise when the pain is\npresented more abstractly—a signal on a screen indicating that\nsomeone’s hand has been stuck with a needle versus the act itself being\nshown. Resonating with someone else’s pain is also a cognitive task\nwhen it is a type of pain that you haven’t experienced. “Well, I suppose I\ncan understand the disappointment of this militia leader when he was\npassed over for the chance to carry out the ethnic cleansing—kinda like\nwhen I lost the election in kindergarten to be president of the random-\nact-of-kindness club.” Now, that takes cognitive work. In one study\nsubjects considered people suffering from a neurological disorder\ninvolving a novel type of pain sensitivity; empathizing for that novel\npain involved more frontal cortical activation than for more conventional\npain.20\nAs we saw, the rudimentary “empathy” of rodents is contingent,\ndepending on whether the other individual is a cagemate or a stranger.21\nIt is an enormous cognitive task for humans to overcome that, to reach an\nempathic state for someone who is different, unappealing. A hospital\nchaplain once described to me how he has to actively make sure that he\nis not preferentially visiting patients who were “YAVIS”—young,\nattractive, verbal, intelligent, or social. This is straight out of Us versus\nThem—recall Susan Fiske’s work showing how extreme out-group\nmembers, such as the homeless or addicts, are processed differently in\nthe frontal cortex than other people. And it is also straight out of Josh\nGreene’s tragedy of the commons versus tragedy of the commonsense\nmorality, where acting morally toward an Us is automatic, while doing\nso for a Them takes work.\nThe ease of empathizing with people like us starts at the level of\nautonomic building blocks of empathy—in one study of ritual fire\nwalkers in Spain, heart rate changes in the walkers synchronized with\nThis extends to broader versions of Us versus Them. As introduced\nin chapter 3, we have a stronger sensorimotor response in our hands\nwhen the hand we see being poked with a needle is of our race; the\nstronger one’s implicit in-group bias, the stronger this effect. Meanwhile,\nother studies show that the stronger the discrepancy in patterns of neural\nactivation when observing an in-group versus an out-group person in\npain, the lower the chances of helping the latter.23 Thus it’s no surprise\nthat feeling the same degree of empathy or achieving the same level of\nperspective taking for a Them as for an Us requires greater frontocortical\nactivation. This is the domain where you must suppress the automatic\nand implicit urges to be indifferent, if not repulsed, and do the creative,\nmotivated work of finding the affective commonalities.*24\nCategorical boundaries to the extension of empathy also run along\nsocioeconomic lines, but in an asymmetrical manner. What does that\nmean? That when it comes to empathy and compassion, rich people tend\nto suck. This has been explored at length in a series of studies by Dacher\nKeltner of UC Berkeley. Across the socioeconomic spectrum, on the\naverage, the wealthier people are, the less empathy they report for people\nin distress and the less compassionately they act. Moreover, wealthier\npeople are less adept at recognizing other people’s emotions and in\nexperimental settings are greedier and more likely to cheat or steal. Two\nof the findings were picked up by the media as irresistible: (a) wealthier\npeople (as assessed by the cost of the car they were driving) are less\nlikely than poor people to stop for pedestrians at crosswalks; (b) suppose\nthere’s a bowl of candy in the lab; invite test subjects, after they finish\ndoing some task, to grab some candy on the way out, telling them that\nwhatever’s left over will be given to some kids—the wealthier take more\ncandy.25\nSo do miserable, greedy, unempathic people become wealthy, or does\nbeing wealthy increase the odds of a person’s becoming that way? As a\ncool manipulation, Keltner primed subjects to focus either on their\nsocioeconomic success (by asking them to compare themselves with\npeople less well off than them) or on the opposite. Make people feel\nwealthy, and they take more candy from children.\nindependence—all great ways to decide that someone else’s distress is\nbeneath your notice or concern.\nIt is a particularly uphill battle when we are asked to empathize with\nthe pain of people we dislike, whom we morally disapprove of—\nremember how their misfortune doesn’t simply fail to activate the ACC\nbut instead it activates mesolimbic dopamine reward pathways. Thus the\nprocess of taking their perspective and feeling their pain (as other than\ngrounds for gloating) is a dramatic cognitive challenge rather than\nsomething remotely automatic.26\nThe cognitive “costs” of empathizing with someone distant are\nshown by increasing people’s cognitive load (i.e., making their frontal\ncortex work harder by forcing it to override a habitual behavior)—they\nbecome less helpful to strangers but not to family members. “Empathy\nfatigue” can thus be viewed as the state when the cognitive load of\nrepeated exposure to the pain of Thems whose perspective is challenging\nto take has exhausted the frontal cortex. The notions of cognitive work\nand load also help explain why people are more charitable when\ncontemplating one person in need than a group. To quote Mother Teresa,\n“If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.” Or to\ncite a quote attributed to someone who never seems to have achieved\nenough empathy to be vulnerable to empathy fatigue, Joseph Stalin:\n“The death of one man is a tragedy; the death of millions is a statistic.”27\nAnd probably most reliably, those mentalizing pathways are\nactivated when we switch from focusing on what it would feel like if this\nwere happening to us to focusing on what it must feel like for them. Thus\nwhen subjects are instructed to switch from first- to third-person\nperspective, there’s not just activation of the TPJ but also frontal\nactivation with the top-down regulatory task “Stop thinking about\nyourself.”28\nThus we have themes that closely resemble those from the last few\nchapters. When it comes to empathic states, “emotion” and “cognition”\nare totally false dichotomies; you need both, but with the balance\nbetween the two shifting on a continuum, and the cognition end of it has\nto do the heavy lifting when the differences between you and the person\nn the early 1990s scientists at the University of Parma in Italy, led by\nGiacomo Rizzolatti and Vittorio Gallese, reported something that,\ndepending on your tastes, ranged from really interesting to revolutionary.\nThey had been studying an area of the brain called the premotor cortex\n(PMC) in rhesus monkeys, examining what sorts of stimuli would cause\nindividual neurons there to activate. Back to the PMC from chapter 2.\n“Executive” neurons in the PFC decide something, passing the news to\nthe rest of the frontal cortex just behind it. Which sends projections to\nthe PMC just behind it. Which sends projections one step further back, to\nthe motor cortex, which then sends commands to muscles. Thus the\nPMC straddles the divide between thinking about and carrying out a\nmovement.29\nThe group had discovered some mighty quirky PMC neurons.\nSuppose a monkey carried out a behavior—grasping some food and\nbringing it to her mouth. Naturally, some neurons in the PMC would\nhave activated. If she did a different movement—grasping an object and\nplacing it in a container—a different (partially overlapping) array of\nPMC neurons were involved. What the group reported was that some of\nthe bring-food-to-mouth neurons would also activate if the monkey\nobserved someone else (monkey or human) making that movement.\nSame for some of the place-object-in-container neurons. Same for subtler\nmovements like facial expressions. Consistently, about 10 percent of the\nPMC neurons devoted to doing movement X also activated when\nobserving someone else doing movement X—very odd for neurons a few\nsteps away from commanding muscles to move. The neurons were\nconcerned with the mirroring of movements. And thus were “mirror\nneurons” announced to the world.\nNaturally, everyone looked for mirror neurons in humans, and their\nexistence in roughly the same part of the brain*30 was soon inferred with\nbrain imaging studies (“inferred” because that approach tells you about\nthe activity of large numbers of neurons at a time, rather than single\nsound of someone doing movement A, and the same occurs. And the\nneurons can gestalt a scene, firing even if only part of the observed\nmovement is obscured.32\nMost interesting, mirror neurons didn’t simply track movement. Find\na mirror neuron that responds to the sight of someone picking up a cup of\ntea to drink. The sight of someone picking up the tea to clear the table\ndoesn’t activate it. In other words, mirror neurons can incorporate\nintentionality into their response.\nThus mirror neuron activity correlates with circumstances of\nimitation, either conscious or otherwise, including imitating the idea of\nan action, as well as the intent behind it. Nevertheless, no one has\nactually shown a causal relationship, that automatic or conscious\nmimicry requires mirror neuron activation. Moreover, the mirror\nneuron/imitation link is complicated by the cells having been first\nidentified in rhesus monkeys—a species that does not show imitation of\nbehavior.\nBut assuming that mirror neurons are indeed involved, the question\nbecomes what purpose mimicry serves. Various possibilities have been\nraised and debated.\n—\nProbably the least controversial and most plausible is that mirror neurons\nmediate motor learning by observation.33 Downsides of this theory,\nthough, are that (a) mirror neurons do their thing in species with minimal\nlearning by mimicry; (b) the amount of mirror neuron activity is\nunrelated to the efficacy with which observational learning of\nmovements occurs; (c) to the extent that mirror neurons are needed for\ntypes of observational learning, it’s a pretty low-level contribution in\nhumans—after all, while we do learn how to carry out certain motoric\nacts by observation, far more interesting is our learning of context by\nobservation—when to carry out that behavior (for example,\nobservational learning may teach a subordinate primate the motoric\nfeatures of kowtowing, but far more demanding and important is\nlearning whom to kowtow to).\nmake more vivid your understanding that you should probably avoid that\nfood. This is an idea advocated by Gregory Hickok of the University of\nCalifornia at Irvine, who, as we’ll see, is a hard-nosed critic of mirror\nneuron flights of fancy.\nThis harks back to chapter 2 and Antonio Damasio’s influential\nsomatic marker hypothesis, the idea that when we are choosing among\ndifficult options, the frontal cortex runs as-if experiments, canvassing\nyour mind’s and body’s responses to doing X or Y—a thought\nexperiment combined with a (gut) feeling experiment. Mirror neurons,\nwith their putative attunement to how things worked out for observed\nindividuals, would certainly weigh into this process.\nThus mirror neurons might be useful for learning the meaning of a\nmovement, how to carry it out more effectively, and the consequences\nfor someone else who did it. Nonetheless, such neuronal activity is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for observational learning, especially of\nthe most interesting, abstract human kinds.\nThen there’s the next, more controversial realm, namely the idea that\nmirror neurons help you understand what someone else is thinking. This\ncan range from understanding what behavior they are doing to\nunderstanding why they are doing it to grasping their larger motivations,\nall the way to peering into their souls with your mirror neurons. You can\nsee why this has spawned debates.\nIn this view mirror neurons aid Theory of Mind, mind reading, and\nperspective taking, suggesting that part of how we understand someone\nelse’s world is by simulating (in our minds, in our PMC, in our mirror\nneurons) their actions.35 This orients a mirror neuron’s world in a very\ndifferent way from the previous section, where mirroring is to improve\nyour own motor performance and the most pertinent neuroanatomy about\nmirror neurons in the PMC is their talking to motor neurons that\ncommand muscles. In contrast, mirror neurons being concerned with\nunderstanding someone else’s actions should be talking to Theory of\nMind–related brain regions, for which there is evidence.\nThere was also the suggestion that mirror neuron–mediated\nperspective taking is particularly concerned with social interactions.\ntransparent barrier between the observer and observed. In Gallese’s\nwords, “this shows the relevance of mirror neurons when mapping the\npotentialities for competition or cooperation between agent and\nobserver.”\nThe notion that mirror neurons aid us in understanding someone\nelse’s actions, leading to our understanding someone else, period, has\nbeen heavily criticized on two grounds, most notably by Hickok. First is\nthe issue of causality—while some studies show that mirror neuron\nactivity correlates with attempts at understanding someone else’s\nperspective, there is minimal evidence that such activity causes the\nunderstanding. The second criticism concerns something obvious: we\ncan understand the intent behind someone else’s actions even if we can’t\nremotely perform them ourselves. This would apply to actions of the\nobserved individual ranging from pole-vaulting eighteen feet to\nexplaining special relativity.\nSupporters of this role for mirror neurons admit this but argue that\nthey provide an extra level of understanding. Gallese writes, “I submit\nthat it is only through the activation of Mirror Neurons that we can grasp\nthe meaning of other’s behavior from within”37 (my emphasis). This is\nnot my area of research, and I’m not trying to be snarky, but it seems like\nhe’s saying that there’s understanding and then there’s super-duper\nunderstanding, and the latter requires mirror neurons.\n—\nThese mirror neuron speculations have been extended to focus on\nautism, a disorder in which there are profound impairments in\nunderstanding other people’s actions and intentions.38 According to the\n“broken mirror” hypothesis of mirror neuron pioneer Marco Iacoboni of\nUCLA, mirror neuron dysfunction underlies those aspects of autism.\nThis has been examined by scads of researchers, with findings varying\ndepending on the paradigm; most meta-analyses conclude that there is\nnothing flagrantly wrong with the formal features of mirror neuron\nfunction in autistic individuals.\nThus, while mirror neurons’ activity correlates with attempts to\nfrom within, I think things are best summarized by the title of Hickok’s\nwell-received 2014 book The Myth of Mirror Neurons.39\nWhich leads to the Wild West of mirror neuron–ology, with\nspeculations that mirror neurons are essential to language, aesthetics,\nconsciousness.40 Most of all, within two seconds of people first hearing\nabout mirror neurons, they started writing reviews where the last\nparagraph would say something like “Wow, mirror neurons! How cool is\nthat? This opens up all sorts of interesting avenues. Maybe they even\nexplain . . . EMPATHY!”\nSure, why not? Feeling someone’s pain is like mirroring their\nexperience, feeling as if you are them. Tailor made, an irresistible idea.\nAnd in the decades since mirror neurons’ discovery, the “maybe they\neven explain empathy” reviews have continued. Gallese, for example,\nnearly twenty years into the mirror neuron era, speculates: “I proposed\nthe mirroring could be a basic functional principle of our brain and that\nour capacity to empathize with others might be mediated by embodied\nstimulation mechanisms [i.e., mirroring].” Iacoboni, at the same time,\nwrites, “Mirror neurons are likely cellular candidates for the core layer of\nempathy.” There have been some supportive hints—for example, people\nwho self-report being particularly empathic show stronger mirror\nneuron–esque responses to matching movements. But for skeptics\neverything else is mere speculation.41\nThat’s disappointing. But worse is people skipping over the “maybe”\nand concluding that mirror neurons have been proven to mediate\nempathy. Iacoboni, for example, mistakes correlation for causality:\n“Other studies, however, show that [PMC] activity correlates with\nempathy even when subjects watch grasping actions without overt\nemotional content. Thus, the mirror neuron activity is a prerequisite for\nexperiencing empathy (my emphasis).”42\nA flagrant example of this is the neuroscientist Vilayanur\nRamachandran of UC San Diego, one of the most flamboyantly creative\npeople in the business, doing fascinating research on phantom limbs,\nsynesthesia, and out-of-body experiences. He’s brilliant but has gotten a\nbit giddy with mirror neurons. A sampling: “We know that my mirror\nRamachandran, but how can you resist someone brilliant handing out\nsound bites like calling mirror neurons “Gandhi neurons”? And this\nwasn’t just in the first heady days of mirror neurons in the early 1990s.\nTwo decades later he stated, “I don’t think [the importance of mirror\nneurons for empathy is] being exaggerated. I think they’re being played\ndown, actually.”43\nRamachandran is certainly not alone. British philosopher Anthony\nGrayling has gone for the empathy link big time, writing, “We have a\ngreat gift for empathy. This is a biologically evolved capacity, as shown\nby the function of ‘mirror neurons.’” In a 2007 New York Times article\nabout one man’s heroic actions to save another, those cells featured\nagain: “People have ‘mirror neurons,’ which make them feel what\nsomeone else is experiencing” (emphasis added). And of course there\nwas my daughter’s six-year-old classmate who, upon the class being\ncomplimented by their teacher for caring about the planet and cleaning\nup after their Earth Day cupcake celebration, shouted out, “It’s because\nour neurons have mirrors.”44\nI’d like to think that I’m being a maverick here, ahead of the crowd\nin terms of crucial thinking, but in recent years most in the field have\ncharged overhype. Psychologist Gary Marcus of NYU calls mirror\nneurons “the most oversold idea in psychology,” philosopher and\nneuroscientist Patricia Churchland of UCSD calls them the “darling of\nthe don’t-look-too-closely crew,” and Harvard’s Stephen Pinker\nconcludes, “Mirror neurons do not, in fact, explain language, empathy,\nSOMETHING\nhe previous chapter considered the world of difference between\nhighfalutin moral reasoning and whether, at a crucial juncture,\nsomeone actually does the right thing. As we saw, there is something\nconsistent about that latter type of person: “What were you thinking\nwhen you leaped into that river to save the child?” “I wasn’t; before I\nknew it, I’d jumped in.” An act of implicit automaticity, the product of a\nchildhood in which doing the right thing was ingrained as an automatic,\nmoral imperative, light-years away from the frontal cortex calculating\ncosts and benefits.\nWe face a similar situation here, one that is the core of this chapter.\nSympathy versus empathy, “for” versus “as if,” affect versus cognition,\nwhat we do versus what other species do—does any of this actually\npredict who does something compassionate to lessen someone’s pains?\nSimilarly, does any of this predict whether the person acting\ncompassionately acts effectively, and how much it’s an act of self-\ninterest? As we’ll see, there is a yawning gap between being in an\nempathic state and acting effectively in a way that is truly selfless.\nDoing Something\nIt is far from guaranteed that an empathic state leads to a\ncompassionate act. One reason for this is captured superbly by the\nessayist Leslie Jamison:\n[Empathy] can also offer a dangerous sense of completion: that\nsomething has been done because something has been felt. It is\ntempting to think that feeling someone’s pain is necessarily\nIn such a situation, saying “I feel your pain,” becomes a New Age\nequivalent of the unhelpful bureaucrat saying, “Look, I sympathize with\nyour situation, but . . .” The former is so detached from action that it\ndoesn’t even require the “but” as a bridge to the “there’s nothing I\ncan/will do.” Having your pain validated is swell; having it alleviated is\nbetter.\nAnd there’s a broader reason why an empathic state may not produce\naction, first raised in chapter 6 when considering those strange creatures,\nadolescents. In that discussion I emphasized a wonderful feature of so\nmany adolescents, namely the frenzied feeling of the world’s pains, but\nnoted how that intensity often leads to little more than frenzied self-\nabsorption. If instead of imagining how someone else is feeling (an\nother-oriented perspective), you are imagining how it would feel if this\nwere happening to you (a self-oriented perspective), “you” has just come\nto the forefront and the main point is that feeling someone’s pain feels\npainful.\nThe biological substrates of this are clear. Look at someone in pain\nwith the instruction to take a self-oriented perspective, and the amygdala,\nACC, and insular cortex activate, along with reports of distress and\nanxiety. Do the same with an other-oriented perspective, and all are less\nlikely. And the more extreme the former state, the more likely that\nsomeone’s focus will be to lessen their own distress, to metaphorically\nlook the other way.47\nThis can be predicted with remarkable ease. Expose subjects to\nevidence of someone else in pain. If their heart rate increases a lot (a\nperipheral indicator of anxious, amygdaloid arousal), they are unlikely to\nact prosocially in the situation. The prosocial ones are those whose heart\nrates decrease; they can hear the sound of someone else’s need instead of\nthe distressed pounding in their own chests.*48\nThus, if feeling your pain makes me feel awful, I’m likely to just\nlook out for number one, rather than helping you. Likewise if you’ve got\nyour own issues. We saw this earlier, with the demonstration that if you\nincrease people’s cognitive load, they become less prosocial toward\nMogil’s group (with my involvement) recently showed that if you use a\ndrug to block glucocorticoid secretion, both mice and humans become\nmore empathic toward strangers. Thus, if you feel highly distressed,\nwhether due to resonating with someone else’s problems or because of\nyour own, tending to your own needs readily becomes the priority.49\nIn other words, empathic states are most likely to produce\ncompassionate acts when we manage a detached distance. This brings to\nmind the anecdote from many chapters ago about the Buddhist monk I\nencountered who said that, yes, sometimes he cuts short his cross-legged\nmeditation because of his knees, but not because he feels them hurting\n—“I do it as an act of kindness to my knees.” And this is certainly in line\nwith the Buddhist approach to compassion, which views it as a simple,\ndetached, self-evident imperative rather than as requiring vicarious froth.\nYou act compassionately toward one individual because of a globalized\nsense of wishing good things for the world.*\nA handful of fascinating studies of Buddhist monks have been\ncarried out, both by Richard Davidson of the University of Wisconsin\nand Tania Singer of the Max Planck Institutes in Germany. Remarkably,\ngiven the science-versus-religion culture wars, such work was given its,\ner, blessing and facilitated by the Dalai Lama, who is famously intrigued\nby neuroscience and who has said that if his Dalai Lama gig hadn’t come\nup, he would have wanted to be a scientist or engineer. The most\npublicized work revolves around the neuroimaging of Matthieu Ricard, a\nFrench-born Buddhist monk (who is the Dalai Lama’s French translator\nand who just happens to have a PhD in molecular biology from the\nPasteur Institute—this is one interesting guy).50\nWhen confronted with examples of human suffering and instructed to\nempathically feel the pain of those people, Ricard showed activation of\nthe same circuitry as you’d see in most everyone else. And it was\nextremely aversive—“The empathic sharing very quickly became\nintolerable to me and I felt emotionally exhausted,” he explained. When\ninstead he did his Buddhist thing, focusing on thoughts of compassion, a\ntotally different picture of activation emerged—the amygdala was silent,\nand instead there was heavy activation of the mesolimbic dopamine\ntraining (focusing on a feeling of warmth and care toward that distressed\nperson).51 The former would generate the typical neuroimaging profiles,\nincluding heavy amygdala activation, and a negative, anxious state.\nThose with compassion training did not, showing heavy activation\ninstead in the (cognitive) dlPFC, coupling of activation between the\ndlPFC and dopaminergic regions, more positive emotions, and a greater\ntendency toward prosociality.\nOkay, caveats. This is a tiny literature (i.e., not much larger than the\nstudy of Ricard). And all-star Buddhist monks apparently meditate eight\nhours a day, not a trivial path to take. The point is merely to emphasize\nthis scenario of detachment. Which brings us to the next issue, which is\nwhether compassionate acts fostered by empathy are necessarily useful.\nDoing Something Effectively\nIn a provocatively titled 2014 article, “Against Empathy,” Paul\nBloom explored the ways in which empathy can lead to compassionate\nacts that are far from ideal.\nThere is the realm of what has been termed “pathological altruism,”\nthe type associated with codependency.52 This is the scenario of someone\nso consumed with the vicarious pain of a loved one that they endure and\nfacilitate his dysfunction rather than administering tough love. Then\nthere’s the danger that the empathic pain is so intense that you can only\ncome up with solutions that would work for you, rather than ones that\nmight help the sufferer. And there is the problem of empathy impeding\nyour doing what’s necessary—it’s not great if a parent is so vicariously\ndistressed by their child being distressed that they forgo vaccinations. A\nlarge piece of the training of health-care professionals is teaching them\nto keep empathy at bay.* For example, the various behavioral and\nneurobiological responses to seeing someone poked with a needle do not\noccur in acupuncturists. As Jamison describes, when anxiously seeing a\ndoctor about something worrisome, “I needed to look at him and see the\nopposite of my fear, not its echo.”\nreadily counts for more than suffering that is distant, involves a group,\nand is an alien form of pain.* Aroused empathy produces tunnel-\nvisioned compassion that can wind up misplaced. As the philosopher\nJesse Prinz emphasizes, the point is not whose pain pains us the most but\nwho most needs our help.\nAre There Ever Any Bloody Altruists?\nStop the presses; science has proven that it can feel good to do good,\ncomplete with activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. This\ndoesn’t even require a brain scanner. In a 2008 study in Science, subjects\nwere given either five dollars or twenty dollars; half were instructed to\nspend it that day on themselves, half on someone else (ranging from a\nfriend to a charity). And comparisons of self-assessments of happiness at\nthe beginning and end of the day showed that neither the larger amount\nof money nor the opportunity to spend it on oneself increased happiness;\nonly spending it on someone else did. And particularly interesting is that\nother subjects, told about the design, predicted the opposite—that\nhappiness would be raised most by spending on oneself, and that twenty\ndollars would buy more happiness than five.53\nThe question, of course, is why doing good can feel good, which\nraises the classic question: is there ever a selfless act that contains no\nelement of self-interest? Does doing good feel good because there’s\nsomething in it for you? I’m sure not going to tackle this from a\nphilosophical perspective. For biologists the most frequent stance is\nanchored in chapter 10’s evolutionary view of cooperation and altruism,\none that always contains some element of self-interest.\nIs this surprising? Pure selflessness is clearly going to be an uphill\nbattle if the very part of the brain most central to an empathic state—the\nACC—evolved to observe and learn from others’ pain for your own\nbenefit.54 The self-oriented rewards of acting compassionately are\nendless. There’s the interpersonal—leaving the beneficiary in your debt,\nthus turfing this from altruism to reciprocal altruism. There are the public\nmonitors human behavior and rewards or punishes accordingly; as we\nsaw in chapter 9, it is only when cultures get large enough that there are\nanonymous interactions among strangers that they tend to invent\nmoralizing gods. A recent study shows that across a worldwide range of\nreligions, the more people perceive their god(s) to monitor and punish,\nthe more prosocial they are in an anonymous interaction. Thus there is\nthe self-interested benefit of tipping the cosmic scale in your favor. And\nprobably most inaccessibly, there is the purely internal reward of\naltruism—the warm glow of having done good, the lessened sting of\nguilt, the increased sense of connection to others, the solidifying sense of\nbeing able to include goodness in your self-definition.\nScience has been able to catch the self-interest component of\nempathy in the act.55 As noted, some of the self-interest reflects concerns\nabout self-definition—personality profiles show that the more charitable\npeople are, the more they tend to define themselves by their charitability.\nWhich comes first? It’s impossible to tell, but highly charitable people\ntend to have been brought up by parents who were charitable and who\nemphasized charitable acts as a moral imperative (particularly in a\nreligious context).\n—\nHow about the self-interested reputational rewards of being altruistic, the\ncachet of conspicuous largesse rather than conspicuous consumption? As\nemphasized in chapter 10, people become more prosocial when\nreputation rides on it, and personality profiles also show that highly\ncharitable people tend to be particularly dependent on external approval.\nTwo of the studies just cited that showed dopaminergic activation when\npeople were being charitable came with a catch. Subjects were given\nmoney and, while in a brain scanner, decided whether to keep the money\nor donate. Being charitable activated dopamine “reward” systems—when\nthere was an observer present. When no one was present, dopamine\ntended to flow most when subjects kept the money for themselves.\nAs emphasized by the twelfth-century philosopher Moses\nMaimonides, the purest form of charity, the most stripped of self-interest,\nauction, seems most worthy of irony. In contrast, the motivation to think\nof yourself as a good person seems a pretty benign one. After all, we’re\nall searching for a sense of self, and better that particular sense than to\nassure yourself that you’re tough, scary, and not to be messed with.\nIs the element of self-interest ever truly absent? One 2007 study in\nScience examined this.56 Subjects (in brain scanners, of course) were\nunexpectedly given varying amounts of money. Then, some of the time\nthey were “taxed” (i.e., told that a certain percentage of that money\nwould be forcibly given to a food bank), some of the time given the\nopportunity to donate that amount voluntarily. In other words, the exact\nsame amount of public “good” was accomplished in each case, but the\nformer constituted enforced civic duty while the latter was a purely\ncharitable act. Thus, if someone’s altruism is purely other-oriented,\nwithout a smidgen of self-interest, the two circumstances are\npsychologically identical—those in need are being helped, and that’s all\nthat matters. And the more different the scenarios feel, the more self-\ninterest is coming into play.\nThe results were complex and interesting:\na. The more people’s dopaminergic reward systems activated\nwhen they unexpectedly received money, the less activation there\nwas when they were either taxed or asked to donate. In other\nwords, the greater the love of money, the more painfully it is\nparted with. No surprise there.\nb. The more dopaminergic activation there was when someone\nwas taxed, the more voluntarily charitable they were. Being\ntaxed could not have been welcome to the most self-interested—\nmoney was being taken from them. For subjects who instead\nshowed heavy activation of dopaminergic systems in that\ncircumstance, any self-interest of losing money was more than\ncompensated for by the knowledge that people in need were\nbeing helped. This taps into the last chapter’s exploration of\ninequity aversion and is consistent with findings that in some\nsurprise in the present study that subjects made happy by\nreducing inequity, even at a cost to themselves, were also the\nmost charitable. The authors appropriately interpret this as\nreflecting a compassionate act with elements independent of self-\ninterest.57\nc. There was more dopaminergic activation (and more self-\nreports of satisfaction) when people gave voluntarily than when\nthey were taxed. In other words, a component of the charitability\nwas about self-interest—it was more pleasing when those in\nneed were helped by voluntary efforts than when giving was\nforced.\nWhat does this show? That we’re reinforced by varying things and to\nvarying extents—getting money, knowing that the needy are being cared\nfor, feeling the warm glow of doing a good thing. And that it is rare to be\nable to get the second type of pleasure with no dependence on the third\nll things considered, it is a pretty remarkable thing that when an\nindividual is in pain, we (i.e., we humans, primates, mammals)\noften are induced to be in a state of pain also. There have been some\nmighty interesting twists and turns for that one to have evolved.\nBut at the end of the day, the crucial issue is whether an empathic\nstate actually produces a compassionate act, to avoid the trap of empathy\nbeing an end unto itself. The gap between the state and the act can be\nenormous, especially when the goal is for the act to be not only effective\nbut also pristine in its motives.\nFor someone reading this book, a first challenge in bridging that gap\nis that much of the world’s suffering is felt by distant masses\nexperiencing things that we haven’t an inkling of—diseases that don’t\ntouch us; poverty that precludes clean water, a place to live, the certainty\nof a next meal; oppression at the hands of political systems that we’ve\nbeen spared; strictures due to repressive cultural norms that might as\nwell be from another planet. And everything about us makes those the\nhardest scenarios for us to actually act—everything about our hominin\npast has honed us to be responsive to one face at a time, to a face that is\nlocal and familiar, to a source of pain that we ourselves have suffered.\nYes, best that our compassion be driven by the most need rather than by\nthe most readily shared pain. Nevertheless, there’s no reason why we\nshould expect ourselves to have particularly good intuitions when aiming\nto heal this far-flung, heterogeneous world. We probably need to be a bit\neasier on ourselves in this regard.\nLikewise, we should perhaps ease up a bit on the scratching-an-\naltruist problem. It has always struck me as a bit mean-spirited to\nconclude that it is a hypocrite who bleeds. Scratch an altruist and, most\nof the time, the individual with unpure motives who bleeds is merely the\nproduct of “altruism” and “reciprocity” being evolutionarily inseparable.\nBetter that our good acts be self-serving and self-aggrandizing than that\nFinally, there is the challenge of a compassionate act being left by the\nwayside when the empathic state is sufficiently real and vivid and awful.\nI’m not advocating that people become Buddhists in order to make the\nworld a better place. (Nor am I advocating that people don’t become\nBuddhists; what is the sound of one atheist waffling?) Most of us\ntypically require moments of piercing, frothing shared pain to even\nnotice those around us in need. Our intuitions run counter to doing it any\nother way—after all, just as one of the most frightening versions of\nhumans at their worst is “cold-blooded” killing, one of the most puzzling\nand even off-putting of us at our best is “cold-blooded” kindness. Yet, as\nwe’ve seen, a fair degree of detachment is just what is needed to actually\nact. Better that than our hearts racing in pained synchrony with the heart\nof someone suffering, if that cardiovascular activation mostly primes us\nto flee when it all becomes just too much to bear.\nWhich brings us to a final point. Yes, you don’t act because someone\nelse’s pain is so painful—that’s a scenario that begs you to flee instead.\nBut the detachment that should be aimed for doesn’t represent choosing\na “cognitive” approach to doing good over an “affective” one. The\ndetachment isn’t slowly, laboriously thinking your way to acting\ncompassionately as an ideal utilitarian solution—the danger here is the\nease with which you can instead think your way to conveniently\nconcluding this isn’t your problem to worry about. The key is neither a\ngood (limbic) heart nor a frontal cortex that can reason you to the point\nof action. Instead it’s the case of things that have long since become"

Which has given us aniconism, the banning of\nicons, and iconoclasts, who destroy offensive images on religious\ngrounds. Orthodox Judaism has been into that at times; ditto for\nCalvinists, especially when it came to those idolatrous Catholics.\nCurrently it’s branches of Sunni Islam that deploy literal graven-image\npolice and consider the height of offense to be images of Allah and\nMuhammad.\nIn September 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published\ncartoon images of Muhammad on its editorial page. It was a protest\nagainst Danish censorship and self-censorship about the subject, against\nIslam being a sacred cow in a Western democracy where other religions\nare readily criticized satirically. None of the cartoons suggested\nreverence or respect. Many explicitly linked Muhammad with terrorism\n(e.g., him wearing a bomb as a turban). Many were ironic about the ban\n—Muhammad as a stick figure with a turban, Muhammad (armed with a\nsword) with a blackened rectangle over his eyes, Muhammad in a police\nlineup alongside other bearded men with turbans.\nAnd as a direct result of the cartoons, Western embassies and\nconsulates were attacked, even burned, in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and\nLibya. Churches were burned in northern Nigeria. Protesters were killed\nIn July 2007 drawings by a Swedish artist of Muhammad’s head with\na dog’s body provoked much the same. In addition to deadly protests, the\nIslamic State of Iraq offered $100,000 for the artist’s killing, Al-Qaeda\ntargeted the artist for death (along with staffers from Jyllands-Posten),\nassassination plots were stopped by Western authorities, and one attempt\nkilled two bystanders.\nIn May 2015 two gunmen attacked an antianiconist event in Texas\nwhere a $10,000 prize was offered for the “best” depiction of\nMuhammad. One person was injured before the gunmen were killed by\npolice.\nAnd, of course, on January 7, 2015, two brothers, French-born sons\nn the Battle of Gettysburg fierce fighting occurred between the Union\nFirst Minnesota Volunteer Infantry and Confederate Twenty-eighth\nVirginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment.1 At one point Confederate soldier\nJohn Eakin, carrying the regimental flag of the Twenty-eighth Virginia,\nwas shot three times (a typical fate of soldiers carrying the colors, who\nwere preferential targets). Mortally wounded, Eakin handed the flag to a\ncomrade, who was promptly killed. The flag was then taken up and\ndisplayed by Colonel Robert Allen, who was soon killed, then by\nLieutenant John Lee, who was soon injured. A Union soldier, attempting\nn mid-2015 Tavin Price, a mentally challenged nineteen-year-old, was\nkilled by gangbangers in Los Angeles for wearing red shoes, a rival\ngang’s color. His dying words, in front of his mother, were “Mommy,\nplease. I don’t want to die. Mommy, please.”2\nIn October 1980 Irish Republican prisoners at the Maze Prison in\nNorthern Ireland began a hunger strike protesting, among other things,\ntheir being denied political-prisoner status by having to wear prison garb.\nThe British government acceded to their demands as a first prisoner\nslipped into a coma fifty-three days later. In a similar strike a year later\nin the Maze, ten Irish political prisoners starved themselves to death over\nforty-six to seventy-three days.\nBy 2010 karaoke clubs throughout the Philippines had removed the\nFrank Sinatra song “My Way” from their playlists because of violent\nresponses to the singing of it, including a dozen killings. Some of the\n“‘My Way’ killings” were due to poor renditions (which apparently often\nresults in killings), but most were thought linked to the macho lyrics. “‘I\ndid it my way’—it’s so arrogant. The lyrics evoke feelings of pride and\narrogance in the singer, as if you’re somebody when you’re really\nnobody. It covers up your failures. That’s why it leads to fights,”\nexplained the owner of a singing school in Manila to the New York\nTimes.\n—\nIn other words, people are willing to kill or be killed over a cartoon, a\nflag, a piece of clothing, a song. We have some explaining to do.\n—\nThroughout this book we’ve repeatedly gained insights into humans by\nexamining other species. Some of the time the similarities have been\nmost pertinent—dopamine is dopamine in a human or a mouse.\nBut some human behaviors stand alone, without precedent in another\nspecies. One of the most important realms of human uniqueness comes\ndown to one simple fact, namely that this is not a horse:\nAnatomically modern humans emerged around 200,000 years ago.\nBut behavioral modernity had to wait more than another 150,000 years,\nas evidenced by the appearance in the archaeological record of\ncomposite tools, ornamentation, ritualistic burial, and that stunning act of\nputting pigment on the wall of a cave.*3 This is not a horse. It’s a great\npicture of a horse.\nWhen René Magritte placed the words “Ceci n’est pas une pipe”\n(“This is not a pipe”) beneath a picture of a pipe, in his 1928 painting\nMagritte’s goal was to magnify and play with the distance between\nan object and its representation; these are coping mechanisms against\nthat modernist disquiet. But for that human putting pigment to wall in\nLascaux Cave more than seventeen thousand years ago, the point was the\nopposite: to minimize the distance between the two, to be as close as\npossible to possessing the real horse. As we say, to capture its likeness.\nTo gain its power, as imbued in a symbol.\nThe clearest human mastery of symbolism comes with our use of\nlanguage. Suppose you are being menaced by something and thus scream\nyour head off. Someone listening can’t tell if the blood-curdling “Aiiiii!”\nis in response to an approaching comet, suicide bomber, or Komodo\ndragon. It just means that things are majorly not right; the message is the\nmeaning. Most animal communication is about such present-tense\nemotionality.\nSymbolic language brought huge evolutionary advantages. This can\nbe seen even in the starts of symbolism of other species. When vervet\nmonkeys, for instance, spot a predator, they don’t generically scream.\nThey use distinct vocalizations, different “protowords,” where one\nLanguage pries apart a message from its meaning, and as our\nancestors improved at this separation, advantages accrued.5 We became\ncapable of representing past and future emotions, as well as messages\nunrelated to emotion. We evolved great expertise at separating message\nfrom reality, which, as we’ve seen, requires the frontal cortex to regulate\nthe nuances of face, body, and voice: lying. This capacity creates\ncomplexities that no one else—from slime mold to chimp—deals with in\nlife’s Prisoner’s Dilemmas.\nThe height of the symbolic features of language is our use of\nmetaphor. And this is not just flourish metaphors, when we declare that\nlife is a bowl of cherries. Metaphors are everywhere in language—we\nmay literally and physically be “in” a room, but we are only\nmetaphorically inside something when we are “in” a good mood, “in”\ncahoots with someone, “in” luck, a funk, a groove,* or love. We are only\nmetaphorically standing under something when we “understand” it.*6\nThe renowned cognitive linguist George Lakoff of UC Berkeley has\nexplored the ubiquity of metaphor in language in books such as\nMetaphors We Live By (with philosopher Mark Johnson), and Moral\nPolitics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think (where he demonstrates\nhow political power involves controlling metaphors—do you favor\n“choice” or “life”? are you “tough on” crime, or does your “heart\nbleed”? are you loyal to a “fatherland” or a “motherland”? and have you\ncaptured the flag of “family values” from your opponent?). For Lakoff\nlanguage is always a metaphor, transferring information from one\nindividual to another by putting thought into words, as if words were\nshopping bags.7\nSymbols, metaphors, analogies, parables, synecdoche, figures of\nspeech. We understand that a captain wants more than just hands when\nordering all of them on deck, that Kafka’s Metamorphosis isn’t really\nabout a cockroach, and that June doesn’t really bust out all over. If we\nare of a certain theological ilk, we see bread and wine intertwined with\nbody and blood. We learn that the orchestral sounds constituting the\n1812 Overture represent Napoleon getting his ass kicked when retreating\nkey point: these capacities evolved so recently that our brains are, if you\nwill, winging it and improvising on the fly when dealing with metaphor.\nAs a result, we are actually pretty lousy at distinguishing between the\nmetaphorical and literal, at remembering that “it’s only a figure of\nspeech”—with enormous consequences for our best and worst behaviors.\nWe start with examples of odd ways our brains handle metaphor, and\nonsider the following: You stub your toe. Pain receptors there send\nmessages to the spine and on up to the brain, where various regions\nkick into action. Some of these areas tell you about the location,\nintensity, and quality of the pain. Is it your left toe or right ear that hurts?\nWas your toe stubbed or crushed by a tractor-trailer? These various pain-\nometers, the meat and potatoes of pain processing, are found in every\nmammal.\nAs we first learned in chapter 2, the frontal cortical anterior cingulate\ncortex (ACC) also plays a role, assessing the meaning of the pain.8\nMaybe it’s bad news: your painful toe signals the start of some unlikely\ndisease. Or maybe it’s good news: you’re going to get your fire-walker\ndiploma because the hot coals only made your toes throb. As we saw in\nthe last chapter, the ACC is heavily involved in “error detection,” noting\ndiscrepancies between what is anticipated and what occurs. And pain\nfrom out of nowhere surely represents a discrepancy between the pain-\nfree setting that you anticipate versus a painful reality.\nBut the ACC does more than just tell you the meaning of a painful\ntoe. As we saw in chapter 6, put a subject in a brain scanner, make them\nthink they’re tossing a Cyberball back and forth with two other players,\nand then make them feel excluded—the other two stop throwing the ball\nto them. “Hey, how come they don’t want to play with me?” And the\nACC activates.\nIn other words, rejection hurts. “Well, yeah,” you might say. “But\nthat’s not like stubbing your toe.” But as far as those neurons in the ACC\nare concerned, social and literal pain are the same. And as proof of the\nrooting of the former in sociality, there isn’t ACC activation if the\nsubject believes the ball isn’t being thrown to them because of a glitch\nconnecting them to the other two subjects’ computers.\nAnd the ACC can take things a step further, as we saw in chapter 14.\nReceive a mild shock, and there’s activation of your ACC (along with\nMoreover, the brain intermixes literal and psychic pain.9 The\nneurotransmitter substance P plays a central role in communicating\npainful signals from pain receptors in skin, muscles, and joints up into\nthe brain. It’s got pain-ometer written all over it. And remarkably, its\nlevels are elevated in clinical depression, and drugs that block the actions\nof substance P can have marked antidepressant properties. Stubbed toe,\nstubbed psyche. Moreover, there is activation of the cortical parts of pain\nnetworks when we feel dread—anticipating an impending shock.\nFurthermore, the brain becomes literal when we do the flip side of\nempathy.10 It’s painful watching a hated competitor succeed, and we\nactivate the ACC at that time. Conversely, if he fails, we gloat, feel\nhis is our familiar domain of the insular cortex. If you bite into\nrancid food, the insula activates, just as in every other mammal.\nYou wrinkle your nose, raise your upper lip, narrow your eyes, all to\nprotect mouth, eyes, and nasal cavities. Your heart slows. You reflexively\nspit out the food, gag, perhaps even vomit. All to protect yourself from\ntoxins and infectious pathogens.11\nAs humans we do some fancier things: Think about rancid food, and\nthe insula activates. Look at faces showing disgust, or subjectively\nunattractive faces, and the same occurs. And most important, if you think\nabout a truly reprehensible act, the same occurs. The insula mediates\nvisceral responses to norm violations, and the more activation, the more\ncondemnation. And this is visceral, not just metaphorically visceral—for\nexample, when I heard about the Sandy Hook Elementary School\nmassacre, “feeling sick to my stomach” wasn’t a mere figure of speech.\nWhen I imagined the reality of the murder of twenty first-graders and the\nsix adults protecting them, I felt nauseous. The insula not only prompts\nthe stomach to purge itself of toxic food; it prompts the stomach to purge\nthe reality of a nightmarish event. The distance between the symbolic\nmessage and the meaning disappears.12\nThe linking of visceral and moral disgust is bidirectional. As shown\nin a number of studies, contemplating a morally disgusting act leaves\nmore than a metaphorical bad taste in your mouth—people eat less\nimmediately afterward, and a neutral-tasting beverage drunk afterward is\nrated as having a more negative taste (and, conversely, hearing about\nvirtuous moral acts made the drink taste better).13\nIn chapters 12 and 13 we saw the political implications of our brains\nintermixing visceral and moral disgust—social conservatives have a\nlower threshold for visceral disgust than do social progressives; the\n“wisdom of repugnance” school posits that being viscerally disgusted by\nsomething is a pretty good indicator that it is morally wrong; implicitly\nmoralizing about purity, while predicted by people’s propensity toward\nfeeling disgust, is not predicted by propensities toward fear or anger.*\nThe physiological core of gustatory disgust is to protect yourself\nagainst pathogens. The core of the intermixing of visceral and moral\ndisgust is a sense of threat as well. A socially conservative stance about,\nsay, gay marriage is not just that it is simply wrong in an abstract sense,\nor even “disgusting,” but that it constitutes a threat—to the sanctity of\nmarriage and family values. This element of threat is shown in a great\nstudy in which subjects either did or didn’t read an article about the\nhealth risks of airborne bacteria.15 All then read a history article that\nused imagery of America as a living organism, with statements like\n“Following the Civil War, the United States underwent a growth spurt.”\nThose who read about scary bacteria before thinking about the United\nStates as an organism were then more likely to express negative views\nabout immigration (without changing attitudes about an economic issue).\nMy guess is that people with a stereotypically conservative exclusionary\nstance about immigration rarely have the sense that they feel disgusted\nthat people elsewhere in the world would want to come to the United\nStates for better lives. Instead there is threat by the rabble, the unwashed\nmasses, to the nebulous entity that is the American way of life.\nHow cerebral is this intertwining of moral and visceral disgust? Does\nthe insula get involved in moral disgust only if it’s of a particularly\nvisceral nature—blood and guts, coprophagia, body parts? Paul Bloom\nsuggests this is the case. In contrast, Jonathan Haidt feels that even the\nmost cognitive forms of moral disgust (“He’s a chess grand master and\nhe shows off by beating that eight-year-old in three moves and reducing\nher to tears—that’s disgusting”) are heavily intertwined.16 In support of\nthat, something as unvisceral as getting a lousy offer in an economic\ngame activates the insula (a lousy offer from another human, rather than\na computer, that is); the more insula activation, the greater the likelihood\nof the offer being rejected. Amid this debate, it is clear that the\nintertwining of visceral and moral disgust is, at the least, greatest when\nthe latter taps into core disgust. To repeat a neat quote from Paul Rozin,\nintroduced in chapter 11, “Disgust serves as an ethnic or out-group\nuse of the word “neat” in the previous paragraph. Similarly, in Swahili\nthe word safi, meaning “clean” (from kusafisha, “to clean”), is used in\nthe same slangy metaphorical sense of “neat” in English. Once while in\nKenya, I was hitching a ride to Nairobi from somewhere out in the\nboondocks and got to chatting with a local teenager who was curious\nabout me. “Where are you going?” he asked. Nairobi. “Nairobi ni [is]\nsafi,” he said wistfully about the far-off metropolis. How are you going\nto keep them down on the farm once they’ve seen the neatness of\nNairobi?\nLiteral cleanliness and orderliness can release us from abstract\ncognitive and affective distress—just consider how, during moments\nwhere life seems to be spiraling out of control, it can be calming to\norganize your clothes, clean the living room, get the car washed.18 And\nconsider how the displaced need to impose cleanliness and order runs\nand ruins the lives of people suffering from the archetypal anxiety\ndisorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder. The ability of literal cleanliness\nto alter cognition was shown in one study. Subjects examined an array of\nmusic CDs, picked ten that they liked, and ranked them in order of\nliking; they were then offered a free copy of one of their midrange\nchoices (number five or six). Subjects were then distracted with some\nother task and then asked to rerank the ten CDs. And they showed a\ncommon psychological phenomenon, which was to now overvalue the\nCD they’d been given, ranking it higher on the list than before. Unless\nthey had just washed their hands (ostensibly to try a new brand of soap),\nin which case no reranking occurred. Clean hands, clean slate.\nBut beginning much further back than the “social hygiene”\nmovement of the turn of the twentieth century, being metaphorically\nneat, pure, and hygienic could be a moral state as well—cleanliness was\nnot just a good way to avoid uncontrolled diarrhea, dehydration, and\nserious electrolyte imbalance, but was also ideal for cozying up to a god.\nOne study was built around the phenomenon of visceral disgust\nmaking people harsher in their moral judgments. The authors first\nreplicated this effect, showing that watching a short film clip of\nWe intertwine physical and moral purity when it comes to our own\nactions. In one of my all-time favorite psychology studies, Chen-Bo\nZhong of the University of Toronto and Katie Liljenquist of\nNorthwestern University demonstrated that the brain has trouble\ndistinguishing between being a dirty scoundrel and being in need of a\nbath. Subjects were asked to recount either a moral or an immoral act in\ntheir past. Afterward, as a token of appreciation, the researchers offered\nthe volunteers a choice between the gift of a pencil and a package of\nantiseptic wipes. And the folks who had just wallowed in their ethical\nfailures were more likely to go for the wipes. Another study, showing the\nsame effect when people were instructed to lie, demonstrated that the\nmore adversely consequential the lie was presented as being, the more\nwashing subjects did. Lady Macbeth and Pontius Pilate weren’t the only\nones to at least try to absolve their sins by washing their hands, and this\nphenomenon of embodied cognition is referred to as the “Macbeth\neffect.”20\nThis effect is remarkably concrete. In another study subjects were\ninstructed to lie about something—with either their mouths (i.e., to tell a\nlie) or their hands (i.e., to write down a lie).21 Afterward, remarkably,\nliars were more likely to pick complementary cleansing products than\ncontrol subjects who communicated something truthful: the immoral\nmouth-ers were more likely to pick a mouthwash sample; the immoral\nscribes, hand soap. Furthermore, as shown with neuroimaging, when\ncontemplating mouthwash versus soap, those who had just spoken a lie\nactivated parts of the sensorimotor cortex related to the mouth (i.e., the\nsubjects were more aware of their mouths at the time); those who had\nwritten the lie activated the cortical regions mapping onto their hand.\nEmbodied cognition can be specific to parts of the body.\nAnother fascinating study showed the influence of culture in the\nMacbeth effect. The studies just cited were carried out with European or\nAmerican subjects. When the same is done with East Asian subjects, the\nurge afterward is to wash the face, rather than the hands. If you are going\nto save face, it should be a clean one.22\nFinally, most important, this intermixing of moral and physical\nhave the opportunity to clean their hands. Those who were able to wash\nwere less likely to respond to a subsequent (experimentally staged)\nrequest for help. In another study merely watching someone else wash\ntheir hands in this situation (versus watching them type) also decreased\nhelpfulness afterward (although to a lesser extent than the subject\nwashing).23\nMany of our moments of prosociality, of altruism and Good\nSamaritanism, are acts of restitution, attempts to counter our antisocial\nmoments. What these studies show is that if those metaphorically dirtied\nSENSATION\nhen there are ways in which we confuse literal with metaphorical\nsensation.\nA brilliant study by John Bargh of Yale concerned haptic sensations\n(I had to look the word up—haptic: related to the sense of touch).\nVolunteers evaluated the résumés of supposed job applicants; crucially,\nthe résumé was attached to a clipboard of one of two weights. When\nsubjects held the heavier clipboard, they tended to judge candidates as\nmore “serious” (while clipboard weight had no effect on other perceived\ntraits). When you next apply for a job, hope that your résumé will be\nattached to a heavy clipboard. How else would the evaluator figure out\nthat you can appreciate the gravity of a situation and deal with weighty\nmatters, rather than being a lightweight?24\nIn the next study subjects assembled a puzzle with pieces that were\neither smooth or rough as sandpaper, then observed a socially ambiguous\ninteraction. Handle the rough puzzle pieces and the interactions were\nrated as less coordinated, smooth, or successful (it’s not clear, however,\nif those subjects were more likely, at home that evening, to use coarse\nlanguage in describing their rough day).\nNext, subjects sat in either a hard or a soft chair (to quote the authors,\n“We primed subjects by the seat of their pants”). Sit in the former and\nthey were more likely to perceive individuals as stable and unemotional,\nto be less flexible in economic game play. This is remarkable—haptic\nsensations in your butt influencing whether you think someone is a hard-\nass. Or hard-hearted instead of a softie.\nSimilar intermixing of the real and the metaphorical occurs with\ntemperature sensation. In another study from Bargh’s group, the\nresearcher, hands full with something, would ask a subject to briefly hold\na cup of coffee for them. Half the subjects held warm coffee, half iced\ncoffee. Subjects then read about some individual and answered questions\nheart. And a more activated insula, as shown in a follow-up study.25\nOur brains also confuse metaphorical and literal interoceptive\ninformation. Recall that remarkable study showing that in a real-world\nsituation, a major predictor of whether a prisoner would be granted\nparole was how recently the judge had eaten. Empty stomach, harsher\njudgment. Other work has shown that when people are hungry, they\nbecome less generous with money and show more future discounting\n(i.e., are more likely to want reward X now, rather than wait for reward\n2X). Hungering for fame and fortune are just metaphors—yet our brain\npulls circuits related to real hunger into the mix. Moreover, we use more\nabstract levels of cognition when thinking about distant events. Ask\npeople to make a list of the items they’d bring on a camping trip taking\nplace either tomorrow or in a month; if the former, the list contains more\nspecific subcategories. In another study subjects were shown a graph of\nthe average amount of paper used by an office over time. There is a\nsteady increase until the most recent time period:26\nSubjects were then asked to predict what would happen in the next\ntime period. Half the subjects were told that the office was nearby.\nResult: those subjects did a microanalysis, preferentially paying attention\ntended to view the data points at a macro level of analysis, paying\nattention to the overall pattern and seeing that downturn as a mere\naberration:\nFar away\nWhat’s going on in these studies? Metaphors about weight, density,\ntexture, temperature, interoceptive sensations, time, and distance are just\nhe essence of a symbol is its ability to serve as a stand-in for the\nreal thing and, remarkably, we’re not the only species where a\nsignifier, independent of what it signifies, can gain a power of its own.\nAs discussed in chapter 2, if you condition a rat to associate a bell with a\nreward, about half of rats eventually come to find the bell itself\nrewarding.\nSo we’ve now examined cold drinks and cold personalities; lying\nthrough your teeth and then yearning for mouthwash; our hearts aching\nfor someone else’s pain. Our metaphorical symbols can gain a power all\ntheir own. But insofar as metaphors are the apogee of our capacity for\nsymbolic thought, it’s thoroughly weird that our top-of-the-line brains\ncan’t quite keep things straight and remember that those metaphors\naren’t literal. Why?\nThe answer harks back to a concept first introduced in chapter 10—\nevolution is a tinkerer, an improviser. So humans are evolving capacities\nfor abstractions like morality and deep violations of it, for experiencing\nempathy of unprecedented intensity, and for conscious assessment of the\naffiliative nature of someone’s temperament—moral disgust, feeling\nsomeone’s pain, warm and cold personalities. Given how short a time\nbehaviorally modern humans have existed, this has occurred in a blink of\nan eye. There hasn’t been enough time to evolve completely new brain\nregions and circuits for handling these novelties. Instead, tinkering\noccurred—“Hmm, extreme negative affect elicited by violations of\nshared behavioral norms. Let’s see . . . Who has any pertinent\nexperience? I know, the insula! It does extreme negative sensory stimuli\n—that’s, like, all that it does—so let’s expand its portfolio to include this\nmoral disgust business. That’ll work. Hand me a shoehorn and some duct\ntape.”\nThe key to evolution as an improviser rather than inventor is chapter\n10’s concept of exaptation—some trait evolves for some purpose and is\nThis isn’t to say it’s been an easy process, that magically one day\nneurons that help make you puke are suddenly involved in running the\npresident’s bioethics panel. It is insanely interesting to me that the most\nunique neurons in our brains, the recently evolved and slow-developing\nvon Economo neurons, are predominantly housed in the anterior\ncingulate and insula. And that the neurodegenerative disease\nfrontotemporal dementia, destined to eventually destroy the entire fancy\nneocortex, takes out von Economo neurons first—there’s something\nextra fancy (and thus expensive and vulnerable) about those cells. The\ntinkering and improvising was inspired.\nWhat’s most interesting is that we see the beginnings of the “I know,\nlet’s persuade the ACC and insula to volunteer for these new jobs” in\nother species. As we saw in chapter 14, the emotional contagion and\nprotoempathy that a rodent can feel for another one in pain is centered in\nthe anterior cingulate. And full-blown von Economo neurons are also\nfound in those same brain regions in the other apes, elephants, and\ncetaceans—evolution’s Mensa club—and exist in rudimentary forms in\nmonkeys. It’s unclear if, say, a blue whale wants to wash its flippers after\nur brains’ confusion of the metaphorical with the literal literally\nmatters. Back to chapter 10 and the evolutionary emphasis on kin\nselection. We saw the array of mechanisms used by various species for\nrecognizing kin and degree of relatedness—e.g., genetically shaped\npheromonal signatures and imprinting on the female whose birdsong you\nheard a lot while you were still inside an egg. And we saw that among\nother primates there are cognitive components as well (recall male\nbaboons’ degree of paternalism being predicted by their likelihood of\nbeing the father). By the time we get to humans, the process is mostly\ncognitive—we can think our way to deciding who is a relative, who is an\nUs. And thus, as we saw, we can be manipulated into thinking that some\nindividuals are more related to us, and others less so, than they actually\nare—pseudokinship and pseudospeciation. There are numerous ways to\nget someone to think that an Other is so different that they barely count\nas human. But as propagandists and ideologues have long known, if you\nwant to get someone to feel that an Other hardly counts as human, there’s\nonly one way to do it—engage the insula. And the surest way to do that\nis with metaphor.\nIn 1994 many Westerners became aware of the existence of the\nnation of Rwanda for the first time. The mountainous Central African\ncountry is tiny, with one of the highest population densities in the world.\nWay back when, it had been filled with hunter-gatherers who, as per\nusual, had been displaced over the last millennium by agriculturalists and\npastoralists, who came to form the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, respectively. It\nremains debated whether they arrived around the same century and\nwhether they were actually ethnically distinct groups, but the Hutu and\nTutsi Us/Them-ed with a vengeance. The minority Tutsi traditionally\ndominated the Hutu, reflecting the common herdsman/farmer power\ndynamics of Africa; German and Belgian colonials, in the classic divide\nand conquer, exploited and inflamed the tribal animosities further.\nWith independence in 1962 came a turning of tables and Hutu\nTutsis. Predictably, this increased anti-Tutsi militancy among Hutus and\nresulted in further discrimination and massacres. One of the ironies of\nwhat was to come, reflecting the uncertainty as to whether the Hutu and\nTutsi were historically even separate people, was that it wasn’t always\npossible to distinguish the two—identity cards were required to indicate\nethnicity.\nBy 1994 the Rwandan president, the dictator Juvénal Habyarimana, a\nHutu military man who had seized power in 1973, was under sufficient\npressure from Tutsi rebel groups that he signed a power-sharing peace\naccord with the rebels. This was viewed as a sellout by the growing\n“Hutu Power” extremist bloc. On April 6, 1994, Habyarimana’s plane\nwas shot down by a missile as it approached the capital, Kigali, killing\nall on board. It is still unclear whether the assassination was carried out\nby Tutsi rebels or Hutu Power elements in the military who were intent\non both eliminating Habyarimana and laying the blame on Tutsis. In any\ncase, within a day Hutu militants had killed essentially all moderate\nHutus in the government, seized power, officially laid blame for the\nassassination on Tutsis, and urged all Hutus to take revenge. And most\nHutus complied. Thus began what is now known as the Rwandan\ngenocide.*\nThe killing ran for approximately one hundred days (until it was\nfinally halted by Tutsi rebels gaining control). During that time, there\nwas not only a Final Solution–style attempt to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda\nbut also killing of Hutus who were married to Tutsis, who attempted to\nprotect Tutsis, or who refused to participate in killings. By the time it\nwas done, approximately 75 percent of Tutsis—between 800,000 and\n1,000,000 people—and around 100,000 Hutu had been killed. Roughly\none out of every seven Rwandans. This translated into five times the rate\nof killing during the Nazi Holocaust. It was mostly ignored by the\nWest.28\nFive times the rate. For those of us schooled in the modern Western\nworld’s atrocities, some translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide\ndid not involve tanks, airplanes dropping bombs, or shelling of civilians.\nThere were no concentration camps, no transport trains, no Zyklon B.\nwere dead, killed with machetes after being gang-raped and sexually\nmutilated, trapped in sanctuaries that were then burned to the ground. An\naverage of roughly ten thousand people per day. As perhaps the\ngenocide’s single most shocking atrocity, in the town of Nyange, the\nlocal Catholic priest, a Hutu named Athanase Seromba, gave sanctuary\nto between 1,500 and 2,000 Tutsi, many of them his parishioners, and\nthen led the Hutu militia that ultimately killed every person inside his\nchurch. Rivers ran red, not just metaphorically.*\nHow could this have happened? There are many components to the\nanswer. The populace had a long tradition of unquestioning obedience to\nauthority, a helpful trait to develop in a brutally dictatorial nation. Hutu\nmilitants had for months before been distributing machetes to the Hutu\npopulace. The government-controlled radio station (the main form of\nmass media in this marginally literate country) proclaimed that the intent\nof the invading Tutsi rebels was to kill every Hutu, and that one’s Tutsi\nneighbors were a fifth column preparing to join in. And there was\nanother meaningful factor. The anti-Tutsi propaganda was ceaselessly\ndehumanizing, with the infamous pseudospeciation of Tutsis being\nreferred to only as “cockroaches.” Stamp out the cockroaches. The\ncockroaches are planning to kill your children. The cockroaches [the\nsupposedly devious and seductive Tutsi women] will steal your\nhusbands.

Or\nsomething metaphorically like that. The tool of the propagandist is to\neffectively exploit symbols of revulsion in the service of hate. But the\nodd literal metaphoring of our brains can also provide the peacemaker\nwith a highly effective tool.\nIn a moving, important 2007 paper in Science, the American/French\nanthropologist Scott Atran, along with Robert Axelrod (of chapter 10’s\nPrisoner’s Dilemma fame) and Richard Davis, a conflict expert at\nArizona State University, considered the power of what they called\n“sacred values” in conflict resolution.29 These are straight out of\nGreene’s world of two different cultures of shepherds fighting over a\ncommons, each with a different moral vision as to what is correct, each\npassionately focused on “rights” whose meaning and power are\nincomprehensible to the other side. Sacred values are defended far out of\nproportion to their material or instrumental importance or likelihood of\nsuccess, because to any group such values define “who we are.” And\ntherefore, not only are attempts to reach compromises on such issues by\nusing material incentives unlikely to be productive, but they can be\ninsultingly counterproductive. You can’t buy us off into dishonoring that\nwhich we hold sacred.\nAtran and colleagues have studied the roles played by sacred values\nin the context of Middle East conflict. In a world of sheer rationality\nwhere the brain didn’t confuse reality with symbols, bringing peace to\nIsrael and Palestine would revolve solely around the concrete, practical,\nand specific—placement of borders, reparations for Palestinian land lost\nin 1948, water rights, the extent of militarization allowed to Palestinian\npolice, and so on. Solving those nuts-and-bolts issues may be a way of\nending war, but peace is not the mere absence of war, and making true\npeace requires acknowledging and respecting the sacred values of Them.\nAtran and colleagues found that, from the person in the street to the\nnot sufficient. “Let Israel apologize for our tragedy in 1948,” he added.\nAnd current Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in discussing\nwith them what was needed for true peace, cited not only instrumental\nissues of security but also how the Palestinians must “change their\ntextbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations.” As the authors state, “In\nrational-choice models of decision-making, something as intangible as\nan apology [or getting the likes of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion out\nof schoolbooks] could not stand in the way of peace.” Yet they do,\nbecause in recognizing the enemy’s sacred symbols, you are de facto\nrecognizing their humanity, their capacity for pride, unity, and\nconnection to their past and, probably most of all, their capacity for\nexperiencing pain.*\n“Symbolic concessions of no apparent material benefit may be key in\nhelping to solve seemingly intractable conflicts,” write the authors. In\n1994 the Kingdom of Jordan became the second Arab country to sign a\npeace treaty with Israel. It ended war, bringing to an end decades of\nhostilities. And it created a successful road map for the two nations to\nsaw evidence that something resembling a true peace was forming. It\nfollowed the creation of yet another martyr for peace, the assassination\nof Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, one of the architects of the Oslo\nPeace Accord, by a right-wing Israeli extremist. Extraordinarily, King\nHussein came to Rabin’s funeral and eulogized him, addressing his\nwidow in the front row:\nMy sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that\nthe moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of\na brother, a colleague and a friend.\nHussein’s presence and words were obviously irrelevant to any of the\nrational stumbling blocks to peace. And were immeasurably important.30\nA similar arc can be seen in Northern Ireland, where an IRA\nceasefire in 1994 facilitated an end to the violence of the Troubles and\nthe 1998 Good Friday Agreement laid the groundwork for Republicans\nand Unionists to coexist, for ex-Unionist demagogues and ex-IRA\ngunmen to serve in a government together. Much of the agreement was\nmaterial or instrumental, but there were elements of sacred values\naddressed—for example, the establishment of a Parades Commission to\nensure that neither group had inflammatory, symbol-laden parades in the\nother’s neighborhoods in Belfast. But in many ways the most palpable\nsign of a lasting peace came from an unexpected corner. The unity\ngovernment formed after the agreement was led by Peter Robinson as\nfirst minister and Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister. The\nformer had been a Unionist firebrand, the latter a leader of the political\nwing of the IRA; they were two men who epitomized the hatreds of the\nTroubles. They had a functional working relationship but nothing more\nthan that and had famously refused to ever actually shake hands\n(something that even Rabin and Yasir Arafat had managed). What finally\nbroke the ice? In 2010 Robinson was upended in a major scandal\ninvolving his politician wife, who had committed some major financial\nSomething similar happened in South Africa, much of it promulgated\nby Nelson Mandela, a genius at appreciating sacred values.32 Mandela,\nwhile at Robben Island, had taught himself the Afrikaans language and\nstudied Afrikaans culture—not just to literally understand what his\ncaptors were saying among themselves at the prison but to understand\nthe people and their mind-set. At one point just before the birth of a free\nSouth Africa, Mandela entered into secret negotiations with the\nAfrikaans leader General Constand Viljoen. The latter, chief of the\napartheid-era South African Defence Force and founder of the Afrikaner\nVolksfront group opposed to the dismantling of apartheid, commanded\nan Afrikaans militia of fifty to sixty thousand men. He was therefore in a\nposition to doom South Africa’s impending first free election and\nprobably trigger a civil war that would kill thousands.\nThey met in Mandela’s house, with the general apparently\nanticipating tense negotiations across a conference table. Instead the\nsmiling, cordial Mandela led him to the warm, homey living room, sat\nbeside him on a comfy couch designed to soften the hardest of asses, and\nspoke to the man in Afrikaans, including small talk about sports, leaping\nup now and then to get the two of them tea and snacks. While the general\ndid not quite wind up as Mandela’s soul mate, and it is impossible to\nassess the importance of any single thing that Mandela said or did,\nViljoen was stunned by Mandela’s use of Afrikaans and warm, chatty\nfamiliarity with Afrikaans culture. An act of true respect for sacred\nvalues. “Mandela wins over all who meet him,” he later said. And over\nthe course of the conversation, Mandela persuaded Viljoen to call off the\narmed insurrection and to instead run in the upcoming election as an\nopposition leader. When Mandela retired from his presidency in 1999,\nViljoen gave a short, halting speech in Parliament praising Mandela . . .\nin the latter’s native language, Xhosa.*\nThe successful birth of the new South Africa was rife with acts of\nrespect for sacred values. Perhaps the most famous was Mandela’s public\nembrace of rugby, a sport highly symbolic of Afrikaans culture and\nhistorically disdained by black South Africans. And famously, as\ndepicted in book and film, among the consequences was the tectonically\ncame before the South African host team’s mythic underdog winning of\nthe World Cup in 1995 in Johannesburg.\nI could watch that YouTube clip of the anthems being sung at the\nWorld Cup all day long, especially after having to write the section on\nRwanda.

    "content": "Biology, the Criminal\nJustice System, and (Oh,\nWhy Not?) Free Will*\nDON’T FORGET TO CHECK THEIR TEAR\nDUCTS\nome years back a foundation sent a letter to various people,\nsoliciting Big Ideas for a funding initiative of theirs. The letter said\nsomething along the lines of “Send us a provocative idea, something\nyou’d never propose to another foundation because they’d label you\ncrazy.”\nThat sounded fun. So I sent them a proposal titled “Should the\nCriminal Justice System Be Abolished?” I argued that the answer was\nyes, that neuroscience shows the system makes no sense and they should\nfund an initiative to accomplish that.\n“Ha-ha,” they said. “Well, we asked for it. That certainly caught our\nattention. That’s a great idea to focus on interactions between\nneuroscience and the law. Let’s do a conference.”\nSo I went to a conference with some neuroscientists and some legal\ntypes—law professors, judges, and criminologists. We learned one\nanother’s terminology, for example seeing how we neuroscientists and\nthe legal people use “possible,” “probable,” and “certainty” differently.\nWe discovered that most of the neuroscientists, including me, knew\nnothing about the workings of the legal world, and that most of the legal\nFun, stimulating, interdisciplinary hybrid vigor. And frustrating to\nme, because I kind of meant the title of the proposal that I had written.\nThe current criminal justice system needs to be abolished and replaced\nwith something that, while having some broad features in common with\nthe current system,* would have utterly different underpinnings. Which\nI’m going to try to convince you of. And that’s just the first part of this\nchapter.\n—\nYou can’t be less controversial than stating that the criminal justice\nsystem needs reform and that this should involve more science and less\npseudoscience in the courtroom. If nothing else, consider this: according\nto the Innocence Project, nearly 350 people, a mind-boggling 20 of them\non death row, imprisoned an average of fourteen years, have been\nexonerated by DNA fingerprinting.1\nDespite that, I’m going to mostly ignore criminal justice reform by\nscience. Here are some hot-button topics in that realm that I’m going to\nbypass entirely:\nWhat to do about the power and ubiquity of automatic,\nimplicit biases (leading to, for example, juries meting\nout harsher decisions to African American defendants\nwith darker skin). Should Implicit Association Tests be\nused in jury selection to eliminate people with strong,\npertinent biases?\nWhether neuroimaging information regarding a\ndefendant’s brain should be admissible in a courtroom.2\nThis has grown less contentious as neuroimaging has\ntransitioned from revolutionary to a standard approach\nin science’s tool kit. But there remains the issue of\nwhether juries should be shown actual neuroimages—\nthe worry is that nonexperts are readily overly impressed\nwith exciting, color-enhanced Pictures of the Brain (it’s\nturning out to be less of an issue than feared).\nsufficiently accurate. Nonetheless, there are\nentrepreneurs selling the approach (including, I kid you\nnot, a company called No Lie MRI). This issue extends\nto lower-tech but equally unreliable versions of is-that-\nbrain-lying? This includes electroencephalograms\n(EEGs), which are admissible in Indian courtrooms.3\nWhat should be the IQ cutoff for someone to be smart\nenough to be executed? The standard is an IQ of 70 or\nhigher, and debate concerns whether it should be an\naverage of 70 across multiple IQ tests, or if achieving\nthat magic number even once qualifies you for being\nexecuted. This issue pertains to about 20 percent of\npeople on death row.4\nWhat to do with the fact that scientific findings can\ngenerate new types of cognitive biases in jurors. For\nexample, the belief that schizophrenia is a biological\ndisorder makes jurors less likely to convict\nschizophrenics for their actions but more likely to view\nthem as more incurably dangerous.5\nThe legal system distinguishes between thoughts and\nactions; what to do as neuroscience increasingly reveals\nthe former. Are we approaching precrime detection,\npredicting who will commit a crime? In the words of one\nexpert, “We’re going to have to make a decision about\nthe skull as a privacy domain.”6\nAnd of course there’s that problem of judges judging\nmore harshly when their stomachs are gurgling.*7\n—\nAll of these are important issues, and I think reforms are needed at the\nintersection of progressive politics, civil liberties, and tough standards\nabout new science. In other words, a standard liberal agenda. Most of the\ntime I’m a clichéd card-carrying liberal; I even know the theme songs to\nIt’s the middle of the 1500s. Perhaps because of lax societal\nstandards and people being morally deprived and/or depraved, Europe is\noverrun with witches. It’s a huge problem—people fear going out at\nnight; polls show that peasants-in-the-street list “witches” as more of a\nthreat than “the plague” or “the Ottomans”; would-be despots gain\nsupporters by vowing to be tough on witches.\nFortunately, there are three legal standards for deciding if someone is\nguilty of witchcraft:8\nThe flotation test. Since witches reject the sacrament of\nbaptism, water will reject their body. Take the accused,\nbound, and toss them into some water. If they float,\nthey’re a witch. If they sink, they’re innocent. Quickly\nnow, retrieve innocent person.\nThe devil’s-spot test. The devil enters someone’s body\nto infect them with witch-ness, and that point of entry is\nleft insensitive to pain. Systematically do something\npainful to every spot on the accused’s body. If some spot\nis much less sensitive to pain than the rest, you’ve found\na devil’s spot and identified a witch.\nThe tear test. Tell the accused the story of the crucifixion\nof Our Lord. Anyone not moved to tears is a witch.\nThese well-established criteria allow authorities fighting this witch\nwave to identify and suitably punish thousands of witches.\nIn 1563 a Dutch physician named Johann Weyer published a book,\nDe Praestigiis Daemonum, advocating reform of the witch justice\nsystem. He, of course, acknowledged the malign existence of witches,\nthe need to punish them sternly, and the general appropriateness of\nwitch-fighting techniques like those three tests.\nHowever, Weyer aired an important caveat pertinent to older female\nwitches. Sometimes, he noted, elderly people, especially women, have\nhad atrophy of their lachrymal glands, making it impossible to cry tears.\n585\ntorching some poor elderly person simply because her tear ducts don’t\nwork anymore.”\nNow that’s a liberal reform of the witch justice system, imposing\nsome sound thinking in one tiny corner of an irrational edifice. Much\nlike what scientifically based reform of our current system does, which is\nwhy something more extreme is needed.*\n\net’s get down to cases. There are three ways of viewing the place of\nbiology in making sense of our behaviors, criminal or otherwise:\n1. We have complete free will in our behavior.\n2. We have none.\n3. Somewhere in between.\nIf people are forced to carefully follow the logical extensions of their\nviews, probably less than a thousandth of a percent would support the\nfirst proposition. Suppose someone convulsing with a grand mal\nepileptic seizure, flinging their arms around, strikes someone. If you\ntruly believe we freely control our behavior, you must convict them of\nassault.\nVirtually everyone considers that absurd. Yet that legal outcome\nwould have occurred half a millennium ago in much of Europe.9 That\nseems ludicrous because in the last few centuries the West has crossed a\nline and left it so far behind that a world on the other side is\nunimaginable. We embrace a concept that defines our progress—“It’s not\nhim. It’s his disease.” In other words, at times biology can overwhelm\nanything resembling free will. This woman didn’t bump into you\nmaliciously; she’s blind. This soldier standing in formation didn’t pass\nout because he doesn’t have what it takes; he’s diabetic and needs his\ninsulin. This woman isn’t heartless because she didn’t help the elderly\nperson who had fallen; she’s paralyzed from a spinal cord injury. Similar\nshifts in the perception of criminal responsibility have occurred in other\nrealms. For example, from two to seven centuries ago, prosecution of\nanimals, objects, and corpses thought to have intentionally harmed\nsomeone was commonplace. Some of these trials had a weirdly modern\ntint to them—in a 1457 trial of a pig and her piglets for eating a child,\nthe pig was convicted and executed, whereas the piglets were found to be\n587\nThus hardly anyone believes that we have complete conscious\ncontrol over our behavior, that biology never constrains us. We’ll ignore\nthis stance forever after.\n\nearly everyone believes in the third proposition, that we are\nsomewhere between complete and no free will, that this notion of\nfree will is compatible with the deterministic laws of the universe as\nembodied in biology. Only a subset of versions of this view fit the fairly\nnarrow philosophical stance called “compatibilism.” Instead this broader\nview is that we have something resembling a spirit, a soul, an essence\nthat embodies our free will, from which emanates behavioral intent; and\nthat this spirit coexists with biology that can sometimes constrain it. It’s\na kind of libertarian dualism (“libertarian” in the philosophical rather\nthan political sense), what Greene calls “mitigated free will.” It’s\nencapsulated in the idea that well-intentioned spirit, while willing, can be\nthwarted by flesh that is sufficiently weak.\n—\nLet’s start with the definitive legal framing of mitigated free will.\nIn 1842 a Scotsman named Daniel M’Naghten tried to assassinate\nBritish prime minister Robert Peel.10 He mistook Peel’s private secretary,\nEdward Drummond, for the prime minister and shot him at close range,\nkilling him. At his arraignment M’Naghten stated, “The Tories in my\nnative city have compelled me to do this. They follow and persecute me\nwherever I go, and have entirely destroyed my peace of mind. They\nfollowed me to France, into Scotland . . . wherever I go. I cannot get no\nrest from them night or day. I cannot sleep at night. . . . I believe they\nhave driven me into a consumption. I am sure I shall never be the man I\nformerly was. . . . They wish to murder me. It can be proved by\nevidence. . . . I was driven to desperation by persecution.”\nIn today’s terminology M’Naghten had some form of paranoid\npsychosis. It may not have been schizophrenia—his delusional\nsymptoms started many years later than the typical age of onset of the\ndisease. Regardless of the diagnosis, M’Naghten had abandoned his\nbusiness and spent the previous two years wandering Europe, hearing\ncommitting the act [i.e., murder].” M’Naghten was so clearly impaired\nthat the prosecution withdrew criminal charges, agreeing with the\ndefense that he was insane. The jury agreed, and M’Naghten spent the\nrest of his life in insane asylums, reasonably well treated by the\nstandards of the time.\nThere was bellowing protest after the jury’s decision, ranging from\nthe man in the street to Queen Victoria—M’Naghten had gotten away\nwith murder. The presiding judge was grilled by Parliament and stood by\nthe decision. The equivalent of the Supreme Court was tasked by\nParliament with assessing the case and supported him. And out of the\ndecision came the formalization of what is now the common criterion for\nfinding someone innocent by reason of insanity, namely the “M’Naghten\nrule”: if, at the time of the crime, the person is so “laboring under such a\ndefect of reason from disease of the mind,” that he cannot distinguish\nright from wrong.*\nThe M’Naghten rule was at the core of John Hinckley Jr. being found\nnot guilty for reasons of insanity in his attempted assassination of\nReagan in 1981, being hospitalized rather than jailed. There was\nconsiderable “He’s getting away with it” outrage afterward; a number of\nstates banned the M’Naghten criterion, and Congress essentially banned\nit for federal cases with the 1984 Insanity Defense Reform Act.*\nNonetheless, the reasoning behind M’Naghten has generally withstood\nthe test of time.\nThis is the essence of a stance of mitigated free will—people need to\nbe held responsible for their actions, but being floridly psychotic can be\na mitigating circumstance. It is the idea that there can be “diminished”\nresponsibility for our actions, that something can be semivoluntary.\nHere’s how I’ve always pictured mitigated free will:\nThere’s the brain—neurons, synapses, neurotransmitters, receptors,\nbrain-specific transcription factors, epigenetic effects, gene\ntranspositions during neurogenesis. Aspects of brain function can be\ninfluenced by someone’s prenatal environment, genes, and hormones,\nwhether their parents were authoritative or their culture egalitarian,\nhomunculus at a control panel. The homunculus is made of a mixture of\nnanochips, old vacuum tubes, crinkly ancient parchment, stalactites of\nyour mother’s admonishing voice, streaks of brimstone, rivets made out\nof gumption. In other words, not squishy biological brain yuck.\nAnd the homunculus sits there controlling behavior. There are some\nthings outside its purview—seizures blow the homunculus’s fuses,\nrequiring it to reboot the system and check for damaged files. Same with\nalcohol, Alzheimer’s disease, a severed spinal cord, hypoglycemic\nshock.\nThere are domains where the homunculus and that brain biology stuff\nhave worked out a détente—for example, biology is usually\nautomatically regulating your respiration, unless you must take a deep\nbreath before singing an aria, in which case the homunculus briefly\noverrides the automatic pilot.\nBut other than that, the homunculus makes decisions. Sure, it takes\ncareful note of all the inputs and information from the brain, checks your\nhormone levels, skims the neurobiology journals, takes it all under\nadvisement, and then, after reflecting and deliberating, decides what you\ndo. A homunculus in your brain, but not of it, operating independently of\nthe material rules of the universe that constitute modern science.\nThat’s what mitigated free will is about. I see incredibly smart people\nrecoil from this and attempt to argue against the extremity of this picture\nrather than accept its basic validity: “You’re setting up a straw\nhomunculus, suggesting that I think that other than the likes of seizures\nor brain injuries, we are making all our decisions freely. No, no, my free\nwill is much softer and lurks around the edges of biology, like when I\nfreely decide which socks to wear.” But the frequency or significance\nwith which free will exerts itself doesn’t matter. Even if 99.99 percent of\nyour actions are biologically determined (in the broadest sense of this\nbook), and it is only once a decade that you claim to have chosen out of\n“free will” to floss your teeth from left to right instead of the reverse,\nyou’ve tacitly invoked a homunculus operating outside the rules of\nscience.\nThis is how most people accommodate the supposed coexistence of\nAge, Maturity of Groups, Maturity of Individuals\nIn 2005’s Roper v. Simmons decision, the Supreme Court ruled that\nyou can’t execute someone for a crime committed before the age of\neighteen. The appropriate reasoning was straight out of chapters 6 and 7:\nthe brain, especially the frontal cortex, is not yet at adult levels of\nemotional regulation and impulse control. In other words, adolescents,\nwith their adolescent brains, aren’t as culpable as adults. The reasoning\nwas the same as why the pig was executed but not her piglets.\nIn the years since, there have been related rulings. In 2010’s Graham\nv. Florida and 2012’s Miller v. Alabama, the Court emphasized that\njuvenile offenders have the highest potential for reform (because of their\nstill-developing brains) and thus banned life sentences without parole for\nthem.\nThese decisions have prompted a number of debates:\nJust because adolescents are, on the average, less\nneurobiologically and behaviorally mature than adults\ndoesn’t rule out the possibility of some individual\nadolescents being as mature, thus being appropriately\nheld to adult standards of culpability. Related to that is\nthe obvious absurdity of implying that something\nneurobiologically magical happens on the morning of\nsomeone’s eighteenth birthday, endowing them with\nadult levels of self-control. The usual response to these\npoints is that, yes, these are true, but the law often relies\non group-level attributes with arbitrary age boundaries\n(e.g., the age at which someone can vote, drink, or\ndrive). There is this willingness because you can’t test\nevery teenager each year, month, hour, to determine\nwhether they are mature enough yet to, say, vote. But\nit’s worth doing so when it comes to a teenage murderer.\njuveniles are generally less culpable for their\nmisconduct than adults does not necessarily mean that a\n17-year-old murderer cannot be sufficiently culpable to\nmerit the death penalty” (her emphasis). Another\ndissenter, the late Antonin Scalia, wrote that it is “absurd\nto think that one must be mature enough to drive\ncarefully, to drink responsibly, or to vote intelligently, in\norder to be mature enough to understand that murdering\nanother human being is profoundly wrong.”11\nAmid these differing opinions everyone, including O’Connor and\nScalia, agrees that there exist age-related boundaries on free will—\neveryone’s homunculus was once too young to have its adult powers.12\nMaybe it wasn’t tall enough yet to reach all the control dials; maybe it\nwas distracted from its job by fretting about that gross pimple on its\nforehead. And that needs to be considered during legal judgments. Just\nas with piglets and pigs, it’s just an issue of when a homunculus is old\nenough.\nThe Nature and Magnitude of Brain Damage\nEssentially everyone working with a model of mitigated free will\naccepts that if there is enough brain damage, responsibility for a criminal\nact goes out the window. Even Stephen Morse of the University of\nPennsylvania, a strident critic of neuroscience in the courtroom (much\nmore later), concedes, “Suppose we could show that the higher\ndeliberative centers in the brain seem to be disabled in these cases. If\nthese are people who cannot control episodes of gross irrationality,\nwe’ve learned something that might be relevant to the legal ascription of\nresponsibility.”13 In this view, mitigating biological factors are relevant if\nthe capacity for reasoning has been grossly impaired.\nThus, if someone had their entire frontal cortex destroyed, you\nprobably shouldn’t hold them responsible for their actions, because their\npercentage of death row inmates have a history of damage to the frontal\ncortex, particularly of the most disabling type, namely early in life.\nIn other words, amid differing opinions about where a line should be\ndrawn, believers in mitigated free will agree that massive amounts of\nbrain damage overwhelm a homunculus, while it should be expected to\nhandle at least some damage.\nResponsibility at the Level of the Brain and at the\nSocial Level\nThe renowned neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga, one of the leading\nlights and elders of the field, has taken an extremely odd path in writing,\n“Free will is an illusion, but you’re still responsible for your actions.”\nThis is expounded at length in a challenging book of his, Who’s in\nCharge? Free Will and the Science of the Brain. Gazzaniga fully accepts\nthe entirely material nature of the brain but nonetheless sees room for\nresponsibility. “Responsibility exists at a different level of organization:\nthe social level, not in our determined brains.” I think either he is\nactually saying, “Free will is an illusion, but for practical reasons, we are\nstill going to hold you responsible for your actions,” or he is\nhypothesizing some manner of homunculus that exists only at a social\nlevel. In response to the latter idea, the pages of this book show how our\nsocial world is ultimately as much a product of our determined,\nmaterialist brains as are our simple motor movements.*15\nThe Time Course of Decision Making\nAnother well-established fault line in a stance of mitigated free will\nis that our capacity for free will moves to the forefront with decisions\nthat are slow and deliberative, whereas biological factors may push free\nwill aside in split-second-decision situations. In other words, the\nhomunculus is not always sitting right at the helm in the bunker; instead\nIssues of getting to the red button in time intersect with issues of the\nadolescent brain. A number of critics of Roper v. Simmons, starting with\nO’Connor in her dissenting opinion, noted a seeming contradiction. The\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) had filed an amicus curiae\nbrief in the case, emphasizing that adolescents (i.e., their brains) are so\nimmature that they can’t be held to adult criminal standards with\nsentencing. Turns out that the same APA had filed a brief some years\nearlier in a different case, emphasizing that adolescents are sufficiently\nmature that they should be able to choose whether to have an abortion,\neven without parental consent.\nWell, that’s a bit awkward, and it sure makes the APA and its ilk\nappear to be flip-flopping along ideological grounds, O’Connor charged.\nLaurence Steinberg, whose research on adolescent brain development\nwas covered heavily in chapter 7 (and whose work was influential in the\nRoper v. Simmons decision), offers a logical resolution.16 Deciding\nwhether to have an abortion involves logical reasoning about moral,\nsocial, and interpersonal issues, stretching out over days to weeks. In\ncontrast, deciding whether to, say, shoot someone can involve issues of\nimpulse control over the course of seconds. The frontal immaturity of the\nadolescent brain is more pertinent to split-second issues of impulse\ncontrol than to slow, deliberative reasoning processes. Or in a mitigated-\nfree-will framework, rapid-fire, impulsive behaviors can occur while the\nhomunculus has gone to the bathroom.\nCausation and Compulsion\nSome proponents of mitigated free will distinguish between the\nconcepts of “causation” and “compulsion.”17 In a way that feels a bit\nnebulous, the former involves every behavior having been caused by\nsomething, of course, but the latter reflects only a subset of behaviors\nbeing really, really caused by something, something that compromises\nrational, deliberative processes. In this view some behaviors are more\ndeterministically biological than others.\nsuggests that you mug someone, the law expects you to resist, even if it’s\nan imaginary friend in your head.\nBut others see distinctions depending on qualities of the auditory\nhallucinations. In that view, if a schizophrenic individual commits a\ncrime because a voice in his head demanded it, yes, his act was caused\nby that voice, but that doesn’t excuse the crime. In contrast, consider a\nschizophrenic individual committing a crime because thundering\nchoruses of taunting, threatening, cajoling voices in his head, complete\nwith baying hellhounds and choirs of trombones playing loud atonal\nmusic, command him every waking moment to do the crime. When he\nsuccumbs and does so, it is deemed more excusable, because those\nvoices constituted a compulsion to act.*\nThus in this view even a sensible homunculus can lose it and agree to\nvirtually anything, just to get the hellhounds and trombones to stop.\nStarting a Behavior Versus Halting It\nIt is virtually ordained that any discussion of volition and biology\neventually considers the “Libet experiment.”18 In the 1980s\nneuroscientist Benjamin Libet of UCSF reported something fascinating.\nA subject is hooked up to an EEG machine, which monitors patterns of\nelectrical excitation in the brain. She sits quietly, looking at a clock. She\nhas been instructed to flick her wrist whenever she feels like it and to\nnote the time, down to the second, when she decided to do so.\nLibet would identify something in the EEG data called a “readiness\npotential”—a signal from the motor cortex and supplementary premotor\nareas that a movement would soon be initiated. And consistently,\nreadiness potentials appeared about half a second before the reported\ntime of conscious intent to move. Interpretation: your brain “decided” to\nmove before you were even aware of it. Thus, how can you claim to have\nchosen when to move, evidence of free will, if the cascade of neural\nsignaling culminating in movement started before you consciously\nchose? Free will is an illusion.\nNaturally, this finding generated speculation, controversy,\nfive-hundred-millisecond delay, in that case? That’s the lag time between\nthe instant when the decision to move first occurs and when (a) attention\nis then focused on the clock and (b) the position of the second hand is\ninterpreted. In other words, the supposed half-second lag is an artifact of\nthe experimental design, not a real thing. Other criticisms concerned the\nambiguity of feeling that you intend to move. Other criticisms are more\narcane than I can follow.\nA very different interpretation of the finding was offered,\ninterestingly, by Libet. Yes, maybe your brain prepares to initiate a\nbehavior before there is conscious awareness of the decision, meaning\nthat your belief that you consciously chose to move is wrong. But in that\nlag time is the potential to consciously choose to veto that action. In the\npithy words of V. S. Ramachandran (of mirror neuron speculation in\nchapter 14), we may not have free will, but we have “free won’t.”19\nPredictably, this intriguing counterinterpretation has fueled more\ndiscussions, experiments, and counter-counterinterpretations. For us,\nsurveying different disputes concerning mitigated free will, this entire\ndebate is about the nature of a homunculus’s control panel. How many of\nits buttons and switches and dials that go up to eleven are involved in\ninitiating a behavior versus halting it?\n—\nThus a view of mitigated free will makes room for both biological\ncausation of behavior and free will, and all the discussions merely\nconcern where lines in the sand are drawn and how inviolate they are.\nThis prepares us to consider what I think is the most important line-\ndrawing debate.\n“You Must Be So Smart” Versus “You Must Have\nWorked So Hard”\nStanford psychologist Carol Dweck has done groundbreaking work\non the psychology of motivation. In the late 1990s she reported\nwork harder the next time, show more resilience, enjoy the process more,\nand become more likely to value the accomplishment for its own sake\n(rather than for the grade). Praise kids for being smart, and precisely the\nopposite occurs. When it becomes all about being smart, effort begins to\nseem suspect, beneath you—after all, if you’re really so smart, you\nshouldn’t have to work hard; you glide, you don’t sweat and grunt.20\nBeautiful work that has achieved cult status among many thoughtful\nparents of gifted kids, who want to understand when their child’s smarts\nshouldn’t come into the picture.\nWhy do “You’re so smart” and “You work so hard” have such\ndifferent effects? Because they fall on either side of one of the deepest\nlines drawn by believers in mitigated free will. It is the belief that one\nassigns aptitude and impulse to biology and effort and resisting impulse\nto free will.\nIt’s cool to see natural ability in action. The great all-around athlete\nwho has never seen pole-vaulting before, watches it once, tries it once,\nand soars like a pro. Or the singer whose voice has always had a natural\ntimbre that evokes emotions you never knew existed. Or that student in\nyour class who obviously just gets it, two seconds into your explaining\nsomething really abstruse.\nThat’s impressive. But then there’s inspiring. When I was a kid, I\nrepeatedly read a book about Wilma Rudolph. She was the fastest female\nrunner in the world in 1960, an Olympian who became a civil rights\npioneer. Definitely impressive. But consider that she was born\nprematurely, underweight, one of twenty-two kids in a poor Tennessee\nfamily, and—get this—at age four got polio, resulting in a leg brace and\na twisted foot. Polio, she was crippled by polio. And she defied every\nexpert’s expectations, worked and worked and worked through the pain,\nand became the fastest there was. That’s inspiring.\nIn many domains we can sort of grasp the materialist building blocks\nof natural ability. Someone has the optimal ratio of slow-twitch to fast-\ntwitch muscle fibers, producing a natural pole-vaulter. Or has vocal cords\nwith the perfect degree of velvety peach fuzz (I’m winging it here) to\nBut Rudolph-esque accomplishments seem different. You’re\nexhausted, demoralized, and it hurts like hell but you push on; you want\nto take an evening off, see a movie with a friend, but resume studying;\nthere’s that temptation, no one’s looking, everyone else does it, but you\nknow it’s wrong. It seems so hard, so improbable to think of those same\nneurotransmitters, receptors, or transcription factors when considering\nfeats of willpower. There seems a much easier answer—you’re seeing\nthe Calvinist work ethic of a homunculus sprinkled with the right kind of\nfairy dust.\nHere’s a great example of this dualism. Recall Jerry Sandusky, the\nPenn State football coach who was a horrific serial child molester. After\nhis conviction came an opinion piece on CNN. Writing under the\nprovocative heading of “Do pedophiles deserve sympathy?” James\nCantor of the University of Toronto reviewed the neurobiology of\npedophilia. For example, it runs in families in ways suggesting genes\nplay a role. Pedophiles have atypically high rates of brain injuries during\nchildhood. There’s evidence of endocrine abnormalities during fetal life.\nDoes this raise the possibility that a neurobiological die is cast, that some\npeople are destined to be this way? Precisely. Cantor concludes, “One\ncannot choose to not be a pedophile.”21\nBrave and correct. And then Cantor does a stunning mitigated-free-\nwill long jump. Does any of that biology lessen the condemnation and\npunishment that Sandusky deserved? No. “One cannot choose to not be a\npedophile, but one can choose to not be a child molester.”\nThis establishes a dichotomy of what things are supposedly made of:\nBiological stuff\nHomuncular grit\nDestructive sexual urges\nResisting acting upon them\nDelusionally hearing voices\nResisting their destructive commands\nProclivity toward alcoholism\nNot drinking\nHaving epileptic seizures\nNot driving if you didn’t take your meds\nNot all that bright\nGetting going when the going gets tough\nNot the loveliest of faces\nResisting getting that huge, hideous nose ring\nglucocorticoid levels; whether you’re in pain; if you have Parkinson’s\ndisease and which medication you’ve been prescribed; perinatal hypoxia;\nyour dopamine D4 receptor gene variant; if you have had a stroke in\nyour frontal cortex; if you suffered childhood abuse; how much of a\ncognitive load you’ve borne in the last few minutes; your MAO-A gene\nvariant; if you’re infected with a particular parasite; if you have the gene\nfor Huntington’s disease; lead levels in your tap water when you were a\nkid; if you live in an individualist or a collectivist culture; if you’re a\nheterosexual male and there’s an attractive woman around; if you’ve\nbeen smelling the sweat of someone who is frightened. On and on. Of all\nthe stances of mitigated free will, the one that assigns aptitude to biology\nand effort to free will, or impulse to biology and resisting it to free will,\nis the most permeating and destructive. “You must have worked so hard”\nis as much a property of the physical universe and the biology that\nemerged from it as is “You must be so smart.” And yes, being a child\nACTUALLY COME OF THIS?\ns I noted, the most formidable skeptic of the relevance of\nneuroscience to the legal system is Stephen Morse, who has\nwritten extensively and effectively about the subject.22 He is the\ndefinitive advocate of free will being compatible with a deterministic\nworld. He’s fine with M’Naghten and recognizes that there can be\nsufficient brain damage to compromise the notion of responsibility\n—“Various causes can produce genuine excusing conditions, such as\nlack of rational or control capacity.” But beyond those rare instances, he\nbelieves, neuroscience offers little that should challenge the notion of\nresponsibility. As he has quipped, “Brains don’t kill people. People kill\npeople.”\nMorse epitomizes the skepticism about bringing neuroscience into\nthe courtroom. For one thing, he viscerally cringes at how much of a fad\n“neurolaw” and “neurocriminology” have become. A wonderfully\nsardonic writer,* he has announced the discovery of the disorder “brain\noverclaim syndrome,” whose sufferers have gotten carried away with the\nimportance of neuroscience because they’ve been “infected and inflamed\nby stunning advances in our understanding of the brain,” causing them to\n“make moral and legal claims that the new neuroscience does not entail\nand cannot sustain.”\nOne absolutely valid criticism of his is a narrow, practical one. This\nis the worry, aired earlier, that juries will give undue weight to\nneuroimaging data just because of how impressive the images are.\nApropos of that, Morse has called neuroscience “determinism du jour,\ngrabbing the attention previously given to psychological or genetic\ndeterminism. . . . The only thing different about neuroscience is that we\nhave prettier pictures and it appears more scientific.”\nAnother valid criticism concerns findings in neuroscience usually\nmerely being descriptive (e.g., “Brain region A projects to brain region\nprocesses or states caused it; it simply redescribes it.”23\nThis is a point I’ve made throughout the book, namely that\ndescription and correlation are nice, but actual causal data are the gold\nstandard (e.g., “When you raise the levels of neurotransmitter X,\nbehavior Z happens more often”). That is the source of some of our most\npowerful demonstrations of the material bases of our more complex\nbehaviors—for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques\nthat transiently activate or inactivate a part of the cortex can change\nsomeone’s moral decision making, decisions about punishment, or levels\nof generosity and empathy. That’s causality.\nIt is when we get to the issue of causality that Morse distinguishes\nbetween causation and compulsion. He writes, “Causation is neither an\nexcuse per se nor the equivalent of compulsion, which is an excusing\ncondition.” Morse describes himself as a “thoroughgoing materialist”\nand states, “We live in a causal universe, which includes human action.”\nBut try as I might, I cannot see any way of making this distinction that\ndoes not tacitly require a homunculus that is outside the causal universe,\na homunculus that can be overwhelmed by “compulsion” but that can\nand should handle “causation.” In the words of philosopher Shaun\nNichols, “It seems like something has to give, either our commitment to\nfree will or our commitment to the idea that every event is completely\ncaused by the preceding events.”24\nDespite these criticisms of his criticisms, my stance has a major\nproblem, one that causes Morse to conclude that the contributions of\nneuroscience to the legal system “are modest at best and neuroscience\nposes no genuine, radical challenges to concepts of personhood,\nresponsibility, and competence.”25 The problem can be summarized in a\nhypothetical exchange:\nProsecutor: So, professor, you’ve told us about the extensive\ndamage that the defendant sustained to his frontal cortex when he\nwas a child. Has every person who has sustained such damage\nbecome a multiple murderer, like the defendant?\nNeuroscientist testifying for the defense: No.\nof damage produced murderous behavior in the defendant?\nNeuroscientist: No.\nThe problem is that, even amid all these biological insights that allow\nus to be snitty about those silly homunculi, we still can’t predict much\nabout behavior. Perhaps at the statistical level of groups, but not when it\ncomes to individuals.\nExplaining Lots and Predicting Little\nIf a person’s leg is fractured, how predictable is it that they will have\ntrouble walking? I think it would be safe to predict something close to\n100 percent. If they have serious inflammatory lung disease, how\npredictable is it that their breathing will be labored at times and that they\nwill tire easily? Again, around 100 percent. Same for the effects of\nsignificant blockage of blood flow to the legs or extensive cirrhosis of\nthe liver.\nLet’s switch to the brain and neurological dysfunction. What if\nsomeone has had a brain injury, and the neurons around the resulting scar\ntissue rewire so that they stimulate both themselves and one another—\nhow predictable is it that the person will have a seizure? How about if\nthey have congenital weaknesses in the walls of the blood vessels\nthroughout the brain—how likely is a cerebral aneurysm at some point?\nHow about if they have a mutation in the gene that causes Huntington’s\ndisease—how likely are they to have a neuromuscular disorder by age\nsixty? Really high in all cases; probably approaching 100 percent.\nLet’s incorporate behavior. If someone has extensive frontocortical\ndamage, how predictable is it that you’d note something odd about them,\nbehaviorally, after a five-minute conversation? Something like 75\npercent.\nNow let’s consider a broader range of behaviors. How predictable is\nit that this person with the frontal damage will do something horrifically\nviolent at some point? Or that someone who was abused repeatedly as a\nparticular array of glutamate receptor subtypes throughout their cortex\nand hippocampus will have an IQ above 140? That someone raised with\nextensive childhood adversity and loss will have a major depressive\ndisorder? All under 50 percent, often way under.\nSo how do a fractured leg inevitably impairing locomotion and the\nnoninevitabilities of the previous paragraph differ? Do the latter\nsomehow involve “less” biology? Is the point that the brain contains a\nnonbiological homunculus but that leg bones do not?\nHopefully, after this many pages, the start of an answer is apparent.\nIt’s not that there’s “less” biology in those circumstances related to social\nbehavior. It’s that it’s qualitatively different biology.\nWhen a bone shatters, there’s a relatively straight line of steps\nleading to inflammation and pain that will impair the person’s gait\n(should he try to walk an hour later). That straight line of biology won’t\nbe altered by conventional variation in his genome, his prenatal hormone\nexposure, the culture he was raised in, or when he ate lunch. But as\nwe’ve seen, all of those variables can influence social behaviors that\nshape our best and worst moments.\nThe biology of the behaviors that interest us is, in all cases,\nmultifactorial—that is the thesis of this book.\nLet’s see what “multifactorial” means in a practical sense. Consider\nsomeone with frequent depression who is visiting a friend today, pouring\nher heart out about her problems. How much could you have predicted\nthe global depression and today’s behavior by knowing about her\nbiology?\nSuppose “knowing about her biology” consisted only of knowing\nwhat version of the serotonin transporter gene she has. How much\npredictive power does that give you? As we saw in chapter 8, not much\n—say, 10 percent. What if “knowing about her biology” consists of\nknowing the status of that gene plus knowing if one of her parents died\nwhen she was a child? More, maybe 25 percent. How knowing her\nserotonin transporter gene status + childhood adversity status + whether\nshe is living alone in poverty? Maybe up to 40 percent. Add knowledge\nof the average level of glucocorticoids in her bloodstream today. Maybe\nwithdrawn rather than reaching out to someone). Some more\npredictability. Maybe even above the 50 percent mark by now. Add\nenough factors, many of which, possibly most of which, have not yet\nbeen discovered, and eventually your multifactorial biological\nknowledge will give you the same predictive power as in the fractured-\nbone scenario. Not different amounts of biological causation; different\ntypes of causation.\nThe artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky once defined free\nwill as “internal forces I do not understand.”26 People intuitively believe\nin free will, not just because we have this terrible human need for agency\nbut also because most people know next to nothing about those internal\nforces. And even the neuroscientist on the witness stand can’t accurately\npredict which individual with extensive frontal damage will become the\nserial murderer, because science as a whole still knows about only a\nhandful of those internal forces. Shattered bone → inflammation →\nconstricted movement is easy. Neurotransmitters + hormones +\nchildhood + ____ + ____ + isn’t.*27\nAnother factor comes into play. When I go to the Web of Science, a\nsearch engine for scanning databases of papers published in science and\nmedical journals. Under search terms I put in “oxytocin” and “trust”—\njust to pick an example of the umpteen links between biology and social\nbehavior that we’ve covered. And up comes the news that 193 papers\nhave been published on the subject. Consider the following figure,\nshowing that most of those papers have been published in the last few\nyears.\nSame with the next figure, a search for “oxytocin” and “social\n605\n\n606\nVisit bit.ly/2nyi5Ip for a larger version of these graphs.\nAnd just to give a sense of some more of these:\n\n607\nVisit bit.ly/2neYFVP for a larger version of this table.\nOur behaviors are constantly shaped by an array of subterranean\nforces. What these figures and the table show is that most of these forces\ninvolve biology that, not that long ago, we didn’t know existed.\nSo what do we do with Minsky’s definition of free will needing to be\namended to “internal forces I do not understand yet”?\n\nf you still think there is mitigated free will, there are three possible\nroutes to take at this juncture.\nTo appreciate the first, let’s briefly consider epilepsy. Scientists\nunderstand a lot about the neurological bases of seizures and how they\ninvolve firing with abnormally high frequency and synchrony. But not\nthat long ago, say, a century ago, epilepsy was viewed as a type of\nmental illness. And before that it was thought by many to be a\ncommunicable infectious disease. And at other times and places, it was\nthought to be caused by menstruation, or excessive sex, or excessive\nmasturbation. But in 1487 two German scholars uncovered a cause of\nepilepsy that really seemed to hit the nail on the head.\nThe two Dominican friars, Heinrich Kramer and Jakob Sprenger,\npublished Malleus Maleficarum (Latin for “Hammer of the Witches”),\nthe definitive treatise about why someone becomes a witch, how to\nidentify them, and what to do with them. What was one of the surest\nways to identify a witch? If they are seized by Satan, if they convulse\nfrom the malign power of the devil within them.\nTheir guideline was the Gospel according to Mark, 9:14–29. A man\nbrings his son to Jesus, saying there is something wrong with him and\nasking Jesus to cure him—a spirit comes and seizes him, making him\nmute, and then that spirit throws him to the ground, where he foams at\nthe mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. The man presents his\nson, who is promptly seized by that spirit and falls to the ground,\nconvulsing and foaming. Jesus perceives that the boy is infested with an\nunclean spirit and commands that vile spirit to come out and be gone.\nThe seizing ceases.\nThus seizures were a sign of demonic possession, a certain marker of\na witch. Malleus Maleficarum arrived in time to take advantage of mass\nproduction through the recently invented printing press. In the words of\nhistorian Jeffrey Russell, “The swift propagation of the witch hysteria by\nthe press was the first evidence that Gutenberg had not liberated man\nI don’t think much of Kramer and Sprenger. My assumption is that\nthey were sadistic monsters, but that could reflect my being influenced\ntoo much by the likes of The Name of the Rose or The Da Vinci Code.\nMaybe they were opportunists who reasoned that the book would make\ntheir careers. Maybe they were utterly sincere.\nInstead I imagine a scenario of an evening during the late fifteenth\ncentury. A church inquisitor comes home from work weary, burdened.\nHis wife coaxes him to talk—“It was a usual day of condemning\nwitches, but this one case bothered me. Everyone testified about this\nwoman who falls and gnashes and convulses—a witch, without a doubt.\nI don’t feel sorry for her—no one told her to open wide for Satan. But\nshe had these two beautiful kids—you should have seen them, just so\nconfused as to why their mother was being taken away. Distraught\nhusband also. So that part was hard, seeing them suffer. But it is what it\nis—we burned her, of course.” Burnings and killings and centuries were\nto pass until we in the West would have learned enough to say, “It’s not\nher; it’s her disease.”*\nWe’re only a first few baby steps into understanding any of this, so\nfew that it leaves huge, unexplained gaps that perfectly smart people fill\nin with a homunculus. Nevertheless, even the staunchest believers in free\nwill must admit that it is hemmed into tighter spaces than in the past. It’s\nless than two centuries since science first taught us that the frontal cortex\nhas something to do with appropriate behavior. Less than seventy years\nsince we learned that schizophrenia is a biochemical disorder. Perhaps\nfifty years since we learned that reading problems of a type that we now\ncall dyslexia aren’t due to laziness but instead involve microscopic\ncortical malformations. Twenty-five since we learned that epigenetics\nalters behavior. The influential philosopher Daniel Dennett has written\nabout the free will that is “worth wanting.” If there really is free will, it’s\ngetting consigned to domains too mundane to be worth the effort to want\n—do I want briefs or boxer shorts today?29\nRecall those charts and table showing the recentness of these\nscientific discoveries. If you believe that starting tonight, at midnight,\nsomething will happen and science will stop, that there will be no new\nwho undergoes such changes. In other words, the homunculus is alive\nand well.\nBut if you believe that there will be the accrual of any more\nknowledge, you’ve just committed to either the view that any evidence\nfor free will ultimately will be eliminated or the view that, at the very\nleast, the homunculus will be jammed into ever tinier places. And with\neither of those views, you’ve also agreed that something else is virtually\nguaranteed: that people in the future will look back at us as we do at\npurveyors of leeches and bloodletting and trepanation, as we look back at\nthe fifteenth-century experts who spent their days condemning witches,\nthat those people in the future will consider us and think, “My God, the\nthings they didn’t know then. The harm that they did.”\nArchaeologists do something impressive, reflecting disciplinary\nhumility. When archaeologists excavate a site, they recognize that future\narchaeologists will be horrified at their primitive techniques, at the\ndestructiveness of their excavating. Thus they often leave most of a site\nuntouched to await their more skillful disciplinary descendants. For\nexample, astonishingly, more than forty years after excavations began,\nless than 1 percent of the famed Qin dynasty terra-cotta army in China\nhas been uncovered.\nThose adjudicating trials don’t have the luxury of adjourning for a\ncentury until we really understand the biology of behavior. But at the\nvery least the system needs the humility of archaeology, a sense that,\nabove all else, we shouldn’t act irrevocably.\nBut what do we actually do in the meantime? Simple (which is easy\nfor me to say, looking at the legal world from the soothing distance of\nmy laboratory): probably just three things. One is easy, one is very\nchallenging to implement, and the third is nearly impossible.\nFirst the easy one. If you reject free will and the discussion turns to\nthe legal system, the crazy-making, inane challenge that always surfaces\nis that you’d do nothing about criminals, that they’d be free to walk the\nstreets, wreaking havoc. Let’s trash this one instantly—no rational\nperson who rejects free will actually believes this, would argue that we\nshould do nothing because, after all, the person has frontal damage, or\nfaulty to be driven. Rehabilitate such people if you can, send them to the\nIsland of Misfit Toys forever if you can’t and they are destined to remain\ndangerous. Josh Greene and Jonathan Cohen of Princeton wrote an\nextremely clearheaded piece on this, “For the Law, Neuroscience\nChanges Nothing and Everything.” Where neuroscience and the rest of\nbiology change nothing is in the continued need to protect the\nendangered from the dangerous.30\nNow for the nearly impossible issue, the one that “changes\neverything”—the issue of punishment. Maybe, just maybe, a criminal\nmust suffer punishment at junctures in a behaviorist framework, as part\nof rehabilitation, part of making recidivism unlikely by fostering\nexpanded frontal capacity. It is implicit in the very process of denying a\ndangerous individual their freedom by removing them from society. But\nprecluding free will precludes punishment being an end in and of itself,\npunishment being imagined to “balance” the scales of justice.\nIt is the punisher’s mind-set where everything must be changed. The\ndifficulty of this is explored in the superb book The Punisher’s Brain:\nThe Evolution of Judge and Jury (2014) by Morris Hoffman, a practicing\njudge and legal scholar.31 He reviews the reasons for punishment: As we\nsee from game theory studies, because punishment fosters cooperation.\nBecause it is in the fabric of the evolution of sociality. And most\nimportant, because it can feel good to punish, to be part of a righteous\nand self-righteous crowd at a public hanging, knowing that justice is\nbeing served.\nThis is a deep, atavistic pleasure. Put people in brain scanners, give\nthem scenarios of norm violations. Decision making about culpability for\nthe violation correlates with activity in the cognitive dlPFC. But decision\nmaking about appropriate punishment activates the emotional vmPFC,\nalong with the amygdala and insula; the more activation, the more\npunishment.32 The decision to punish, the passionate motivation to do\nso, is a frothy limbic state. As are the consequences of punishing—when\nsubjects punish someone for making a lousy offer in an economic game,\nthere’s activation of dopaminergic reward systems. Punishment that feels\njust feels good.\nto our tax dollars paying for the dental plan of the prison guard who\noperates the lethal injection machine. That rush of self-righteous pleasure\nis what drives us to shoulder the costs. This was shown in one\nneuroimaging study of economic game play. Subjects alternated between\nbeing able to punish lousy offers at no cost and having to spend points\nthey had earned to do so. And the more dopaminergic activation during\nno-cost punishment, the more someone would pay to punish in the other\ncondition.33\nThus the nearly impossible task is to overcome that. Sure, as I said,\npunishment would still be used in an instrumental fashion, to acutely\nshape behavior. But there is simply no place for the idea that punishment\nis a virtue. Our dopaminergic pathways will have to find their\nstimulation elsewhere. I sure don’t know how best to achieve that mind-\nset. But crucially, I sure do know we can do it—because we have before:\nOnce people with epilepsy were virtuously punished for their intimacy\nwith Lucifer. Now we mandate that if their seizures aren’t under control,\nthey can’t drive. And the key point is that no one views such a driving\nban as virtuous, pleasurable punishment, believing that a person with\ntreatment-resistant seizures “deserves” to be banned from driving.\nCrowds of goitrous yahoos don’t excitedly mass to watch the epileptic’s\ndriver’s license be publicly burned. We’ve successfully banished the\nnotion of punishment in that realm. It may take centuries, but we can do\nthe same in all our current arenas of punishment.\nWhich brings us to the huge practical challenge. The traditional\nrationales behind imprisonment are to protect the public, to rehabilitate,\nto punish, and finally to use the threat of punishment to deter others.\nThat last one is the practical challenge, because such threats of\npunishment can indeed deter. How can that be done? The broadest type\nof solution is incompatible with an open society—making the public\nbelieve that imprisonment involves horrific punishments when, in reality,\nit doesn’t. Perhaps the loss of freedom that occurs when a dangerous\nperson is removed from society must be deterrence enough. Perhaps\nsome conventional punishment will still be needed if it is sufficiently\npeople who were prosecuting epileptics in the fifteenth century were no\ndifferent from us—sincere, cautious, and ethical, concerned about the\nserious problems threatening their society, hoping to bequeath their\nchildren a safer world. Just operating with an unrecognizably different\nmind-set. The psychological distance from them to us is vast, separated\nby the yawning chasm that was the discovery of “It’s not her, it’s her\ndisease.” Having crossed that divide, the distance we now need to go is\nfar shorter—it merely consists of taking that same insight and being\nwilling to see its valid extension in whatever directions science takes us.\nThe hope is that when it comes to dealing with humans whose\nbehaviors are among our worst and most damaging, words like “evil”\nand “soul” will be as irrelevant as when considering a car with faulty\nbrakes, that they will be as rarely spoken in a courtroom as in an auto\nrepair shop. And crucially, the analogy holds in a key way, extending to\ninstances of dangerous people without anything obviously wrong with\ntheir frontal cortex, genes, and so on. When a car is being dysfunctional\nand dangerous and we take it to a mechanic, this is not a dualistic\nsituation where (a) if the mechanic discovers some broken widget\ncausing the problem, we have a mechanistic explanation, but (b) if the\nmechanic can’t find anything wrong, we’re dealing with an evil car; sure,\nthe mechanic can speculate on the source of the problem—maybe it’s the\nblueprint from which the car was built, maybe it was the building\nprocess, maybe the environment contains some unknown pollutant that\nsomehow impairs function, maybe someday we’ll have sufficiently\npowerful techniques in the auto shop to spot some key molecule in the\nengine that is out of whack—but in the meantime we’ll consider this car\nto be evil. Car free will also equals “internal forces we do not understand\nyet.”*34\nMany who are viscerally opposed to this view charge that it is\ndehumanizing to frame damaged humans as broken machines. But as a\nPART\nell, so much for the criminal justice system. Now on to the really\ndifficult part, which is what to do when someone compliments\nyour zygomatic arches.\nIf we deny free will when it comes to the worst of our behaviors, the\nsame must also apply to the best. To our talents, displays of willpower\nand focus, moments of bursting creativity, decency, and compassion.\nLogically it should seem as ludicrous to take credit for those traits as to\nrespond to a compliment on the beauty of your cheekbones by thanking\nthe person for implicitly having praised your free will, instead of\nexplaining how mechanical forces acted upon the zygomatic arches of\nyour skull.\nIt will be so difficult to act that way. I am willing to admit that I have\nacted egregiously in this regard. My wife and I have brunch with a\nfriend, who serves fruit salad. We proclaim, “Wow, the pineapple is\ndelicious.” “They’re out of season,” our host smugly responds, “but I\nlucked out and found a decent one.” My wife and I express awestruck\nworship—“You really know how to pick fruit. You are a better person\nthan we are.” We are praising the host for this supposed display of free\nwill, for the choice made at the fork in life’s road that is pineapple\nchoosing. But we’re wrong. In reality, genes had something to do with\nthe olfactory receptors our host has that help detect ripeness. Maybe our\nhost comes from a people whose deep and ancient cultural values include\nlearning how to feel up a pineapple to tell if it’s good. The sheer luck of\nthe socioeconomic trajectory of our host’s life has provided the resources\nto prowl an overpriced organic market playing Peruvian folk Muzak. Yet\nwe praise our host.\nI can’t really imagine how to live your life as if there is no free will.\nIt may never be possible to view ourselves as the sum of our biology.\nPerhaps we’ll have to settle for making sure our homuncular myths are"

Yet the rationale for this book\nis that, nonetheless, there’s ground for optimism.\nThus this final chapter’s goals are (a) to evidence that things have\nimproved, that many of our worst behaviors are in retreat, our best ones\nascendant; (b) to examine ways to improve this further; (c) to derive\nemotional support for this venture, to see that our best behaviors can\nhen it comes to our best and worst behaviors, the world is\nastonishingly different from that of the not-so-distant past. At the\ndawn of the nineteenth century, slavery occurred worldwide, including in\nthe colonies of a Europe basking in the Enlightenment. Child labor was\nuniversal and would soon reach its exploitative golden age with the\nIndustrial Revolution. And there wasn’t a country that punished\nmistreatment of animals. Now every nation has outlawed slavery, and\nmost attempt to enforce that; most have child labor laws, rates of child\nlabor have declined, and it increasingly consists of children working\nalongside their parents in their homes; most countries regulate the\ntreatment of animals in some manner.\nThe world is also safer. Fifteenth-century Europe averaged 41\nhomicides per 100,000 people per year. Currently only El Salvador,\nVenezuela, and Honduras, at 62, 64, and 85, respectively, are worse; the\nworld averages 6.9, Europe averages 1.4, and there are Iceland, Japan,\nand Singapore at 0.3.\nHere are things that are rarer in recent centuries: Forced marriages,\nchild brides, genital mutilation, wife beating, polygamy, widow burning.\nPersecution of homosexuals, epileptics, albinos. Beating of\nschoolchildren, beating of beasts of burden. Rule of a land by an\noccupying army, by a colonial overlord, by an unelected dictator.\nIlliteracy, death in infancy, death in childbirth, death from preventable\ndisease. Capital punishment.\nHere are things invented in the last century: Bans on the use of\ncertain types of weapons. The World Court and the concept of crimes\nagainst humanity. The UN and the dispatching of multinational\npeacekeeping forces. International agreements to hinder trafficking of\nblood diamonds, elephant tusks, rhino horns, leopard skins, and humans.\nAgencies that collect money to aid disaster victims anywhere on the\nplanet, that facilitate intercontinental adoption of orphans, that battle\nglobal pandemics and send medical personnel to any place of conflict.\nlittle has changed in many places; I have spent decades in Africa living\naround people who believe that epileptics are possessed and that the\norgans of murdered albinos have healing powers, where beating of\nwives, children, and animals is the norm, five-year-olds herd cattle and\nhaul firewood, pubescent girls are clitoridectomized and given to old\nmen as third wives. Nonetheless, worldwide, things have improved.\nThe definitive account of this is Pinker’s monumental The Better\nAngels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.2 It’s a scholarly\nwork that’s gut-wrenchingly effective in documenting just how bad\nthings once were. Pinker graphically describes the appalling historical\ninhumanity of humans. Roughly half a million people died in the Roman\nColosseum to supply audiences of tens of thousands the pleasure of\nwatching captives raped, dismembered, tortured, eaten by animals.\nThroughout the Middle Ages, armies swept across Eurasia, destroying\nvillages, killing every man, consigning every woman and child to\nslavery. Aristocracy accounted for a disproportionate share of violence,\nsavaging peasantry with impunity. Religious and governmental\nauthorities, ranging from Europeans to Persians, Chinese, Hindus,\nPolynesians, Aztecs, Africans, and Native Americans, invented means of\ntorture. For a bored sixteenth-century Parisian, entertainment might\nconsist of a cat burning, execution of a “criminal” animal, or bearbaiting,\nwhere a bear, chained to a post, would be torn apart by dogs. It is a\nsickeningly different world; Pinker quotes the writer L. P. Hartley: “The\npast is a foreign country: they do things differently there.”\nBetter Angels has provoked three controversies:\nWhy Were People So Awful Then?\nFor Pinker the answer is clear. Because people had always been so\nawful. This is chapter 9’s debate—when was war invented, was ancestral\nhunter-gatherer life about Hobbes or Rousseau? As we saw, Pinker is in\nthe camp holding that organized human violence predates civilization,\nstretching back to our last common ancestor with chimps. And as\nWhy Have People Gotten Less Awful?\nPinker’s answer reflects two factors. He draws on the sociologist\nNorbert Elias, whose notion of the “civilizing process” centered on the\nfact that violence declines when states monopolize force. That is coupled\nwith spread of commerce and trade, fostering realpolitik self-restraint—\nrecognizing that it’s better to have this other person alive and trading\nwith you. Their well-being begins to matter, prompting what Pinker calls\nan “escalator of reasoning”—an enlarged capacity for empathy and Us-\nness. This underlies the “rights revolution”—civil rights, women’s rights,\nchildren’s rights, gay rights, animal rights. This view is a triumph of\ncognition. Pinker yokes this to the “Flynn effect,” the well-documented\nincrease in average IQ over the last century; he invokes a moral Flynn\neffect, as increasing intelligence and respect for reasoning fuel better\nTheory of Mind and perspective taking and an increased ability to\nappreciate the long-term advantages of peace. In the words of one\nreviewer, Pinker is “not too fainthearted to call his own culture\ncivilized.”3\nPredictably, this has drawn fire from all sides. The Left charges that\nthis giddy overvaluing of the dead-white-male Enlightenment fuels\nWestern neoimperialism.4 My personal political instincts run in this\ndirection. Nonetheless, one must admit that the countries with minimal\nviolence, extensive social safety nets, few child brides, numerous female\nlegislators, and sacrosanct civil liberties are usually direct cultural\ndescendants of the Enlightenment.\nMeanwhile, the Right claims that Pinker ignores religion, pretending\nthat decency was invented in the Enlightenment.5 He is eloquently\nunapologetic about this—for him much of what has gone right reflects\npeople’s “shifting from valuing souls to valuing lives.” For others the\ncriticism is that this escalator of reasoning fetishizes cognition over\naffect—after all, sociopaths have great Theory of Mind, a (damage-\nHave People Really Gotten Less Awful?\nThis has been very contentious. Pinker offers the sound bite “We\nmay be living in the most peaceful era in our species’ existence.” The\nfact most driving this optimism is that, except for the Balkan wars,\nEurope has been at peace since 1945, the longest stretch in history. For\nPinker, this “Long Peace” represents the West coming to its senses after\nthe ruin of World War II, seeing how the advantages of being a common\nmarket outweigh those of being a perpetually warring continent, plus\nsome expanding empathy thrown in on the side.\nCritics characterize this as Eurocentrism. Western countries may\nkumbaya one another, but they’ve sure made war elsewhere—France in\nIndochina and Algeria, Britain in Malaya and Kenya, Portugal in Angola\nand Mozambique, the USSR in Afghanistan, the United States in\nVietnam, Korea, and Latin America. Moreover, parts of the developing\nworld have been continuously at war for decades—consider the eastern\nCongo. Most important, such wars have been made bloodier because the\nWest invented the idea of having client states fight proxy wars for them.\nAfter all, the late twentieth century saw the United States and USSR arm\nthe warring Somalia and Ethiopia, only to switch to arming the other\nside within a few years. The Long Peace has been for Westerners.\nThe claim of violence declining steadily over the last millennium\nalso must accommodate the entire bloody twentieth century. World War\nII killed 55 million people, more than any conflict in history. Throw in\nWorld War I, Stalin, Mao, and the Russian and Chinese civil wars, and\nyou’re up to 130 million.\nPinker does something sensible that reflects his being a scientist. He\ncorrects for total population size. Thus, while the eighth century’s An\nLushan Rebellion and civil war in Tang dynasty China killed “only” 36\nmillion, that represented one sixth of the world’s population—the\nequivalent of 429 million in the midtwentieth century. When deaths are\nexpressed as a percentage of total population, World War II is the only\nCritics have questioned this—“Hey, stop using fudge factors to\nsomehow make World War II’s 55 million dead less than the fall of\nRome’s 8 million.” After all, 9/11’s murders would not have evoked only\nhalf as much terror if America had 600 million instead of 300 million\ncitizens. But Pinker’s analysis is appropriate, and analyzing rates of\nevents is how you discover that today’s London is much safer than was\nDickens’s or that some hunter-gatherer groups have homicide rates that\nmatch Detroit’s.\nBut Pinker failed to take things one logical step further—also\ncorrecting for differing durations of events. Thus he compares the half\ndozen years of World War II with, for example, twelve centuries of the\nMideast slave trade and four centuries of Native American genocide.\nWhen corrected for duration as well as total world population, the top ten\nnow include World War II (number one), World War I (number three),\nthe Russian Civil War (number eight), Mao (number ten), and an event\nthat didn’t even make Pinker’s original list, the Rwandan genocide\n(number seven), where 700,000 people were killed in a hundred days.*\nThis suggests both good and bad news. Compared with the past, we\nare extraordinarily different in terms of whom we extend rights to and\nfeel empathy for and what global ills we counter. And things are better in\nterms of fewer people acting violently and societies attempting to contain\nthem. But the bad news is that the reach of the violent few is ever\ngreater. They don’t just rage about events on another continent—they\ntravel there and wreak havoc. The charismatically violent inspire\nthousands in chat rooms instead of a mob in their village. Like-minded\nlone wolves more readily meet and metastasize. And the chaos once let\nloose with a cudgel or machete occurs now with an automatic weapon or\nbomb, with far more horrific consequences. Things have improved. But\nthat doesn’t mean they’re good.\nirst there’s the strategy for reducing violence that stretches back tens\nof thousands of years—moving. If two individuals in a hunter-\ngatherer band are having tensions, one frequently shifts to a neighboring\nband, sometimes voluntarily, sometimes not. Similarly, interband\ntensions are reduced when one shifts to a different location, an advantage\nof nomadicism. A recent study of the hunter-gathering Hadza of\nTanzania showed an additional benefit to this fluidity straight out of\nchapter 10. Specifically, it facilitates highly cooperative individuals\nassociating with one another.6\nThen there are the beneficial effects of trade, as emphasized by\nanthropologists, as well as Pinker. From trading at a village market to\nsigning international trade agreements, it is often true that where goods\ndo not pass frontiers, armies will. It’s a version of Thomas Friedman’s\nsomewhat tongue-in-cheek Golden Arches Theory of peace—countries\nwith McDonald’s don’t fight one another. While there are exceptions\n(e.g., the U.S. invasion of Panama, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon),\nFriedman’s broad point holds—countries that are sufficiently stable that\nthey are integrated into global markets with the likes of McDonald’s and\nprosperous enough that their people keep those establishments in\nbusiness likely conclude that the trade advantages of peace outweigh the\nimagined spoils of war.**7\nThis isn’t surefire—for example, despite being major trading\npartners, Germany and the UK fought World War I—and there’s no\nshortage of people willing to go to war, even at the cost of disrupted\ntrade and scarce commodities. Moreover, “trade” is double-edged. It’s\ncertifiably groovy when occurring between indigenous rain forest\nhunters; it’s certifiably vile if you’re protesting the WTO. But as long as\ncountries can wage war on distant nations, long-distance trade that\nmakes them interdependent is a good deterrent.\nCultural diffusion in general (which includes trade) can also facilitate\nReligion\nWell, I’d love to skip this section, but I can’t. That’s because religion\nis arguably our most defining cultural invention, an incredibly powerful\ncatalyst for both our best and worst behaviors.\nWhen introducing the pituitary in chapter 4, I didn’t feel obliged to\nfirst disclose my feelings about the gland. But the equivalent feels\nappropriate here. Thus: I was raised highly observant and Orthodox, felt\nintensely religious. But then, around age thirteen, the whole edifice\ncollapsed; ever since, I’ve been incapable of any religiosity or\nspirituality and more readily focus on religion’s destructive than its\nbeneficial aspects. But I like being around religious people and am\nmoved by them—while baffled by how they can believe that stuff. And I\nfervently wish that I could. The end.\nAs emphasized in chapter 9, we’ve created a staggering variety of\nreligions. In considering solely religions with worldwide reaches, there\nare some important commonalities:\na. They all involve facets of religiosity that are intensely\npersonal, solitary, and individualized, as well as facets\nthat are about community; as we’ll see, these are very\ndifferent realms when it comes to fostering our best and\nworst behaviors.\nb. All involve personal and communal ritualized behaviors\nthat comfort in times of anxiety; however, many of those\nanxieties were created by the religion itself.\nThe anxiety-reducing effects of belief are\nlogical, given that psychological stress is about lack\nof control, predictability, outlets, and social support.\nDepending on the religion, belief brings an\nexplanation for why things happen, a conviction that\nthere is a purpose, and the sense of a creator who is\ncommunity support that it brings and the decreased\nrates of substance abuse).\nRecall the role of the anterior cingulate cortex\n(ACC) in sounding an alarm when there is a\ndiscrepancy between how you thought things\nworked and how they actually do. After controlling\nfor personality and cognitive abilities, more\nreligious people show less ACC activation when\ngetting news of a negative discrepancy. Other\nstudies show the anxiety-reducing effects of\nrepetitive religious rituals.9\nc. Finally, all the world religions distinguish between Us\nand Them, though they differ as to what is required to be\nan Us and whether the pertinent attributes are\nimmutable.\nEnough is known about the neurobiology of religiosity that there’s\neven a journal called Religion, Brain and Behavior. Reciting a familiar\nprayer activates mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Improvising one\nactivates regions associated with Theory of Mind, as you try to\nunderstand a deity’s perspective (“God wants me to be humble in\naddition to grateful; better make sure I mention that”). Moreover, more\nactivation of this Theory of Mind network correlates with a more\npersonified image of a deity. Believing that someone is faith healing\ndeactivates the (cognitive) dlPFC, suspending disbelief. And performing\na familiar ritual activates cortical regions associated with habit and\nreflexive evaluation.10\nSo are religious people nicer than nonreligious ones? It depends on\nwhether they’re interacting with in- or out-group members. Okay, are\nreligious people nicer to in-group members? Numerous studies say yes—\nmore volunteering (with or without a religious context), charitable\ngiving, and spontaneous prosociality, more generosity, trust, honesty, and\nforgiveness in economic games. However, numerous studies show no\ndifferences.11\nthose religious people who strongly need social approval. As more\ncontext dependency, in one study religious people were more charitable\nthan nonreligious ones—but only on their Sabbath.12\nAnother important issue: what kind of religion? As introduced in\nchapter 9, Ara Norenzayan, Azim Shariff, and Joseph Henrich of the\nUniversity of British Columbia have identified links between features of\nvarious religions and aspects of prosociality.13 As we saw, small-band\ncultures (such as hunter-gatherers) rarely invent moralizing deities. It is\nnot until cultures are large enough that people regularly interact\nanonymously with strangers that it becomes commonplace to invent a\njudgmental god—the Judeo-Christian/Muslim deity.\nIn such cultures overt and subliminal religious cues boost\nprosociality. In one study religious subjects unscrambled sentences that\ndid or didn’t contain religious terms (e.g., spirit, divine, sacred); doing\nthe former prompted generosity afterward. This is reminiscent of chapter\n3’s finding that merely seeing a pair of eyes posted on a wall makes\npeople more prosocial. And showing that this is about being monitored,\nunscrambling sentences with secular terms such as “jury,” “police,” or\n“contract” had the same effect.14\nThus reminders of a judgmental god(s) boosts prosociality. It also\nmatters what that deity does about transgressions. Within and among\ncultures, the more punitive the god, the more generosity to an\nanonymous coreligionist. Do punitive gods make for more punitive\npeople (at least in an economic game)? In one study, no—save your cash,\nGod’s got it covered. In another, yes—a punitive god would want me to\nbe punitive as well. The UBC group has shown something ironic.\nPriming people to think of God as punitive decreases cheating; thinking\nof God as forgiving increases it. The researchers then studied subjects\nfrom sixty-seven countries, considering the prevalence in each of belief\nin the existence of a heaven and hell. The greater the skew toward belief\nin hell, rather than heaven, the lower the national crime rate. When it\ncomes to Eternity, sticks apparently work better than carrots.\nAnd what about religion facilitating the worst in us, with respect to\nThems? Well, one piece of evidence for this is, uh, like, human history.\ngenerally attributed to Napoleon, “people killing each other over who\nhas the better imaginary friend,” to secular ones where, nevertheless,\nomniscient support is requested and proclaimed. Religion is a\nparticularly tenacious catalyst of violence. Catholics and Protestants\nhave been killing each other in Europe for nearly 500 years, Shiites and\nSunnis for 1,300. Violent disagreements about differing economic or\ngovernmental models never last as long—this would be like people still\nkilling each other today over, say, Eastern Roman Emperor Heraclius’s\n610 decision to switch the official language from Latin to Greek. As\nshown in a study of six hundred terrorist groups spanning forty years,\nreligiously based terrorism persists the longest and is least likely to\nsubside due to fighters joining the political process.\nReligious primes foster out-group hostility. In a “field study” where\npeople were surveyed in different locations in a cosmopolitan European\ncity, merely walking past a church made Christians express more\nconservative, negative attitudes toward non-Christians. Another study\nexamined the priming effects of a violent god. Subjects read a Bible\npassage in which a woman is murdered by a mob from another tribe. Her\nhusband consults with his tribesmen and forms an army that takes\nrevenge by attacking the other tribe (in biblical fashion, destroying their\ncities and killing every human and animal). Half the subjects were told\nthis story. In the story told to the other half, while contemplating\nloser was blasted with a loud noise at a volume chosen by the other\nplayer. Reading the scene where God sanctions their desire for violence\nincreased the volume with which opponents were chastened.\nNo surprise: the effect was bigger in males than in females. Big\nsurprise: subjects were either devout Mormons at Brigham Young\nUniversity or students of typically liberal religions at a Dutch university,\nand the effect was equally strong in both groups. Biggest surprise: even\namong subjects who did not subscribe to the Bible (a surprisingly high 1\npercent of the Brigham Young students and 73 percent of the Dutch),\ngodly sanction increased their aggressiveness (though to a lesser extent).\nThus, divine sanction of violence can increase aggression even in people\nwhose religiosity probably doesn’t include a vengeful god, as well as\namong those who don’t even believe there’s divine anything.\nOf course, this is not a uniform effect of religion; Norenzayan\ndistinguishes between private and communal religiosity in surveying\nsupport for suicide bombers among Palestinians.17 In a refutation of\n“Islam = terrorism” idiocy, people’s personal religiosity (as assessed by\nhow often they prayed) didn’t predict support for terrorism. However,\nthe world’s troubles. In all cases frequent attendance of religious\nservices, but not frequent prayer, predicted those views. It’s not\nreligiosity that stokes intergroup hostility; it’s being surrounded by\ncoreligionists who affirm parochial identity, commitment, and shared\nloves and hatreds. This is hugely important.\n—\nWhat should one make of these various findings? Religiosity isn’t going\nanywhere.* Given that, it seems that boosting in-group sociality is best\ndone with a moralizing, punitive god. The standard, wearisome critique\nof atheism is that lack of a god(s) produces nihilistic amorality; the\nstandard response is that it’s pretty unimpressive if you are kind only\nbecause you fear damnation. Unimpressive or not, it appears to be useful.\nThe big challenge is when communal aspects of religiosity fuel out-\ngroup hostility. It’s useless to call for religions to broaden the extent of\ntheir Us-ness. Religions are quirky as to who is an Us, ranging from\n“only those who look, act, talk, and pray like people in our sect” to “all\nof life.” It will be discouragingly tough to shift religions from the former\nto the latter.\nContact\nAs introduced in chapter 11, many have speculated that inter-group\ntensions are reduced by contact—when people get to know one another,\neveryone gets along. But despite that salutary possibility, intergroup\ncontact readily elevates hostilities.18\nAs seen in chapter 9, intergroup contact worsens things when the two\ngroups are treated unequally or are unequal in number; where the smaller\ngroup is surrounded; where intergroup boundaries are ambiguous; when\nthe groups vie to display symbols of their sacred values (e.g., Northern\nIrish Protestants marching with Orangemen flags through Catholic\nneighborhoods). Elbows rubbed raw.\nObviously, the opposite is needed to minimize threat and anxiety—\ngroups encountering each other in equal numbers and treatment, in a\ncombined Us to the forefront.\nUnder those conditions, sustained intergroup contact generally\ndecreases prejudices, often to a large extent and in a generalized,\npersistent manner. This was the conclusion of a 2006 meta-analysis of\nsome five hundred studies comprising over 250,000 subjects from thirty-\neight countries; beneficial effects were roughly equal for group\ndifferences in race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. As\nexamples, a 1957 study concerning desegregation of the Merchant\nMarines showed that the more trips white seamen took with African\nAmericans, the more positive their racial attitudes. Same for white cops\nas a function of time spent with African American partners.19\nA more recent meta-analysis provides additional insights: (a) The\nbeneficial effects typically involve both more knowledge about and more\nempathy for the Thems. (b) The workplace is a particularly effective\nplace for contact to do its salutary thing. Decreased prejudice about the\nThems at work often generalizes to Thems at large, and even sometimes\nto other types of Thems. (c) Contact between a traditionally dominant\ngroup and a subordinate minority usually decreases prejudice more in the\nformer; the latter have higher thresholds. (d) Novel routes of interacting\n—such as sustained online relationships—can work a bit as well.20\nAll good news. Contact theory has prompted an experimental\napproach where people, most typically adolescents or young adults, from\ngroups in conflict are brought together for anything from one-hour\ndiscussions to summer camps. They’ve most frequently involved\nPalestinians and Israelis, Northern Irish Catholics and Protestants, or\nopposing groups from the Balkans, Rwanda, or Sri Lanka, with the idea\nthat participants will return home and spread their attitudinal shifts. This\nnotion of germination prompted the name of one such program, Seeds of\nPeace.\nGroup pictures show Muslims and Jews, Catholics and Protestants,\nTutsis and Hutu, Croats and Bosnians arm in arm; this is better than\npuppies. Do the programs work? Depends on what counts as “working.”\nAccording to one expert, Stephen Worchel of the University of Hawaii,\nThis is the immediate aftermath. Disappointingly, these effects are\nusually transient. Individuals from across lines rarely stay in touch; in\none survey of Palestinian and Israeli teenagers, 91 percent were not.\nPersistent reductions in prejudice usually involve exceptionalism—“Yes,\nmost Thems are awful, but I hung out with a Them once who was okay.”\nWhen there is major transformation, the peace-mongering convert loses\nstreet cred back home when they broadcast this. For example, no\nprominent peace activist has emerged from the thousands of participants\nin the Middle Eastern Seeds of Peace.*\nHere’s a way to think about contact: instead of hating a Them for\nwhat his ancestors did, you await the day that you’re irritated with him\nfor, say, eating the last s’more, or setting the office thermostat too low, or\nnever returning to its proper place in the barn that plowshare that used to\nbe a sword. Now, that’s progress. The core of that thought is Susan\nFiske’s demonstration that automatic other-race-face amygdala responses\ncan be undone when subjects think of that face as belonging to a person,\nnot a Them. The ability to individuate even monolithic and\ndeindividuated monsters can be remarkable.\nA moving example of this is told by Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela in\nher book A Human Being Died That Night: A South African Story of\nForgiveness (Cape Town: David Philip, 2003). Gobodo-Madikizela,\nraised in a black township of apartheid South Africa, managed to forge\nan educational path all the way to a PhD in clinical psychology. As a free\nSouth Africa dawned, she worked on the Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission, where she had a task to give anyone pause. It concerned\nEugene de Kock, the man with the most literal apartheid-era blood on his\nhands. De Kock had commanded the elite counterinsurgency unit of the\nSouth African Police and personally overseen kidnappings, torture, and\nmurders of black activists. He had been tried, convicted, and given a life\nsentence. Gobodo-Madikizela was to interview him about his death\nsquad; clinical psychologist that she is, over the course of over forty\nhours talking with him, her main focus became to understand this man.\nHe was a predictably multifaceted, contradictory, real human, rather\nthan an archetype. He was remorseful in some ways, unrepentant in\nemphasizing his command of his killers. He shattered her by tentatively\nasking if he had killed any of her loved ones (he had not).\nAnd Gobodo-Madikizela found herself deeply troubled by her\ngrowing empathy for de Kock.\nA defining moment came one day when de Kock was recounting\nsomething that made him markedly distressed. Gobodo-Madikizela\nreflexively reached out and—a taboo act—touched his finger between\nthe jail bars. The next morning her arm felt leaden, as if paralyzed by the\ntouch. She struggled with whether her granting him this contact was a\nsign of her power or his (with him somehow manipulating her into the\nact). When she next saw him, he compounded her storm of feelings by\nthanking her and confessing that it was his trigger hand that she had\ntouched. No, this was not the start of an unlikely friendship, as violins\nplay in the background. But the automaticity, the empathy implicit in her\nreaching out to him, shows that somehow, remarkably, the tenuous\nelements of Us-ness she now shared with de Kock had dominated at that\nmoment.\nBurning and Unburning Bridges\nA phenomenon in many settings of conflict is burning cultural\nbridges as a way to forge a new, powerful Us category. Consider the Mau\nMau rebellion in Kenya in the 1950s. The brunt of British colonialism in\nKenya had focused on one tribe, the Kikuyu, who had the bad luck of\nliving on precisely the rich farm land that the colonials appropriated;\nKikuyu suffering finally boiled over into the Mau Mau insurrection.*\nThe agricultural Kikuyu were not particularly bellicose (unlike, say,\nthe nearby pastoralist Maasai, who had been terrorizing the Kikuyu\nforever), and inculcating new Mau Mau fighters required powerful\nsymbolic effort. Oath making had great cultural significance to Kikuyus,\nand Mau Mau oath making notoriously involved horrendous violations\nof Kikuyu norms and taboos, acts guaranteeing shunning at home. The\nmessage was clear: “You have burned a bridge; your only Us is us.”\nThis strategy is often used in a horrifying realm of modern violence,\n631\nbridges. But also, perhaps reflecting recognition of kids’ limited abstract\ncognition, something more concrete is employed—the forced killing of\nfamily members by such children. We are your family now.\nWhen child soldiers are liberated, their chances of growing into\nhealthy, functioning adults soars if a relative is found who will accept\nthem. If a bridge is unburned.22\n—\n\nHaram. What these girls experienced is unimaginable—terror, pain,\nforced labor, endless rapes, pregnancies, AIDS. And as these few are\nreturned home, many are shunned—for their AIDS, for the belief that\nthey’ve been brainwashed into being sleeper terrorists, for the rape-born\nchildren they carry. This does not auger well for their being anything\nother than broken forever.\nChapter 11 emphasized pseudospeciation, when Thems are made to\nseem so different that they hardly count as human. Chapter 15\nconsidered the skill of demagogues at this, framing hated Thems as\ninsects, rodents, bacteria, malignancies, and feces. That provides a clear\npunch line: be wary of rabble-rousers who frame Thems as things to step\non, spray with toxins, or flush down toilets. Simple.\nBut pseudospeciating propaganda can be subtler. In the fall of 1990\nIraq invaded Kuwait, and in the run-up to the Gulf War, Americans were\nsickened by a story that emerged. On October 10, 1990, a fifteen-year-\nold refugee from Kuwait appeared before a congressional Human Rights\nCaucus.23\nThe girl—she would give only her first name, Nayirah—had\nvolunteered in a hospital in Kuwait City. She tearfully testified that Iraqi\nsoldiers had stolen incubators to ship home as plunder, leaving over three\nhundred premature infants to die.\nOur collective breath was taken away—“These people leave babies\nto die on the cold floor; they are hardly human.” The testimony was seen\non the news by approximately 45 million Americans, was cited by seven\nsenators when justifying their support of war (a resolution that passed by\nfive votes), and was cited more than ten times by George H. W. Bush in\narguing for U.S. military involvement. And we went to war with a 92\npercent approval rating of the president’s decision. In the words of\nRepresentative John Porter (R-Illinois), who chaired the committee, after\nNayirah’s testimony, “we have never heard, in all this time, in all\ncircumstances, a record of inhumanity, and brutality, and sadism, as the\nones that [Nayirah had] given us today.”\nMuch later it emerged that the incubator story was a\npseudospeciating lie. The refugee was no refugee. She was Nayirah al-\nby the firm indicated that people would be particularly responsive to\nstories about atrocities against babies (ya think?), so the incubator tale\nwas concocted, the witness coached. The story was disavowed by human\nrights groups (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) and the\nmedia, and the testimony was withdrawn from the Congressional Record\n—long after the war.\nBe careful when our enemies are made to remind us of maggots and\ncancer and shit. But also beware when it is our empathic intuitions,\nrather than our hateful ones, that are manipulated by those who use us for\ntheir own goals.\nCooperation\nAs explored in chapter 10, understanding the evolution of\ncooperation poses two challenges.\nThe first is the fundamental problem of how cooperation ever starts;\nthe dispiriting logic of the Prisoner’s Dilemma shows that whoever takes\nthe first cooperative step becomes one step behind.\nAs we saw, one plausible solution concerns founder populations—\nwhen a subset of a population becomes isolated and its average degree of\nrelatedness rises, fueling cooperation through kin selection.24 Should that\nfounder population rejoin the general population, their cooperative\ntendencies will outcompete everyone else, thus propagating cooperation.\nAnother solution involves green-beard effects, that poor man’s version of\nkin selection, where a genetic trait generates a conspicuous marker and a\ncooperative bent toward bearers of that marker. In that setting the green\nbeard–less will be outcompeted unless they also evolve cooperation. As\nwe saw, green-beard effects occur in various species.\nThis raises the second challenge, namely understanding why humans\nare so extraordinarily cooperative with nonrelatives. We hold elevator\ndoors open for strangers, take turns at four-way stop signs, get off buses\nin an orderly manner. We build cultures involving millions of people\nsharing conventions. This requires more than founder effects and green\nbeards; in the years since Hamilton and Axelrod made “tit for tat” trendy,\ndecrees that you defect; there’ll never be a chance to catch up if you fall\nbehind in that first round. What about two rounds? Well, the second\nround requires noncooperation for the same reasons the single-round\ngame does. In other words, it never makes sense to cooperate in the final\nround. Thus, round 2 behavior determined, the game defaults to a single-\nround game—where the rational strategy is to defect. Three rounds? The\nsame. In other words, playing for a known number of rounds biases\nagainst cooperation, and the more rational the players, the more they\nforesee this. It’s open-ended play that fosters cooperation—an unknown\nnumber of rounds, producing the shadow of the future, where retribution\nis possible and the advantages of sustained mutual cooperation\naccumulate with increasing numbers of interactions.25\nMultiple games. Two individuals play two games against each other\nsimultaneously (alternating rounds between the two) where one game\nhas a much lower threshold for establishing cooperation than the other.\nOnce cooperation is established in that less cutthroat game, there is\npsychological spillover of cooperation into the other. This is why\nmanagers of tense, competitive offices bring in soothing outsiders to lead\ntrust games, hoping that the low-threshold demands for trust there will\nspill over into work life.\nOpen-book play. This is where the other player can see if you’ve been a\njerk to people in the past. Reputation is a powerful facilitator of\ncooperation. That’s what a moralizing god is about—the book whose\nplay is eternally open. As we saw in chapter 9, everyone from hunter-\ngatherers to urbanites gossip, doing so to open reputation books wider.26\nOpen-book play mediates a uniquely sophisticated type of human\ncooperation, namely “indirect reciprocity.” Person A helps person B,\nwho helps C, who helps D. . . . The reciprocity between two individuals\nin a closed interaction is like barter. But indirect, pay-it-forward\nreciprocity is like money, where the common currency is reputation.27\nPunishment\ntroop for a while by the victim and her relatives. Punishment can\nstrongly facilitate cooperation, but its implementation is potentially\ndouble-edged in humans.\nAll cultures show some degree of willingness to pay a cost to punish\nnorm violators, and high degrees of willingness correlate with high\nlevels of prosociality. One study examined rural Ethiopians who\nsubsisted on selling charcoal made from wood from local forests—a\nclassic tragedy of the commons scenario: no one is likely to\nspontaneously limit logging to keep the forest healthy. The study showed\nthat villages with high average levels of willingness to administer costly\npunishment in an economic game were the ones with the most patrols to\nprevent overcutting of trees and the healthiest forests. And as seen in\nchapter 9, cultures with gods who punish norm violations are atypically\nprosocial.28\nA complication in costly punishment is the cost—the danger that the\ncosts of monitoring for and punishing violations may outweigh the\nbenefits of the cooperation induced. A solution is to reduce surveillance\nafter long stretches of cooperation—in other words, to trust. For\nexample, probably very few Amish purchase costly retinal-scanner home\nsecurity systems.29\nAnother complication concerns who does the punishing. In other\nspecies it is usually the victim, the second party. By definition,\npunishment in two-person games in humans (e.g., the Ultimatum Game)\nis always by the second party. In that setting the punisher forgoes the\nmeasly share offered, (a) in the hopes of deriving visceral satisfaction\nfrom depriving the first party of their larger share (and, as seen in the last\nchapter, that is a major motivator of punishment, fueled by the amygdala\nand insula); (b) in an effort to shape the first party into making fairer\noffers to the second party in the future; or (c) as an altruistic act, hoping\nto shape the first party into being more decent to whomever they play\nnext. This is complex for second parties, balancing costs and benefits,\nheart and mind, birds in the hand and in the bush. It might also result in\nthe first party being offended by the rejection and becoming even less\ncooperative thereafter—an outcome in some game scenarios.30\njump-starting altruistic third-party punishment.31\nThe answer, as repeatedly derived by humans, is to add layers.\nDevelop secondary punishment, punishing someone who fails to do\nthird-party punishment—the world of honor codes, where you’re\npunished if you don’t report a violation. An alternative is to reward third-\nparty punishers—humans make livings as cops and judges. Moreover,\nrecent theoretical and empirical work shows that being a conspicuous\nthird-party punisher makes people trust you. But who monitors third-\nparty punishers? Here is where you get people to share and lower the\ncost by taking sociality to the max—costs are shouldered by everyone,\nand free riders are punished (e.g., we pay taxes and punish tax evaders).\nWhen the moving parts are balanced, you generate extraordinary levels\nof cooperation.32\nThe moving parts were examined in a fascinating 2010 Science\npaper. The authors studied 113,000 online participants, who each\npurchased an item (a souvenir photo) under one of the following\nconditions:33\na. Could buy for a set price. (This was the control\ncondition.)\nb. Could pay whatever they wanted; sales soared but\npeople tended to pay tiny amounts, putting the “store” in\nthe red.\nc. Were charged the original price, knowing that the\ncompany gave X percent of earnings to charity; sales\nincreased, but less than X percent, and the store lost\nmoney.\nd. Could pay whatever they wanted, with half of that going\nto a charity. This boosted both sales and the price\nvoluntarily paid, yielding profits for the store and a large\ncharitable contribution.\nChoosing Your Partner\nAs we’ve seen, cooperators outcompete more numerous\nnoncooperators to the extent that the former can find one another. This is\nthe logic behind green beards facilitating finding a kindred soul (if not\nkin). Thus, when that element is introduced into a game (with the ability\nto refuse to play with someone), cooperation soars, and more cheaply\nthan by punishing defectors.34\n—\nThese findings reveal numerous theoretical routes for fostering\ncooperation, and with real-life equivalents; moreover, we’ve learned a lot\nabout which work best when. This is how we’ve evolved to collectively\nraise barns for neighbors, plant and harvest the whole village’s rice crop,\nor coordinate marching-band members to form a picture of their school’s\nmascot.\nAnd, oh yeah, to reiterate an idea aired previously, “cooperation” is a\nvalue-free term. Sometimes it takes a village to ransack a neighboring\nvillage.\nReconciliation, and Things That Are Not\nSynonymous with It\n“So I’d caught a colobus monkey and was eating, getting to the good\npart, when this guy comes by, starts really begging for some. This got on\nmy nerves and I snarled at him. Instead of taking a hint, he lunges, grabs\nthe monkey’s arm, starts yanking—so I bit his shoulder. He cleared out\nfast and sat at the other end of the clearing, his back to me.\n“Once I calmed down, I thought a bit. To be honest, I probably\nshould have shared some food with him. And while he definitely crossed\na line when he grabbed, I probably should have nipped him instead of a\nI give him some of the meat, he grooms me a bit. The whole thing was\nstupid, we should have done that in the first place.”\nIf you’re a chimp, reconciliation is easy once your heart rate returns\nto normal. Sometimes for us too—touch a friend’s shoulder, give a self-\neffacing grimace, say, “Hey, look, just now I was being a—” and they cut\nyou off, saying, “No, no, it was me. I shouldn’t . . .” and things are okay.\nEasy. How about when everyone’s trying to patch things up after\nyour people have slaughtered three quarters of theirs, or after they came\nas colonials, stole your land, and forced you to live in slum “homelands”\nfor decades? Trickier.\nWe’re the only species that institutionalizes reconciliation and that\ngrapples with “truth,” “apology,” “forgiveness,” “reparations,”\n“amnesty,” and “forgetting.”\nThe apogee of institutionalized complexity is the truth and\nreconciliation commission (TRC). The first came in the 1980s, and\nthey’ve been depressingly useful ever since, occurring, for example, in\nBolivia, Canada, Australia, Nepal, Rwanda, and Poland. Some TRCs\nhave been in stable countries (Canada and Australia) facing up to their\nlong history of abuse of indigenous peoples. Most, however, have come\nafter a nation emerged from a bloody, divisive transition—a dictator\noverthrown, a civil war settled, a genocide halted. The popular\nperception is that their purpose is for perpetrators of abuse to confess,\nexpress remorse, and beg for forgiveness from victims, who then grant it,\nresulting in tearful embraces between the two.\nBut instead TRCs are typically exercises in pragmatism, where\nperpetrators basically say, “This is what I did, and I vow to never harm\nyour people again,” and the victims basically say, “Okay, we vow to not\nseek extrajudicial retribution.” An often towering achievement, if less\nheartwarming.\nProbably the best-studied TRC was South Africa’s after the defeat of\napartheid. It came with enormous moral legitimacy, being overseen by\nDesmond Tutu, and gained further legitimacy by, though\noverwhelmingly focusing on the acts of whites, also examining atrocities\nby African liberation fighters. Hearings were public and included victims\nrequired, and few did. The goal was not to transform those individuals; it\nwas to increase the odds that the shattered nation would function. In\nfollow-up studies by the South African Centre for the Study of Violence\nand Reconciliation, victim participants commonly felt “that the TRC had\nbeen more successful at the national than the local level.” Many were\noutraged that there were no apologies, no reparations, that many\nperpetrators remained in their jobs. Interestingly, echoing chapter 15,\nmany were equally angry about symbolic changes that had not occurred\n—not only is this killer still a cop, but there’s still a\nholiday/monument/street name celebrating apartheid. A wide majority of\nblack (but not white) South Africans saw the TRC as fair and successful,\nand it accompanied South Africa’s miraculously transitioning to\nfreedom, rather than descending into civil war. Thus TRCs show the\ndifferences between reconciliation and the likes of remorse and\nforgiveness.*35\nAs every parent knows, a transparently insincere apology\naccomplishes little and can even worsen things. But deep remorse is\ndifferent. The New Yorker recounts the story of Lu Lobello, an American\nIraq War veteran who accidentally killed three members of a family,\ncollateral damage during a firefight; haunted by it, he spent nine years\ntracking down the survivors to apologize. Or consider Hazel Bryan\nMassery, the snarling white teenager at the center of the iconic 1957\ncivil-rights-movement photograph of Elizabeth Eckford attempting to\nintegrate Little Rock Central High School. A few years later Massery\ncontacted Eckford to apologize.36\nDo apologies “work”? It depends. One issue is what the person is\napologizing for, ranging from the concrete (“I’m sorry I broke your toy”)\nto the global and essentialist (“I’m sorry I’ve viewed your people as not\nfully human”). Another is what the apologizer aims to do about their\nremorse. And there’s the makeup of the recipient of the apology. Studies\nshow that (a) victims who are oriented toward the workings of a\ncollective system respond most to apologies that emphasize failure of\nthat system (“I’m sorry, we police are supposed to protect, not break\nlaws”); (b) victims most oriented to relationships respond most to\nmean that in 1993 Bill Clinton apologized to Japanese Americans for\ntheir World War II internment? While the apology was laudable, and\naccompanied by reparative money, could Clinton speak for FDR?37\nThe issue of reparations is immensely complicated. At one extreme,\nreparations can be the ultimate proof of sincerity. This is at the heart of\nthe slavery reparations movement—so much of America’s growth into\neconomic privilege was built on slavery, and so many of the subsequent\nbenefits of the successful economy have been systematically denied to\nAfrican Americans, that there should be reparations to the descendants of\nslaves. At the other extreme, reparations meant to purchase forgiveness\noffend—this was the reasoning behind the newly born state of Israel’s\nrefusal of reparations from Germany, unless it was accompanied by\nadequate remorse.\nAt the end of these steps might arise one of the strangest things\nhumans do—we forgive.38 For starters, forgiving is not forgetting. If\nnothing else, that’s neurobiologically unlikely. A rat learns to associate a\nbell with a shock and freezes when it hears it. When the next day the bell\nrepeatedly sounds without being accompanied by a shock, causing the\nfreezing behavior to “extinguish,” the memory trace of that learning does\nnot evaporate. Instead it is overlaid with newer learning—“Today the\nbell is not bad news.” As proof, suppose that the day after that, the bell\nagain signals shock. If the initial learning of “bell = shock” had been\nerased, it would take as long this day to learn the association as it did the\nfirst. Instead there is rapid reacquisition: “bell = shock again.” Forgiving\nsomeone doesn’t mean you’ve forgotten what he did.\nThere is a subset of victims who claim to have forgiven the\nperpetrator, to have relinquished their anger and desire for punishment. I\ninclude the word “claim” not to imply skepticism but to indicate that\nforgiveness is a self-reported state that can be claimed but not proven.\nForgiveness can occur as a religious imperative. In the June 2015\nCharleston church massacre, white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine\nparishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Two\ndays later, at Roof’s arraignment, stunningly, family members of the\ndead were there to forgive him and pray for his soul.39\nwas convicted and sentenced to life in prison. In the years after, friends\ntentatively wondered if she could now put the nightmare behind her.\n“Like hell I’m able to” would be her response. She was consumed with\nher hatred for Cotton, with her desire to harm him. And then, more than\nten years into his prison sentence, DNA evidence exonerated Cotton.\nAnother man had done it; he was incarcerated in Cotton’s prison for\nother rapes and bragged about getting away with this one. Thompson-\nCannino had identified the wrong man and convinced a jury. Issues of\nhatred or forgiveness were now on the other foot.\nWhen they finally met, after Cotton’s release and pardon, Thompson-\nCannino said, “If I spent every minute of every hour of every day for the\nrest of my life telling you that I’m sorry, can you ever forgive me?” And\nCotton said, “Jennifer, I forgave you years ago.” His ability to do so\ninvolved profound reappraisal: “Forgiving Jennifer for picking me out of\nthat lineup as her rapist took less time than people think. I knew she was\na victim and was hurting real bad. . . . We were the victims of the same\ninjustice by the same man, and this gave us a common ground to stand\non.” A complete reappraisal that made them Us in their victimhood. The\ntwo now lecture together about the need for judicial reform.\nUltimately, forgiveness is usually about one thing—“This is for me,\nnot for you.” Hatred is exhausting; forgiveness, or even just indifference,\nis freeing. To quote Booker T. Washington, “I shall allow no man to\nbelittle my soul by making me hate him.” Belittle and distort and\nconsume. Forgiveness seems to be at least somewhat good for your\nhealth—victims who show spontaneous forgiveness, or who have gone\nthrough forgiveness therapy (as opposed to “anger validation therapy”)\nshow improvements in general health, cardiovascular function, and\nsymptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Chapter 14 explored how\ncompassion readily, perhaps inevitably, contains elements of self-\ninterest. The compassionate granting of forgiveness epitomizes this.41\nWe’ve now focused on forgiveness, apology, reparation,\nreconciliation, and the extent to which TRCs were about reconciliation\nrather than forgiveness. What about the “truth” part? It facilitates the\nRecognizing Our Irrationalities\nDespite the claims of some economists, we are not rational\noptimization machines. We are more generous in games than logic\npredicts; we decide if someone is guilty based on reasoning but then\ndecide their punishment based on emotion; roughly half of us make\ndifferent decisions about sacrificing one to save five, depending if it\ninvolves pushing a person versus pulling a lever; we effortlessly resist\ncheating in circumstances where no one would know; we make strong\nmoral decisions without being able to explain why. Thus it’s a good idea\nto recognize the systematic features to our irrationality.\nSometimes we aim to eliminate these irrationalities. Perhaps the most\nfundamental one is the common visceral resistance to a simple fact—you\ndon’t make treaties with friends; it’s to be expected that you passionately\nhate those whose hands you are about to shake, and that can’t be an\nimpediment to doing so. Another domain concerns discrepancies\nbetween our conscious opinions and what our implicit biases lead us to\ndo. As we saw, Us/Them edges can be softened when implicit biases are\nmade explicit. Doing so need not eliminate that bias—after all, you can’t\nreadily reason yourself out of a belief that you weren’t originally\nreasoned into. Instead, revealing implicit biases indicates where to focus\nyour monitoring to lessen their impact. This notion can be applied to all\nthe realms of our behaviors being shaped by something implicit,\nsubliminal, interoceptive, unconscious, subterranean—and where we\nthen post-hoc rationalize our stance. For example, every judge should\nlearn that judicial decisions are sensitive to how long it’s been since they\nate.\nAnother example to watch out for is the human potential for\nirrational optimism. For example, while people might accurately assess\nthe risk of a behavior, they tend toward distortive optimism when\nassessing risk to themselves—“Nah, that couldn’t happen to me.”\nIrrational optimism can be great; it’s why only about 15 percent instead\nof 99 percent of humans get clinically depressed. But as emphasized by\nthose of the opposition—“piece of cake, full steam ahead” becomes the\nlogical conclusion.42\nA final domain of irrationality that must be recognized concerns\nchapter 15’s “sacred values,” where purely symbolic acts can count for\nmore than hard-nosed material concessions. Rationality may be key to\nestablishing peace, but the irrational importance of sacred values is key\nto establishing lasting peace.\nOur Incompetence at and Aversion to Killing\nVideo cameras are sufficiently ubiquitous these days to make\n“privacy” a threatened phenomenon. One consequence of such ubiquity\nis that scientists can be voyeuristic in new ways. Which has produced an\ninteresting finding.\nIt concerns riots in soccer stadiums—“football hooliganism,” battles\nbetween ethnic or nationalist groups, partisans of each team, or often\nright-wing skinheads going at it. Footage of such events shows that few\npeople actually fight. Most are on the sidelines watching or running\naround like agitated, headless chickens. Of those who fight, most throw\nan ineffectual punch or two before discovering that punching makes your\nhand hurt. The actual fighters are a tiny subset. As stated by one\nresearcher, “humans are bad at [close-range, hand-to-hand] violence,\neven if civilization makes us a bit better at it.”43\nEven more interesting is the evidence of our strong inhibitions\nagainst doing grievous harm to someone up close.\nThe definitive exploration of this is the 1995 book On Killing: The\nPsychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, by David\nGrossman, a professor of military science and retired U.S. Army\ncolonel.44\nHe frames the book around something noted after the Battle of\nGettysburg. Of the almost 27,000 single-load muskets recovered from\nthe field, almost 24,000 of them were loaded and unfired; 12,000 were\nloaded multiple times, 6,000 loaded three to ten times. Lots of soldiers\nnot the infantry on the ground. In the heat of crazed battle, most men\nwould load, tend to the wounded, shout orders, run away, or wander in a\ndaze.\nSimilarly, in World War II only 15 to 20 percent of riflemen ever\nfired their guns. The rest? Running messages, helping people load\nammunition, tending to buddies—but not aiming a rifle at someone\nnearby and pulling a trigger.\nPsychologists of warfare emphasize how, in the heat of battle, people\ndon’t shoot another human out of hatred or obedience, or even from\nknowing that this enemy is trying to kill them. Instead it’s the\npseudokinship of bands of brothers—to protect your buddies, to not let\nthe guys next to you down. But outside those motivations, humans show\na strong natural aversion to killing at close range. The most resistance is\nagainst hand-to-hand combat with a knife or bayonet. Next comes short-\nrange firing with a pistol, then long-range firing, all the way to the\neasiest, which is bombs and artillery.\nThe resistance can be psychologically modified. It’s easier when you\naren’t targeting an identified individual—throwing a grenade into a\ngroup rather than shooting at one person. Killing as an individual is\nharder than in a group—while only that small subset of World War II\nriflemen fired their weapons, nearly all weapons operated by a team\n(e.g., machine guns) were fired. Responsibility is diluted, much as when\na firing squad would know that one of them had received a blank,\nallowing every shooter to know that they might not have actually killed\nsomeone.\nGrossman’s premise is supported by something new and startling.\nSince it morphed from “battle fatigue” or “shell shock” into a formal\npsychiatric illness, combat PTSD has been framed as a result of the sheer\nterror of being under attack, of someone trying to kill you and those\naround you. As we’ve seen, it is an illness where fear conditioning is\novergeneralized and pathological, an amygdala grown large,\nhyperreactive, and convinced that you are never safe. But consider drone\npilots—soldiers who sit in control rooms in the United States, directing\ntechnology of extraordinary quality. A target is identified, and a drone\nmight be positioned invisibly high in the sky over the person’s house for\nweeks, the drone operators always watching, waiting, say, for a gathering\nof targets in the house. You watch the target coming and going, eating\ndinner, taking a nap on his deck, playing with his kids. And then comes\nthe command to fire, to release your Hellfire missile at supersonic speed.\nHere’s one drone pilot, describing his first “kill”—three Afghanis\ntargeted from his air force base in Nevada. The missile has hit, and he\nwatches through an infrared camera, which transmits heat signatures:\nThe smoke clears, and there’s pieces of the two guys around the\ncrater. And there’s this guy over here, and he’s missing his right\nleg above his knee. He’s holding it, and he’s rolling around, and\nthe blood is squirting out of his leg, and it’s hitting the ground,\nand it’s hot. His blood is hot. But when it hits the ground, it starts\nto cool off; the pool cools fast. It took him a long time to die. I\njust watched him. I watched him become the same color as the\nground he was lying on.45\nBut there would be more. Pilots wait to see who retrieves the bodies,\nwho comes to the funeral, ready to perhaps release another strike. Or in\nother circumstances the pilot might watch as an American convoy\napproaches a roadside IED booby trap, unable to warn them, or watch\ninsurgents execute a shrieking civilian begging for mercy.\nThe pilot above was twenty-one when he made that first kill; he\nwould eventually accumulate 1,626 drone-mediated kills.* No personal\ndanger, an omnipresent eye in the sky. He could finish his shift and get a\ndoughnut on the way home. Yet he and many of his fellow drone pilots\nsuccumb to devastating PTSD.\nAfter reading Grossman, the explanation is simple. The deepest\ntrauma is not the fear of being killed. It’s doing the close-up,\nindividuated killing, watching someone for weeks and then turning him\nthe color of the ground. Grossman cites that during World War II there\nwere low rates of psychiatric breakdowns among sailors and medics—\ntrainees no longer fire at bull’s-eyes; instead it’s rapid-fire situations of\nmobile virtual-reality figures coming at you, where shooting becomes\nreflexive. In the Korean War, 55 percent of American riflemen fired their\nweapons; in the Vietnam War, over 90 percent. And this was before the\nrise of violent, desensitizing video games.\nMaybe there will soon be completely different types of wars. Perhaps\ndrones themselves will decide when to fire. Maybe wars will consist of\nautonomous weapons fighting each other, or each side racing to win with\nthe most effective cyberattack on the other’s computers. But as long as\nt’s remarkable the things humans can spend their lives studying. You\ncan be a coniologist or a caliologist, studying dust or birds’ nests,\nrespectively. There are batologists and brontologists, pondering brambles\nand thunder, and vexillologists and zygologists, with their dazzling\nknowledge of flags and of methods for fastening things. On and on—\nodontology and odonatology, phenology and phonology, parapsychology\nand parasitology. A rhinologist and a nosologist fall in love and have a\nchild who becomes a rhinological nosologist, studying the classification\nof nose diseases.\nThe preceding pages suggest the possibility of “peaceology,” the\nscientific study of the effects of trade, demographics, religion, intergroup\ncontact, reconciliation, and so on, on the ability of humans to live in\npeace. An intellectual venture with great potential to help the world.\nBut with each new example of us at our worst, from the pinpricks of\npetty meanness to massive carnage, this intellectual venture can feel like\nrolling a boulder uphill. And thus, to falsely separate cognition and\naffect, we conclude these many pages by fueling the emotional rather\nthan intellectual certainty that there is hope, that things can change, that\nwe can be changed, that we personally can cause change.\nRousseau with a Tail\nFor more than thirty years I spent my summers studying savanna\nbaboons in the Serengeti ecosystem in East Africa. I love baboons, but I\nmust admit that they’re often violent and abusive, so that the weak suffer\nat the canines of the strong. Okay, some detachment—they’re a highly\nsexually dimorphic tournament species with extensive escalated\naggression and a strong propensity toward frustration displacement—i.e.,\nanywhere in the wilds, it had always been a challenge keeping wildlife\nfrom feeding on food garbage. Hidden in a grove of trees far from the\nlodge was a deep garbage pit, surrounded by a fence. But baboons climb\nfences, fences get knocked down, gates are left open—and that\nneighboring troop had taken to foraging daily in the dump. Like another\nwidely dispersed primate, humans, baboons eat almost anything—fruit,\nplants, tubers, insects, eggs, prey they’ve killed, dead things they’ve\nscavenged.\nThe remainders of one of my males, the\nmorning after being attacked by a\ncoalition of rivals\nThis transformed the “Garbage\nDump” troop. Baboons normally\ndescend from their sleeping trees at\ndawn and walk ten miles a day\nforaging. Garbage Dumpers slept in\ntrees above the dump, waddled\ndown at eight o’clock to meet the\ngarbage tractor from the lodge, spend ten minutes in frenzied\ncompetition for discarded roast beef and drumsticks and plum pudding,\nand then waddle out for a nap. I’d even darted Garbage Dump animals\nand studied them with colleagues—they put on weight, thickened with\nhill, and soon half a dozen would head over each morning to join. It\nwasn’t random who did this, who would try to compete for food against\nfifty or sixty Thems. The ones who tried were male, big, and aggressive.\nAnd morning is when baboons do much of their socializing—sitting in\ncontact, grooming, playing—so going for garbage meant forgoing the\nsocializing. The males who went each morning were the most\naggressive, least affiliative members of the troop.\nNot long after, there was a tuberculosis outbreak among the Garbage\nDump baboons. In humans tuberculosis is a chronic disease, slowly\nconsuming you with “consumption.” In nonhuman primates, TB is\nwildfire, spreading rapidly, killing within weeks. Kenyan wildlife vet\ncolleagues and I identified the cause of the outbreak—the meat inspector\nat the lodge was being bribed to approve tubercular cows for slaughter;\nanimals were killed, unsightly lesionish organs discarded and then\nconsumed by baboons. Most of the Garbage Dump troop died, as did all\nmy males who raided the dump.47\nThis was kinda upsetting to me; I habituated a new troop at the other\nend of the park and wouldn’t go anywhere near the remnants of my troop\nfor half a dozen years. Finally, my soon-to-be wife visiting Kenya for the\nfemale-to-male ratio instead of the typical 1:1, and if the males\nremaining were particularly unaggressive and affiliative.48\nThey stayed close together, sat in contact, and groomed more than\naverage. Levels of aggression were lower, and in an informative way.\nMales still had a dominance hierarchy; number three would still fight\nwith numbers four and two, defending his status and seeking a\npromotion. But there was minimal displacement aggression onto\ninnocent bystanders—when number three lost a fight, he’d rarely\nterrorize number ten or a female. Stress hormone levels were low; the\nneurochemistry of anxiety and benzodiazepines worked differently in\nthese individuals.\nHere’s a measure of it, a picture\nthat, if you’re a baboon-ologist, is\nmore surprising than one showing\nbaboons inventing the wheel—two\nadult males grooming. That hardly\never happens. Except in this troop.\nAnd now the most important\npart. Female baboons remain in\ntheir birth troop, whereas males get\nitchy around puberty and leave,\ntrying their luck anywhere from the\ntroop next door to one thirty miles\naway. By the time I returned to this troop, most of the males who had\navoided the TB had died; the troop was filled with males who had\ntransferred in after the TB. In other words, adolescent males had grown\nup in typical baboon troops and then joined this one and adopted the\nstyle of low aggression and high affiliation. The troop’s social culture\nwas being transmitted.\nHow? Adolescents who joined the troop were no less aggressive or\ndisplacing than those joining other troops—there wasn’t self-selection.\nThere was no evidence of social instruction occurring. Instead the most\nlikely explanation involved resident females. These were probably the\nleast stressed female baboons on earth, not being subject to typical male\nto weeks. Coupled with the lack of displacement aggression from\nresident males, this caused the new-transfer males to gradually change,\nassimilating into the troop culture in about six months. Thus, when\ntreated in a less aggressive, more affiliative manner, adolescent baboons\nstart doing the same.\nIn 1965 a rising star of primatology, Irven DeVore of Harvard,\npublished the first overview of the subject.49 Discussing his own\nspecialty, savanna baboons, he wrote that they “have acquired an\naggressive temperament as a defense against predators, and\naggressiveness cannot be turned on and off like a faucet. It is an integral\npart of the monkeys’ personalities, so deeply rooted that it makes them\npotential aggressors in every situation.” Thus savanna baboons became,\nliterally, textbook examples of an aggressive, stratified, male-dominated\nprimate. Yet as we see here, this picture is not universal or inevitable.\nHumans have formed both small nomadic bands and megastates and\nhave demonstrated a flexibility whereby uprooted descendants of the\nformer function in the latter. Human mating patterns are atypically\nflexible, and our societies feature monogamy, polygyny, or polyandry.\nWe have fashioned religions where certain types of violence earn you\nparadise and others where the same violence consigns you to hell.\nBasically, if baboons unexpectedly show this much social plasticity, so\ncan we. Anyone who says that our worst behaviors are inevitable knows\ntoo little about primates, including us.\nOne Person\nSomewhere between neurons, hormones, and genes on one hand and\nculture, ecological influences, and evolution on the other, sits the\nindividual. And with more than seven billion of us, it’s easy to feel that\nno single individual can make much of a difference.\nBut we know that’s not true. There’s the obligatory list of those who\nchanged everything—Mandela, Gandhi, MLK, Rosa Parks, Lincoln,\nAung San Suu Kyi. Yes, they often had scads of advisers. But they were\nthe catalysts, the ones who paid with their freedom or their lives. And\nBut there are also lesser-known people, acting alone or in small\nnumbers, with extraordinary impact. Take Mohamed Bouazizi, a twenty-\nsix-year-old fruit seller in Tunisia, then in its twenty-third year of corrupt\nand repressive rule by a dictator. At the market the police hassled\nBouazizi about an imaginary permit, expecting a bribe. He refused, not\nout of principle—he’d often bribed—but because he lacked the money.\nHe was kicked and spat upon, his fruit cart overturned. His complaint at\nthe government office was ignored. And within an hour of being preyed\nupon by the police, on December 10, 2010, Bouazizi stood in front of\nthat office, doused himself with gasoline, shouted, “How do you expect\nme to make a living?” and set himself on fire.\nBouazizi’s immolation and death triggered protests in Tunisia against\nthe leader, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, against his ruling party, against the\npolice. The protests grew, and within a month the government and Ben\nAli were overthrown. Bouazizi’s act led to protests in Egypt, toppling\nHosni Mubarak’s thirty-year dictatorship. Likewise in Yemen, ending Ali\nAbdullah Saleh’s thirty-four-year rule. And in Libya, leading to the\noverthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi after forty-three years in\npower. And in Syria, where protests morphed into civil war. And in\nJordan, Oman, and Kuwait, leading to the resignations of their prime\nministers. And in Algeria, Iraq, Bahrain, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia,\nproducing semblances of governmental reform. The Arab Spring.\nBouazizi wasn’t thinking about political reform in the Muslim world\nwhen he lit the match; instead there was rage with nowhere to go but\ninward. Make what you will of the Arab Spring’s brief hopefulness,\nfollowed by new strongmen, violence, refugees, and the catastrophe of\nSyria and ISIS. And perhaps history makes the self-immolator as much\nas the self-immolator makes history—regional discontent had long been\ncommemoration was being held at the Pearl Harbor Memorial on the\nanniversary of the attack. A group of survivors who had gathered were\napproached by an elderly man. This was his third trip to the memorial,\ntrying to work up his nerve. He approached the survivors and, in halting\nEnglish, apologized.50\nThe man, Zenji Abe, was a fighter pilot in the 1937 Japanese\ninvasion of China and throughout the Pacific during World War II—\nincluding helping to lead the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nLittle in his earlier life predicted Abe’s apologizing as an old man.\nHis inculcation into war started early, when he joined a military academy\nas a seventh grader. His experience of war was detached—he never\nkilled an American soldier at close quarters. The Pearl Harbor attack felt\nlike a training exercise. His sense of responsibility could readily have\nbeen blunted, as the bomb he dropped hadn’t detonated. And his country\nhad been defeated.\nSome things favored Abe’s gesture. He had been captured and spent\nSome larger factors favored his gesture as well. Japanese/American\nrelations had transformed. And Americans were not traditional enemies.\nThe racial, cultural, and geographic distance might have facilitated\npseudospeciation of Americans, but it was nouveau pseudospeciation,\ncontrasting with centuries of hatred of a nearby enemy—Abe never went\nto China to apologize for the Rape of Nanking. As we know, Thems\ncome in different categories.\nSo these likelihoods and unlikelihoods converged, and Abe stood\nthere, along with nine other pilots who had flown that day, apologizing.\nSome survivors refused the overture. Most accepted it. Abe and other\npilots made subsequent trips to Pearl Harbor and had multiday meetings\nwith American survivors; reconciliative handshakes were broadcast on\nthe Today show for the fiftieth anniversary. Survivors generally\nconsidered the pilots to have just been following orders and found their\ncurrent actions brave and admirable. Abe became close with one\nsurvivor, Richard Fiske, a docent at the memorial. Fiske had been on one\nof the ships during the attack, lost many friends among the 2,390\nAmericans killed, fought at Iwo Jima, described himself as so hating the\nJapanese that he developed a bleeding ulcer. For reasons he never fully\nunderstood, Fiske was the first to accept Abe’s gesture. Other Japanese\nThe process was rich in symbols, starting with an apology that, as\nwe’ve seen, changes nothing and everything. Abe gave Fiske money so\nthat, for the rest of his life, Fiske placed flowers monthly at the\nmemorial. Fiske, a bugler, took to playing not only taps at the memorial,\nbut the Japanese equivalent as well. Some semblance of Us-ness had\nemerged that included everyone there that infamous day.\nPerhaps most important, Abe’s singular act isn’t singular. There are\nnow travel agencies specializing in serving American Vietnam War vets\nreturning to Vietnam for reconciliation ceremonies with ex–Viet Cong.\nVeterans have spearheaded organizations such as Friends of Danang,\ndoing service projects in Vietnam, building schools, clinics, and literal\nbridges.51\nThis picture segues into another extraordinary act. Arguably the\nsingle most shocking event of the Vietnam War, an atrocity that finally\nshook America’s self-perception as a force of good, was the My Lai\nMassacre.\nOn March 16, 1968, a company of American soldiers, under the\ncommand of Lieutenant William Calley Jr., attacked the unarmed\ncommon interpretation, one that we readily recognize by now, is that\nthey had a fierce, vengeful desire to connect faces to this faceless enemy.\nThe official rationale was that the village harbored Viet Cong fighters\nand civilian sympathizers; there is minimal evidence to support this.\nSome of the participants reported being instructed to kill only Viet Cong\nfighters; others that they should kill everyone, burn houses, kill\nlivestock, and destroy wells.\nRegardless of these conflicting reports, the rest, as they say, is\nagonizing history. Between 350 and 500 unarmed civilians, including\ninfants and elderly people, were killed. Bodies were mutilated and\ndumped down wells, huts and fields set ablaze, numerous women gang-\nraped before being killed. Calley was described to have personally shot\nchildren under their mothers who had died sheltering them. The\nAmericans encountered no enemy fire, found no military-aged men. It\nwas destruction of biblical proportions, or Roman proportions, or\nCrusader, or Viking, or . . . This destruction was photographed. The\nhorror is worsened because My Lai was not a solitary atrocity, and the\ngovernment labored to conceal events and slapped Calley on the wrist,\nsentencing him to three years of house arrest.\nThere was by no means universal participation by Americans\n(ultimately twenty-six soldiers were criminally charged, with Calley the\nonly one convicted; “just following orders” was the order of the day).*53\nIndividual thresholds varied. One soldier killed a mother and child and\nthen refused to do more. Another helped herd civilians together but\nrefused to fire. Some refused orders outright, even in the face of threats\nof court-martial or being shot. One, PFC Michael Bernhardt, refused and\nAnd three men halted the killings. Predictably, they were outsiders.\nThe catalyst was Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr., age twenty-five,\nwho was flying a helicopter, along with two crew members, Glenn\nAndreotta and Lawrence Colburn. Perhaps pertinent to what occurred\nwas the fact that Thompson descended from Native American survivors\nof the Trail of Tears death march; his religious parents raised him, in the\n1950s in rural Georgia, to oppose segregation. Colburn and Andreotta\nwere observant Catholics.\nThompson and his crew had flown over the village, intending to aid\nthe infantry fighting Viet Cong. Instead of evidence of a battle, they saw\nmasses of dead civilians. Thompson initially thought that the village was\nunder attack, with Americans protecting villagers, but couldn’t figure out\nwhere the attack was coming from. He landed the copter amid the chaos\nand saw one soldier, Sergeant David Mitchell, firing into a mass of\ninjured, wailing civilians in a ditch and another, Captain Ernest Medina,\nshoot a woman point-blank; Thompson realized who was doing the\nattacking. He confronted Calley, who was higher ranking than him and\ntold him to mind his damn business.\nThompson saw a group of women, children, and elderly men\nhuddling by a bunker with American soldiers approaching them,\npreparing to attack. Discussing what happened next, more than twenty\nyears later, he described his feelings about those soldiers: “It’s—they\nlanded his helicopter between the villagers and the soldiers, trained his\nmachine guns on his fellow Americans, and ordered his crew to mow\nthem down if they attempted to further harm the villagers.*,*\nLeft: Glenn Andreotta; Right, right to left: Hugh Thompson, Lawrence Colburn,\nand Do Hoa, who they rescued from the ditch as a child, My Lai village, 1998\nThus we have one person impulsively changing history in twenty\ncountries, another who overcame decades of hatred to catalyze\nreconciliation, others who overcame every reflex of their training to do\nthe right thing. Time for one last singular person, one who inspires me\nenormously.\nThe person was the Anglican cleric John Newton, born in 1725.54\nWell, that doesn’t sound too exciting. He’s best known for composing the\nhymn “Amazing Grace.” Oh, cool; that, along with Leonard Cohen’s\n“Hallelujah,” always move me. Newton also was an abolitionist, a\nmentor to William Wilberforce in his parliamentary battle to outlaw\nslavery in the British Empire. Okay, getting better. Now get this—as a\nyoung man, Newton had captained a slave ship. Bingo, that’s the setup—\na man overseeing and profiting from slavery, a flash of religious and\nNothing resembling this occurred.\nNewton, the son of a ship captain, goes to sea with his father at age\neleven. At eighteen he is pressed into service in the navy, tries to desert,\nand is flogged. Newton manages to escape and works on a West African\nslave ship. Get ready for him to see the similarity between the captivity\nof these people and his own experience, to have a revelation.\nNo such thing occurs.\nHe works on the slave ship and is apparently so detested by everyone\nthat they dump him in what is now Sierra Leone with a slaver who gives\nhim to his wife as a slave. He’s rescued; the ship he is on, returning to\nEngland, is caught in a horrific storm and starts to sink. Newton calls out\nto God, the ship doesn’t sink, and he has a spiritual conversion to\nevangelical Christianity. He signs up to work on another slave ship. Get\nready now—he’s found God, has just been a slave himself, and is poised\nto suddenly recognize the horror that was the slave trade.\nNope.\nHe professes some sympathy for slaves, grows deeper into his\nevangelical conversion. He eventually becomes captain of a slave ship\nand works another six years before stopping. At last he’s seen his actions\nfor what they are.\nNot that either.\nIt’s because his health was declining from those tough voyages. He\nworks as a tax collector, studies theology, applies to become an Anglican\npriest. And he invests his money in slave-trading ventures. In the\nparlance of my native Brooklyn, from when it was not yet trendy, can\nyou believe this fuggin’ guy?\nHe becomes a popular preacher, known for his sermons and pastoral\nconcern; he composes hymns, speaks out for the poor and downtrodden.\nPresumably, somewhere along the way he stops investing in slavery;\nmaybe because of his conscience, maybe because better investments\ncome along. Still, not a word about slavery. Finally he publishes a\npamphlet denouncing it, thirty-four years after stopping being a slaver.\nThat’s a lot of time spent as a blind wretch. Newton’s is a rare voice\namong abolitionists, someone who has witnessed those horrors, let alone\nconfronting difficult things. Maybe, at best, I would have been one of the\nsoldiers standing in confusion, compelled by the inhibitions that\nGrossman discusses into repeatedly checking my rifle to make sure it\nwas loaded, rather than firing it. I see little indication that as an old man I\nwill achieve the grace and moral stature of a Zenji Abe or a Richard\nFiske. Bouazizi’s act is incomprehensible to me.\nBut Newton, Newton is different; Newton is familiar. He takes\nconvenient comfort from the Bible’s embrace of slavery, spends decades\nresisting the possibility of his personal morality moving past its\nconventions. He shows great empathy but applies it selectively. He\nexpands his circle of who counts as an Us, but only so far. We saw how\nthe person who emerges from the crowd to run into the burning building\ntypically acts before thinking, displaying an ingrained automaticity of\ndoing the harder, better thing. There’s no automaticity with Newton. We\ncan practically see his dlPFC laboring with all that rationalizing\n—“There’s nothing I can do,” “It’s too big for one person to challenge,”\n“Better to be concerned about the needy who are close to home,” “I can\nuse the profits from the investments for good works,” “Those people\nreally are so fundamentally different,” “I’m tired.” Yes, journeys begin\nwith a single step, but with Newton it’s ten steps forward, nine self-\nserving ones back. Thompson’s moment of moral perfection feels as\nunattainable to me as aspiring to be a gazelle or a waterfall or an\nincandescent sunset. But there’s hope for us, with our foibles and\n661\n\ntransported far more people than that.\nFinally—the Potential for Collective Power\nThere is an anecdote from the Peninsular War of 1807–14, told by\nMajor General George Bell, then an ensign: There was a bridge\nseparating the opposing British and French, with a sentry posted by each\nside to sound an alarm should the enemy rush across the bridge.55 A\nBritish officer was making rounds and found the British sentry there in\nan unlikely situation—carrying British and French muskets, one on each\nshoulder, seemingly guarding the bridge for the two opposing armies,\nwith no French sentry in sight. His explanation? His French counterpart\nhad snuck off to buy some liquor for them to share and, naturally, he was\nwatching the other guy’s gun.\nFraternizing between enemy soldiers is remarkably frequent in war.\nIt’s most common when they’re the same race and major religion and\nwhen they are enlisted men rather than officers. It’s also more common\nwhen individual enemies, rather than groups, encounter each other, when\nit’s the same person day after day (e.g., guarding the bridge opposite\nyou), when someone could have shot you but didn’t. Fraternizing rarely\ninvolves discussions about life, death, and geopolitics; instead it’s things\nlike bartering food (since the other side’s rations can’t be as bad as\nlookout for officers. In the Crimean War there was regular bartering\nacross enemy lines of Russian vodka for French baguettes. One British\nsoldier in the Peninsular War described how in the evenings, British and\nFrench troops played cards around campfires. And in the American Civil\nWar, Yankee and Rebel soldiers would fraternize, barter, trade\nnewspapers, and, with piercing poignancy, hold joint baptismal services\nthe evening before a battle that would clearly be a bloodbath.\nThus enemy soldiers have frequently found common ground. A little\nover a hundred years ago, two such events occurred on a stunning scale.\nIt must be admitted that some good came of World War I—thanks to\nthe subsequent collapse of three empires, people in the Baltic, the\nBalkans, and Eastern Europe gained independence. But from anyone\nelse’s perspective, it was a pointless slaughter of fifteen million people.\nThe war to end all wars, leading to the ruinous peace to end all peace,\nturned out to be just another of centuries of examples of Europe\ndevouring its young with meaningless conflict. But amid the quagmire of\nWorld War I came two examples of hope that, for want of a better word,\nseem almost miraculous.\nGerman and British soldiers posing together\nThings spread from there. As extensively documented, soldiers on\nboth sides loaned each other shovels for digging graves. And then helped\nout. And then held joint burial services. Which led to exchanges of food,\ndrink, and tobacco. Eventually, unarmed soldiers swarmed into no-\nman’s-land, prayed and caroled together, shared dinner, exchanged gifts.\nEnemy combatants took group portraits; buttons and helmets were\nexchanged as souvenirs; plans were made to meet when the war was\nover. Most famously, soccer matches were held with improvised balls,\nwith scores rarely kept.57\nOne historian records a chilling anecdote concerning a German\nsoldier writing home about the truce, mentioning that not everyone\nparticipated—there was one soldier who condemned the others as\ntraitors, an obscure corporal named . . . Hitler. But for most of the five\nhundred miles of trenches, the truce held through Christmas, and often\neven New Year’s. It took officers’ threats of court-martial to get\neveryone back to fighting, soldiers wishing their counterparts a safe war.\nStunning, moving, heartbreaking. And with only sporadic exceptions, it\nnever happened again, as even brief Christmas truces to retrieve the dead\nled to court-martials.\nWhy did the 1914 truce work? The unique static nature of trench\nwarfare meant that soldiers faced each other day after day. This\nprompted often-friendly taunting across the lines in the period preceding\nChristmas, establishing a vague sense of connection. Moreover, the\nrepeated interactions produced a “shadow of the future”—betray the\ntruce, and expect no-holds-barred revenge.\nThe success was also aided by everyone sharing the same Judeo-\nChristian tradition and Western European culture; many knew the others’\nlanguage, had visited the others’ country. They were of the same race,\nand pejoratively calling the enemy “Fritz” completely differs from the\npseudospeciation of the Vietnam War’s “gooks,” “slants,” and “dinks.”\nAdditional factors explain why the truce mostly involved British and\nGerman troops. While the French fought passionately on their own soil,\nBrits had no particular animosity toward Germans and typically\nperceived themselves as fighting to save les derrières of the French, their\nthey should both be fighting the Prussians, the resented dominating\ngroup in Germany.\nAnd perhaps most important, the truce was aided by top-down\napproval. Officers typically negotiated; figures such as the pope called\nfor a truce; it was a holiday that stood for peace and good will toward all\nmen.\nThus we have the Christmas Truce. Remarkably, something even\nmore miraculous occurred during the war. In what has been termed the\nLive and Let Live phenomenon, soldiers in the trenches repeatedly\nevolved stable truces without exchanging a word, without a shared\nreligious holiday, without the sanction of officers and leaders.\nHow did this occur? As documented by the historian Tony Ashworth\nin Trench Warfare: 1914–1918, it would begin passively. Troops on both\nsides ate around the same time, and guns would go silent then—who\nwants to interrupt dinner in order to kill someone or be killed? The same\nwould occur during awful weather, when everyone’s priority became\nflooded trenches or avoiding freezing to death.58\nMutual restraint also emerged in circumstances shadowed by the\nfuture. Wagon trains delivering food were easy artillery targets but were\nleft unharmed, to prevent reciprocal shelling. Similarly, latrines were\nspared.\nThese truces emerged when soldiers chose not to do something. But\ntruces were also established by overt action. How? Have your best sniper\nput a bullet into the wall of an abandoned house near enemy lines. Then\nhave him do it again and again, repeatedly hitting the same spot. What\nare you communicating? “Look how good our guy is. He could have\naimed at you instead but chose not to. What are you going to do about\nit?” And the other side would reciprocate with their best sniper. An\nagreement to shoot over each other’s heads had been established.\nThe key was ritualization—shooting repeatedly at the same\ninconsequential target, renewing the commitment to peace daily at the\nsame time.\nLive and Let Live truces could withstand perturbations. Soldiers\nsignaled the other side that they had to shoot for real for a while—\nwhere Germans unexpectedly fired a shell into British trenches. Soon a\nGerman shouted, “We are very sorry about that; we hope no one was\nhurt. It is not our fault, it is that damned Prussian artillery.” And back\nflew two British shells.)\nLive and Let Live truces emerged repeatedly. And repeatedly brass in\nthe rear would intervene, rotating troops, threatening court-martials,\nordering savage raids requiring hand-to-hand combat that would shatter\nany sense of shared interests between enemies.\nWe see the evolution—initial low-cost overtures with immediate\nbenefits, such as not shooting during dinner, transitioning through\ngradations of increasingly elaborate restraint and signaling. And we\nrecognize the modified Tit for Tat in dealing with truce violations, with\nits propensity toward cooperation, punishment for violations,\nmechanisms for forgiveness, and clear rules.\nSo, hooray, just like social bacteria, we can evolve cooperation. But\none thing that a cooperative bacterium lacks is a psyche. Ashworth\nthoughtfully explored the psychology of how Live and Let Live\nparticipants began to view the enemy.\nHe described a sequence of steps. First, once any mutual restraint\nemerged, the enemy had established that they were rational, with\nincentives to hold fire. This prompted a sense of responsibility in dealing\nwith them; this was initially purely self-serving—don’t violate an\nagreement because they’ll violate back. With time, the responsibility\ndeveloped a moral tinge, tapping into most people’s resistance to\nbetraying someone who deals reliably with them. The specific\nmotivations for truces generated insights—“Hey, they don’t want dinner\ndisturbed any more than we do; they don’t want to fight in this rain\neither; they also deal with officers who screw up everything.” There’d be\na creeping sense of camaraderie.\nThis produced something striking. The war machines in combatant\ncountries spewed the usual pseudospeciating propaganda. But in\nstudying soldiers’ diaries and letters, Ashworth observed minimal\nhostility toward the enemy expressed by trench soldiers; the further from\nthe front, the more hostility. In the words of one frontline soldier, quoted\nUs and Them would be in flux. If someone is shooting at you or your\nband of brothers, they are certainly a Them. But otherwise Them was\nmore likely to be the rats and lice, the mold in the food, the cold. As well\nas any comfortable officer at headquarters who would be—in the words\nof another trench soldier—“[an] abstract tactician who from far away\ndisposes of us.”\nAmerican and German propaganda posters\nThese truces could not persist; the final phases of the war obliterated\nthem, as the British High Command adopted a nightmarish strategy of\nwar by attrition.\nIn thinking of the Christmas Truce and the Live and Let Live system,\nI always have the same fantasy, a very different one from the fantasy that\nbegan this book. What would have happened if there had been two\nadditional inventions during World War I? The first is modern mass\ncommunications—texting, Twitter, Facebook. The second is a mind-set\nthat emerged only among World War I’s shattered survivors—the\ncynicism of modernity. Men up and down hundreds of miles of trenches\nrepeatedly reinvented Live and Let Live, unaware that they were not\nalone. Imagine texts bouncing along and across the trenches, a million\ncould have gone home to kiss their loved ones and then face the real\nenemy, the bloated aristocracy who would sacrifice them for their own\npower.\n—\nIt is easy to have this fantasy about the Great War, a distant museum\npiece festooned with twirly mustaches and silly plumed officers’\nhelmets. It behooves us to step back from the grainy black-and-white\nphotos and to consider a hugely difficult thought experiment. Our\ncontemporary adversaries kidnap girls and sell them into slavery, commit\natrocities and, instead of concealing them, display the evidence online.\nWhen I read the news of the things they’ve done, I hate them\npassionately. It’s impossible to imagine kicking back, having a group\nsing-along of “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” and exchanging\nChristmas tchotchkes with Al-Qaeda grunts.\nYet time does interesting things. The hatred between Americans and\nJapanese during World War II was boundless. American recruiting\nposters advertised “Jap Hunting Licenses”; one veteran of the Pacific\ntheater described a common event, writing in the Atlantic in 1946:\n[American soldiers] “boiled the flesh off enemy skulls to make table\nornaments for sweethearts, or carved their bones into letter openers.”59\nAnd there’s the bestial treatment of American POWs by the Japanese. If\nRichard Fiske had wound up a POW, Zenji Abe might have helped\nmarch him to death; if the former had killed the latter in battle, he might\nhave made a souvenir of his skull. And instead, more than fifty years\nlater, one would write a letter of condolence to the other’s grandchildren\nupon the death of Grandpa.\n—\nA key point of the previous chapter was that those in the future will look\nback on us and be appalled at what we did amid our scientific ignorance.\nA key challenge in this chapter is to recognize how likely we are to\neventually look back at our current hatreds and find them mysterious.\nDaniel Dennett has pondered a scenario of someone undergoing\nsimilarities between Us and Them would outweigh the differences? And\nthat a hundred years ago, in a place that was hell on earth, those with the\nmost temptation to hate often didn’t even need the passage of time for\nthat to happen?\nThe philosopher George Santayana provided us with an aphorism so\n670\nthis final chapter, we must turn Santayana on his head—those who do\nnot remember the extraordinary truces of the World War I trenches, or\nwho do not learn of Thompson, Colburn, and Andreotta, or of the\nreconciliative distances traveled by Abe and Fiske, Mandela and Viljoen,\nHussein and Rabin, or of the stumbling, familiar moral frailties that\nNewton vanquished, or who do not recognize that science can teach us\nhow to make events like these more likely—those who do not remember\nthese are condemned to be less likely to repeat these reasons to hope."

    "content": "e’ve covered lots of ground, and some themes have arisen\nrepeatedly. It’s worth reviewing them before considering two\nfinal points.\nAs the single most important of them, virtually every scientific fact\npresented in this book concerns the average of what’s being measured.\nThere is always variation, and it’s often the most interesting thing about\na fact. Not every person activates the amygdala when seeing the face of a\nThem; not every yeast adheres to another one bearing the same surface\nprotein marker. Instead, on the average, both do. Reflecting this, I’ve just\ndiscovered that this book contains variations on “average,” “typically,”\n“usually,” “often,” “tend to,” and “generally” more than five hundred\ntimes. And I probably should have inserted them even more as\nreminders. There are individual differences and interesting exceptions\neverywhere you look in science.\nNow, in no particular order:\nIt’s great if your frontal cortex lets you avoid temptation,\nallowing you to do the harder, better thing. But it’s\nusually more effective if doing that better thing has\nbecome so automatic that it isn’t hard. And it’s often\neasiest to avoid temptation with distraction and\nreappraisal rather than willpower.\nWhile it’s cool that there’s so much plasticity in the\nbrain, it’s no surprise—it has to work that way.\nChildhood adversity can scar everything from our DNA\nto our cultures, and effects can be lifelong, even\nmultigenerational. However, more adverse consequences\nweren’t necessarily so in the past; many started with\nnonconforming reasoning.\nRepeatedly, biological factors (e.g., hormones) don’t so\nmuch cause a behavior as modulate and sensitize,\nlowering thresholds for environmental stimuli to cause\nit.\nCognition and affect always interact. What’s interesting\nis when one dominates.\nGenes have different effects in different environments; a\nhormone can make you nicer or crummier, depending on\nyour values; we haven’t evolved to be “selfish” or\n“altruistic” or anything else—we’ve evolved to be\nparticular ways in particular settings. Context, context,\ncontext.\nBiologically, intense love and intense hate aren’t\nopposites. The opposite of each is indifference.\nAdolescence shows us that the most interesting part of\nthe brain evolved to be shaped minimally by genes and\nmaximally by experience; that’s how we learn—context,\ncontext, context.\nArbitrary boundaries on continua can be helpful. But\nnever forget that they are arbitrary.\nOften we’re more about the anticipation and pursuit of\npleasure than about the experience of it.\nYou can’t understand aggression without understanding\nfear (and what the amygdala has to do with both).\nGenes aren’t about inevitabilities; they’re about\npotentials and vulnerabilities. And they don’t determine\nanything on their own. Gene/environment interactions\nare everywhere. Evolution is most consequential when\naltering regulation of genes, rather than genes\nthemselves.\nWe implicitly divide the world into Us and Them, and\nprefer the former. We are easily manipulated, even\nWe’ve evolved to be somewhere in between in these and\nother categories that are clear-cut in other animals. It\nmakes us a much more malleable and resilient species. It\nalso makes our social lives much more confusing and\nmessy, filled with imperfection and wrong turns.\nThe homunculus has no clothes.\nWhile traditional nomadic hunter-gatherer life over\nhundreds of thousands of years might have been a little\non the boring side, it certainly wasn’t ceaselessly\nbloody. In the years since most humans abandoned a\nhunter-gatherer lifestyle, we’ve obviously invented\nmany things. One of the most interesting and\nchallenging is social systems where we can be\nsurrounded by strangers and can act anonymously.\nSaying a biological system works “well” is a value-free\nassessment; it can take discipline, hard work, and\nwillpower to accomplish either something wondrous or\nsomething appalling. “Doing the right thing” is always\ncontext dependent.\nMany of our best moments of morality and compassion\nhave roots far deeper and older than being mere\nproducts of human civilization.\nBe dubious about someone who suggests that other\ntypes of people are like little crawly, infectious things.\nWhen humans invented socioeconomic status, they\ninvented a way to subordinate like nothing that\nhierarchical primates had ever seen before.\n“Me” versus “us” (being prosocial within your group) is\neasier than “us” versus “them” (prosociality between\ngroups).\nIt’s not great if someone believes it’s okay for people to\ndo some horrible, damaging act. But more of the world’s\nmisery arises from people who, of course, oppose that\nhorrible act . . . but cite some particular circumstances\nselves as well.\nNeither the capacity for fancy, rarefied moral reasoning\nnor for feeling great empathy necessarily translates into\nactually doing something difficult, brave, and\ncompassionate.\nPeople kill and are willing to be killed for symbolic\nsacred values. Negotiations can make peace with Them;\nunderstanding and respecting the intensity of their\nsacred values can make lasting peace.\nWe are constantly being shaped by seemingly irrelevant\nstimuli, subliminal information, and internal forces we\ndon’t know a thing about.\nOur worst behaviors, ones we condemn and punish, are\nthe products of our biology. But don’t forget that the\nsame applies to our best behaviors.\nIndividuals no more exceptional than the rest of us\nprovide stunning examples of our finest moments as\nhumans.\nTwo Last Thoughts\nIf you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it\nwould be “It’s complicated.” Nothing seems to cause\nanything; instead everything just modulates something\nelse. Scientists keep saying, “We used to think X, but\nnow we realize that . . .” Fixing one thing often messes\nup ten more, as the law of unintended consequences\nreigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51\npercent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and\n49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually\nit can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something,\ncan make things better. But we have no choice but to try.\nAnd if you are reading this, you are probably ideally\nsuited to do so. You’ve amply proven you have\n675\nfestering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably\ndon’t have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or\nbeing invisible in your world. And you’ve been\neducated. In other words, you’re one of the lucky\nhumans. So try.\nFinally, you don’t have to choose between being\nscientific and being compassionate."

    "content": "Neuroscience 101\nonsider two different scenarios. First:\nThink back to when you hit puberty. You’d been primed by a\nparent or teacher about what to expect. You woke up with a funny\nfeeling, found your jammies alarmingly soiled. You excitedly woke up\nyour parents, who got tearful; they took embarrassing pictures, a sheep\nwas slaughtered in your honor, and you were carried through town in a\nsedan chair while neighbors chanted in an ancient language. This was a\nbig deal.\nBut be honest—would your life be so different if those endocrine\nchanges had instead occurred twenty-four hours later?\nSecond:\nEmerging from a store, you are unexpectedly chased by a lion. As\npart of the stress response, your brain increases your heart rate and blood\npressure, dilates blood vessels in your leg muscles, which are now\nfrantically working, and sharpens sensory processing to produce a tunnel\nvision of concentration.\nHow would things have turned out if your brain took twenty-four\nhours to send those commands? You’d be dead meat.\nThat’s what makes the brain special. Hit puberty tomorrow instead of\ntoday? So what. Make some antibodies tonight instead of now? Rarely\nfatal. Same for delaying depositing calcium in your bones. But much of\nbetween having something and having nothing to say, maximizing\nsignal-to-noise ratios. And this is demanding and expensive.*\nONE NEURON AT A TIME\nhe basic cell type of the nervous system, what we typically call a\n“brain cell,” is the neuron. The hundred billion or so in our brains\ncommunicate with one another, forming complex circuits. In addition,\nthere are glia cells, which do a lot of gofering—providing structural\nsupport and insulation for neurons, storing energy for them, helping to\nmop up neuronal damage.\nNaturally, this neuron/glia comparison is all wrong. There are about\nten glial cells for every neuron, coming in various subtypes. They greatly\ninfluence how neurons speak to one another, and also form glial\nnetworks that communicate completely differently from neurons. So glia\nare important. Nonetheless, to make this primer more manageable, I’m\ngoing to be very neuron-centric.\nPart of what makes the nervous system so\ndistinctive is how distinctive neurons are as cells.\nCells are usually small, self-contained entities—\nconsider little round red blood cells:\nNeurons, in contrast, are highly asymmetrical,\nelongated beasts, typically with processes sticking\nout all over the place:\nThese processes can be elaborated to nutty\nextents. Consider this single neuron, drawn in the\nearly twentieth century by one of the gods in the\nfield, Santiago Ramón y Cajal:\nsingle neurons in the spinal cord that send out projection cables many\nfeet long. There are spinal cord neurons in blue whales that are half the\nlength of a basketball court.\nNow for the subparts of a neuron, the key to understanding its\nfunction.\nWhat neurons do is talk to one another, cause one another to get\nexcited. At one end of a neuron are its metaphorical ears, specialized\nprocesses that receive information from another neuron. At the other end\nare the processes that are the mouth, that communicate with the next\nneuron in line.\nThe ears, the inputs, are called dendrites. The output begins with a\nneuron behind it is excited. The flow of information then sweeps from\nthe dendrites to the cell body to the axon to the axon terminals, and is\nthen passed to the next neuron.\nLet’s translate “flow of information” into quasi chemistry. What\nactually goes from the dendrites to the axon terminals? A wave of\nelectrical excitation. Inside the neuron are various positively and\nnegatively charged ions. Just outside the neuron’s membrane are other\npositively and negatively charged ions. When a neuron has gotten an\nexciting signal from the previous neuron at the end of one single\ndendritic fiber, channels in the membrane in that dendrite open, allowing\nvarious ions to flow in and others to flow out, and the net result is that\nthe inside of the end of that dendrite becomes more positively charged.\nThe charge spreads toward the axon terminal, where it is passed to the\nnext neuron. That’s it for the chemistry.\nTwo gigantically important details:\nThe resting potential. So when a neuron has gotten a hugely excitatory\nneuron has nothing to say, has not been stimulated? Maybe a state of\nequilibrium, where the inside and outside have equal, neutral charges?*\nNo, never! That’s good enough for some cell in your spleen or your big\ntoe. But back to that critical issue, that neurons are all about contrasts.\nWhen a neuron has nothing to say, that isn’t some passive state of things\njust trickling down to zero. Instead it’s an active process. An active,\nintentional, forceful, muscular, sweaty process. Instead of the “I have\nnothing to say” state being one of charge neutrality, the inside of the\nneuron is negatively charged relative to the outside.\nYou couldn’t ask for a more dramatic contrast: I have nothing to say\n= inside of the neuron is negatively charged. I have something to say =\ninside is positive. No neuron ever confuses the two. The internally\nnegative state is called the “resting potential.” The excited state is called\nthe “action potential.” And why is generating this dramatic resting\npotential such an active process? Because neurons have to work like\ncrazy, using various pumps in their membranes, to push some positively\ncharged ions out and to keep some negatively charged ones in, all in\norder to generate that negative internal resting state. Along comes an\nexcitatory signal; the pumps stop working, channels open, and ions rush\nthis way and that to generate the excitatory positive internal charge. And\nwhen that wave of excitation has passed, the channels close and the\npumps go back into action, regenerating that negative resting potential.\nRemarkably, neurons spend nearly half their energy on the pumps that\ngenerate the resting potential. It doesn’t come cheap to generate dramatic\ncontrasts between having nothing to say and having some exciting news.\nNow that we understand resting potentials and action potentials, on\nto the other gigantically important detail:\nThat’s not what action potentials really are. What I’ve just outlined is that a\nsingle dendritic fibril receives an excitatory signal from the previous\nneuron (i.e., the previous neuron has had an action potential); this\ngenerates an action potential in that dendrite, which propagates toward\nthe cell body, over it, on to the axon, to the axon terminals, and signals\nthe next neuron in line. Not true. Instead:\nSo the neuron is sitting there with nothing to say, which is to say that\nenough to make the entire inside of the neuron positively charged,\nsimply a little less negatively charged just inside that dendrite (just to\nattach some numbers here that don’t matter in the slightest, the resting\npotential charge shifts from around –70 millivolts to around –60\nmillivolts). Then the channels close. That little hiccup of becoming less\nnegative* spreads farther up the shaft of that dendrite. The pumps have\nstarted working, pumping ions back to where they were in the first place.\nSo at the end of that dendritic fibril, the charge went from –70 to –60\nmV. But a little bit up the shaft of that fibril, things then go from –70 to –\n65 mV. Farther up the shaft, –70 to –69. In other words, that excitatory\nsignal dissipates. You’ve taken a nice smooth calm lake, in its resting\nstate, and tossed a little pebble in. It causes a bit of a ripple right there,\nwhich spreads outward, getting smaller in its magnitude, until it\ndissipates not far from where the pebble hit. And miles away, at the\nlake’s axonal end, that ripple of excitation has had no effect whatsoever.\nIn other words, if a single dendritic fibril is excited, that’s not enough\nto pass on the excitation down to the axonal end and on to the next\nneuron. How does a message ever get passed on? Back to that wonderful\ndrawing of a neuron by Cajal here.\nThat arborized array of bifurcating dendritic branches ends in lots of\nends of fibrils (time to introduce the term commonly used: “ends in lots\nof dendritic spines”). And in order to get sufficient excitation to sweep\nfrom the dendritic end of the neuron to the axonal end, you have to have\nsummation—the same spine must be stimulated repeatedly and/or, more\ncommonly, a bunch of the spinal neurons must be stimulated at once.\nYou can’t get a wave, rather than just a ripple, unless you throw in a lot\nof pebbles.\nAt the base of the axon, where it emerges from the cell body, is a\nspecialized part (called the axon “hillock”). If all those summated\ndendritic inputs produce enough of a ripple to move the resting potential\naround the hillock from –70 mV to around –40 mV, a threshold is\npassed. And once that happens, all hell breaks loose. A different class of\nchannels opens in the membrane of the hillock, which allows a massive\nmigration of ions, producing, finally, a positive charge (about 30 mV). In\nFrom an informational standpoint, a neuron has two different types\nof signaling systems. From the dendritic spines to the starts of the axon\nhillock, it’s an analogue signal, with gradations of signals that dissipate\nover space and time. And from the axon hillock to the axon terminals,\nit’s a digital system with all-or-none signaling that regenerates down the\nlength of the axon.\nLet’s throw in some imaginary numbers. Suppose an average neuron\nhas about one hundred dendritic spines and about one hundred axon\nterminals. What are the implications of this in the context of the\nanalogue/digital feature of neurons?\nSometimes nothing interesting. Consider neuron A, which, as just\nintroduced, has one hundred axon terminals. Each one of those connects\nto one of the dendritic spines of the next neuron in line, neuron B.\nNeuron A has an action potential, which propagates down to all of its\none hundred axon terminals, which excites all one hundred dendritic\nspines in neuron B. The threshold at the axon hillock of neuron B\nrequires fifty of the dendrites to get excited around the same time in\norder to generate an action potential; thus, with all one hundred of the\ndendrites firing, neuron B is guaranteed to get an action potential.\nNow, instead, neuron A projects half of its axon terminals to neuron\nB and half to neuron C. It has an action potential; does that guarantee\none in neurons B and C? Yes. Each of those neurons’ axon hillocks has\nthat threshold of needing a signal from fifty dendritic pebbles at once in\norder to have an action potential.\nNow, instead, neuron A evenly distributes its axon terminals among\nten different target neurons, neurons B through K. Is its action potential\ngoing to produce action potentials in the target neurons? No way—\ncontinuing our example, the ten dendritic spines’ worth of pebbles in\neach target neuron is way below the threshold of fifty pebbles.\nSo what will ever cause an action potential in, say, neuron K, which\nhas only ten of its dendritic spines getting excitatory signals from neuron\nA? Well, what’s going on with its other ninety dendritic spines? They’re\ngetting inputs from other neurons—nine of them, with ten inputs from\neach. When will neuron B have an action potential? When at least half of\nneurons it projects to, the smaller its average influence will be at each of\nthose target neurons. There’s a trade-off.\nThis doesn’t matter in the spinal cord, where one neuron typically\nsends all its projections to the next one in line. But in the brain one\nneuron will disperse its projections to scads of other ones and receive\nsignaling.\n—\nNow to put in a flabbergasting real number—your average neuron has\nabout ten thousand dendritic spines and about the same number of axon\nterminals. Factor in a hundred billion neurons, and you see why brains,\nrather than kidneys, write poetry.\nJust for completeness, here are a couple of final facts. Neurons have\nsome additional tricks, at the end of an action potential, to enhance the\ncontrast between nothing to say/something to say even more, two means\nof ending the action potential really fast and dramatically: something\ncalled delayed rectification and another thing called the hyperpolarized\nrefractory period. Another minor detail from that diagram above—a type\nof glial cell wraps around an axon, forming a layer of insulation called a\nmyelin sheath; this “myelination” causes the action potential to shoot\ndown the axon faster.\nAnd one final detail of great future importance: the threshold of the\naxon hillock can change over time, thus changing the neuron’s\nexcitability. What things change thresholds? Hormones, nutritional state,\nexperience, and other factors filling this book’s pages.\nWe’ve now made it from one end of a neuron to the other. How\nexactly does a neuron with an action potential communicate its excitation\nto the next neuron in line?\nTWO NEURONS AT A TIME: SYNAPTIC\nCOMMUNICATION\no an action potential has been triggered at the hillock in neuron A\nand has swept down to all ten thousand axon terminals. How is this\nnumbers of separate neurons that slowly grow their dendritic and axonal\nprocesses. And eventually the axon terminals of one neuron reach and\ntouch the dendritic spines of the next neuron(s), and they merge, forming\na continuous membrane between the two cells. From all those separate\nfetal neurons, the mature brain forms this continuous, vastly complex net\nof one single superneuron, which was called a “synctitium.” Thus\nexcitation readily flows from one neuron to the next because they aren’t\nreally separate neurons.\nLate in the nineteenth century an alternative view emerged, namely\nthat each neuron remains an independent unit, and that the axon\nterminals of one neuron don’t actually touch the dendritic spines of the\nnext. Instead there’s a tiny gap between the two. This notion was called\nthe “neuron doctrine.”\nThe adherents of the synctitium school thought that the neuron\ndoctrine was asinine. “Show me the gaps between axon terminals and\ndendritic spines,” they demanded of these heretics, “and tell me how\nexcitation jumps from one neuron to the next.”\nAnd then in 1873 it all got solved by the Italian neuroscientist\nCamillo Golgi, who invented a technique for staining brain tissue in a\nnovel fashion. And the aforementioned Cajal used this “Golgi stain” to\nstain all the processes, all the branches and branchlets and twigs of the\ndendrites and axon terminals of single neurons. Crucially, the stain didn’t\nspread from one neuron to the next. There wasn’t a continuous, merged\nnet of a single superneuron. Individual neurons are discrete entities. The\nneuron doctrine-ers vanquished the synctitium-ites.*\nHooray, case closed; there are indeed micro-microscopic gaps\nbetween axon terminals and dendritic spines; these gaps are called\n“synapses” (which weren’t directly visualized, putting the last nail in the\nsynctitial coffin, until the invention of electron microscopy in the 1950s).\nBut there’s still that problem of how excitation propagates from one\nneuron to the next, leaping across the synapse.\nThe answer, whose pursuit dominated neuroscience in the middle\nhalf of the twentieth century, is that the electrical excitation doesn’t leap\nballoons called vesicles, filled with many copies of a chemical\nmessenger. Along comes the action potential that initiated miles away in\nthat neuron’s axon hillock. It sweeps over the terminal and triggers the\nrelease of those chemical messengers into the synapse. Which they float\nacross, reaching the dendritic spine on the other side, where they excite\nthe neuron. These chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters.\nHow do neurotransmitters, released from the “presynaptic” side of\nthe synapse, cause excitation in the “postsynaptic” dendritic spine?\nSitting on the membrane of the spine are receptors for the\nneurotransmitter. Time to introduce one of the great clichés of biology.\nThe neurotransmitter molecule has a distinctive shape (with each copy of\nthe molecule having the same). The receptor has a binding pocket of a\ndistinctive shape that is perfectly complementary to the shape of the\nneurotransmitter. And thus the neurotransmitter—cliché time—fits into\nthe receptor like a key into a lock. No other molecule fits snugly into that\nreceptor; the neurotransmitter molecule won’t fit snugly into any other\ntype of receptor. Neurotransmitter binds to receptor, which triggers those\nchannels to open, and the currents of ionic excitation begin in the\ndendritic spine.\nThis describes “transsynaptic” communication with\nneurotransmitters. Except for one detail: what happens to the\nneurotransmitter molecules after they bind to the receptors? They don’t\nbind forever—remember that action potentials occur on the order of a\nmillisecond. Instead they float off the receptors, at which point the\nneurotransmitters have to be cleaned up. This occurs in one of two ways.\nFirst, for the ecologically minded synapse, there are “reuptake pumps” in\nthe membrane of the axon terminal. They take up the neurotransmitters\nand recycle them, putting them back into those secretory vesicles to be\nused again.* The second option is for the neurotransmitter to be\ndegraded in the synapse by an enzyme, with the breakdown products\ntranslate that into the excitation terms of the previous section—you want\nto increase excitability across the synapse, such that an action potential\nin the presynaptic neuron has more of an oomph in the postsynaptic\nneuron, which is to say it has an increased likelihood of causing an\naction potential in that second neuron. You could increase the amount of\nneurotransmitter released—the presynaptic neuron yells louder. Or you\ncould increase the amount of receptor on the dendritic spine—the\npostsynaptic neuron is listening more acutely.\nBut as another possibility, you could decrease the activity of the\nreuptake pump. As a result, less of the neurotransmitter is removed from\nthe synapse. Thus it sticks around longer and binds to the receptors\nrepeatedly, amplifying the signal. Or, as the conceptual equivalent, you\ncould decrease the activity of the degradative enzyme; less\nneurotransmitter is broken down, so more sticks around longer in the\nsynapse, having an enhanced effect. As we saw, some of the most\ninteresting findings that help explain individual differences in the\nbehaviors that concern us in this book relate to amounts of\npotentials from the axon terminals of all of the hundred billion neurons?\nHere’s where things get complicated, because there is more than one type\nof neurotransmitter.\nWhy more than one? The same thing happens in every synapse,\nwhich is that the neurotransmitter binds to its key-in-a-lock receptor and\ntriggers the opening of various channels that allow the ions to flow and\nmakes the inside of the spine a bit less negatively charged.\nOne reason is that different neurotransmitters depolarize to different\nextents—in other words, some have more excitatory effects than others\n—and for different durations. This allows for a lot more complexity in\ninformation being passed from one neuron to the next.\nAnd now to double the size of our palette, there are some\nneurotransmitters that don’t depolarize, don’t increase the likelihood of\nthe next neuron in line having an action potential. They do the opposite\n—they “hyperpolarize” the dendritic spine, opening different types of\nchannels that make the resting potential even more negative (e.g.,\nshifting from –70 mV to –80 mV). In other words, there are such things\nas inhibitory neurotransmitters. You can see how that has just made\nthings more complicated—a neuron with its ten thousand dendritic\nspines is getting excitatory inputs of differing magnitudes from various\nneurons, getting inhibitory ones from other neurons, and integrating all\nof this at the axon hillock.\nThus there are lots of different classes of neurotransmitters, each\nbinding to a unique receptor site that is complementary to its shape. Are\nthere a bunch of different types of neurotransmitters in each axon\nterminal, so that an action potential triggers the release of a whole\norchestration of signaling? Here is where we invoke Dale’s Principle,\nnamed for Henry Dale, one of the grand pooh-bahs of the field, who in\nthe 1930s proposed a rule whose veracity forms the very core of each\nneuroscientist’s sense of well-being: an action potential releases the same\ntype of neurotransmitter from all of the axon terminals of a neuron.\nTherefore there will be a distinctive neurochemical profile to a particular\nneuron—“Oh, that neuron is a neurotransmitter A–type neuron. And\nacetylcholine, glutamate (the most excitatory neurotransmitter in the\nbrain), and GABA (the most inhibitory). It’s at this point that medical\nstudents are tortured with all the multisyllabic details of how each\nneurotransmitter is synthesized—its precursor, the intermediate forms\nthe precursor is converted to until finally arriving at the real thing, the\npainfully long names of the various enzymes that catalyze the syntheses.\nAmid that there are some pretty simple rules built around three points:\na. You do not ever want to find yourself running for your\nlife from a lion and, oopsies, the neurons that tell your\nmuscles to run fast go off-line because they’ve run out\nof neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters are therefore\nmade from precursors that are plentiful; often they are\nsimple dietary constituents. Serotonin and dopamine, for\nexample, are made from the dietary amino acids\ntryptophan and tyrosine, respectively. Acetylcholine is\nmade from dietary choline and lecithin.\nb. A neuron can potentially have dozens of action\npotentials a second. Each involves restocking the\nvesicles with more neurotransmitter, releasing them, and\nmopping up afterward. Given that, you do not want your\nneurotransmitters to be huge, complex, ornate\nmolecules, each of which requires generations of\nstonemasons to construct. Instead they are all made in a\nsmall number of steps from their precursors. They’re\ncheap and easy to make. For example, it takes only two\nsimple synthetic steps to turn tyrosine into dopamine.\nc. Finally, to complete this pattern of neurotransmitter\nsynthesis as cheap and easy, multiple neurotransmitters\ncan be generated from the same precursor. In neurons\nthat use dopamine as the neurotransmitter, for example,\nthere are two enzymes that do those two construction\nsteps. Meanwhile, in norepinephrine-releasing neurons\nYesterday’s newspaper is useful today only for house-training puppies.\nNeuropharmacology\nAs these neurotransmitterology insights emerged, they allowed\nscientists to begin to understand how various “neuroactive” and\n“psychoactive” drugs and medicines work.\nBroadly, such drugs fall into two categories: those that increase\nsignaling across a particular type of synapse, and those that decrease it.\nWe already saw some of the strategies for increasing signaling: (a)\nStimulate more synthesis of the neurotransmitter (for example, by\nadministering the precursor or using a drug that increases the activity of\nthe enzymes that synthesize the neurotransmitter). As an example,\nParkinson’s disease involves a loss of dopamine in one brain region, and\na staple of treatment is to boost dopamine levels by administering the\ndrug L-DOPA, which is the immediate precursor of dopamine. (b)\nAdminister a synthetic version of the neurotransmitter, or a drug that is\nstructurally close enough to the real thing to fool the receptors.\nPsilocybin, for example, is structurally similar to serotonin and activates\na subtype of its receptors. (c) Stimulate the postsynaptic neuron to make\nmore receptors. Fine in theory, but not easily done. (d) Inhibit\ndegradative enzymes so that more of the neurotransmitter sticks around\nin the synapse. (e) Inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter,\nprolonging its effects in the synapse. The modern antidepressant of\nchoice, Prozac, does exactly that in serotonin synapses. Thus it is often\nreferred to as an “SSRI”—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\nMeanwhile, a pharmacopeia of drugs are available to decrease\nsignaling across synapses, and you can see what their underlying\nmechanisms are going to include—blocking the synthesis of a\nneurotransmitter, blocking its release, blocking its access to its receptor,\nand so on. Fun example: Acetylcholine stimulates your diaphragm to\ncontract. Curare, the poison used in darts by Amazonian tribes, blocks\nacetylcholine receptors. You stop breathing.\nwell.\nMORE THAN TWO NEURONS AT A TIME\ne have now triumphantly reached the point of thinking about\nthree neurons at a time. And within not too many pages, we will\nhave gone wild and considered even more than three. The purpose of this\nsection is to see how circuits of neurons work, the intermediate step\nbefore examining what entire regions of the brain have to do with the\nbest and worst of our behaviors. Therefore, the examples here were\nchosen merely to give a flavor of how things work at this level.\nNeuromodulation\nConsider the following diagram:\nThe axon terminal of neuron B forms a synapse with the dendritic\nof neuron B.\nWhat’s up with this? Neuron A releases the inhibitory\nneurotransmitter GABA, which floats across that “axoaxonic” synapse\nand binds to receptors on that side of neuron B’s axon terminal. And\nsuch an inhibitory effect (i.e., making that –70 mV resting potential even\nmore negative) snuffs out any action potential hurtling down that branch\nof the axon, keeps it from getting to the very end and releasing\nneurotransmitter; in the jargon of the field, neuron A is having a\nneuromodulatory effect on neuron B.\nSharpening a Signal over Time and Space\nNow for a new type of circuitry. To accommodate this, I’m using a\nsimpler way of representing neurons. As diagrammed, neuron A sends\nall of its axonal projections to neuron B and releases an excitatory\nneurotransmitter, symbolized by the plus sign. The circle in neuron B\nrepresents the cell body plus all the dendritic branches.\nNow consider the next circuit. Neuron A stimulates neuron B, as\nusual. In addition, it also stimulates neuron C. This is routine, with\nneuron A splitting its axonal projections between the two target cells,\nexciting both. And what does neuron C do? It sends an inhibitory\nprojection back onto neuron A, forming a negative feedback loop. Back\nto the brain loving contrasts, energetically screaming its head off when it\nhas something to say, and energetically being silent otherwise. This is a\nmore macro level of the same. Neuron A fires off a series of action\npotentials. What better way to energetically communicate that it’s all\nover than to become majorly silent, thanks to the feedback loop? It’s a\nmeans of sharpening a signal over time.* And note that neuron A can\n“determine” how powerful that negative feedback signal will be by how\nNeuron A stimulates B and C. Neuron C sends an inhibitory signal\non to neuron B that will arrive sometime after B starts getting stimulated\n(since the A/C/B loop is two synaptic steps, versus one for A/B). Result?\nSharpening a signal with “feed-forward inhibition.”\nNow for another type of sharpening of a signal, of increasing the\nneurons A and E.* Thus, if neuron C is stimulated, it both stimulates\nneuron D and silences neurons A and E. With such “lateral inhibition,” C\nscreams its head off while A and E become especially silent. It’s a means\nof sharpening a spatial signal (and note that the diagram is simplified, in\nthat I’ve omitted something obvious—neurons A and E also send\ninhibitory collateral projection on to neuron C, as well as to the neurons\non the other sides of them in this imaginary network).\nLateral inhibition like this is ubiquitous in sensory systems. Shine a\ntiny dot of light onto an eye. Wait, was that photoreceptor neuron A, C,\nor E that just got stimulated? Thanks to lateral inhibition, it is clearer that\nit was C. Ditto in tactile systems, allowing you to tell that it was this\nsmidgen of skin that was just touched, not a little this way or that. Or the\nears telling you it was definitely an A, not an A-sharp or A-flat.*\nThus what we’ve seen is another example of contrast enhancement in\nthe nervous system. What is the significance of the fact that the silent\nstate of a neuron is negatively charged, rather than a neutral 0 mV? It’s a\nway of sharpening a signal within a neuron. Feedback, feed-forward, and\nthis circuit because it is just so elegant:\nNeuron A’s dendrites sit just below the surface of the skin, and the\nneuron has an action potential in response to a painful stimulus. Neuron\nA then stimulates neuron B, which projects up the spinal cord, letting\nyou know that something painful just happened. But neuron A also\nstimulates neuron C, which inhibits B. This is one of our feed-forward\ninhibitory circuits. Result? Neuron B fires for a while and then is\nsilenced, and you perceive this as a sharp pain—you’ve been poked with\na needle.\nMeanwhile, there’s neuron D, whose dendrites are in the same\ngeneral area of the skin and respond to a different type of painful\nstimulus. As before, neuron D excites neuron B, and the message is sent\nup to the brain. But it also sends projections to neuron C, where it\ninhibits it. Result? When neuron D is activated by a pain signal, it\ninhibits the ability of neuron C to inhibit neuron B. And you perceive it\nas a throbbing, continuous pain, like a burn or abrasion. Importantly, this\nis reinforced further by the fact that action potentials travel down the\naxon of neuron D much slower than in neuron A (having to do with that\nmyelin that I mentioned earlier—details aren’t important). So the pain in\nneuron A’s world is not only transient but also fast. Pain in the neuron D\nbranch not only is long-lasting but also has a slower onset.\nstimulating neuron C, you shut the system down for a while. And that is\nprecisely what we often do in such circumstances. An insect bite throbs\nunbearably, we scratch hard right around it to dull the pain, and the slow,\nchronic pain pathway is shut down for up to a few minutes.\nThe fact that pain works this way has important clinical implications.\nFor one thing, it has allowed scientists to design treatments for people\nwith severe chronic pain syndromes (for example, someone with a severe\nback injury). Implanting a little electrode into the fast pain pathway and\nattaching it to a stimulator on the person’s hip enables the patient to buzz\nthat pathway now and then to turn off the chronic pain; it works wonders\nin many cases.\nThus we have a circuit that encompasses a temporal sharpening\nmechanism, introduces the double negative of inhibiting inhibitors, and\nis just all-around cool. And one of the biggest reasons why I love it is\nthat it was first proposed in 1965 by the great neurobiologists Ronald\nMelzack and Patrick Wall. It was merely proposed as a theoretical model\n—“No one has ever seen this sort of wiring, but we propose that it’s got\nto look something like this, given how pain works.” And subsequent\nwork showed that’s exactly how this part of the nervous system is wired.\nWhich Guy Is It?\n700\nNeuron A projects to neurons 1, 2, and 3; neuron B projects to 2, 3,\nand 4, etc. Now let’s show how hypothetical this circuit is by giving\nneurons A, B, and C completely imaginary functions. Neuron A\nresponds to the picture of the guy on the left, B to the guy in the middle,\nC to the one on the right:\n\n701\nWhat can neuron 1 learn? How to recognize that particular guy.\nNeuron 5 is equally specialized. But what can neuron 3 learn? How\nVictorian gentlemen dressed. It’s the neuron that will help you identify\nthe Victorian in the quartet below:\nNeuron 3’s knowledge is general and comes from the overlap of the\nfirst layer’s projections. Neurons 2 and 4 are also generalist neurons, but\n\nfanciest parts of the brain are wired up in a way that resembles this fairy-\ntale circuit, writ large—at the same time, neuron 3 is a more peripheral\nelement in some other circuit sending projections to it (say, a circuitry\nthat would be drawn perpendicular to this page), neuron 1 is at the very\ncenter of some other network in the fourth dimension, and so on. All of\nthese neurons are embedded within multiple networks.\nWhat does this produce? The capacity for association, metaphor,\nanalogy, parable, symbol. To link two disparate things, even from\ndifferent sensory modalities. To Homerically associate the color of wine\nwith the color of the sea, that both “tomato” and “potato” can be\npronounced in two different ways in a song, that a bright red tongue\nsticking out can remind you of music by the Stones. It’s why I associate\nStravinsky and Picasso, given that albums (remember those?) of\nStravinsky’s music always seemed to have a Picasso painting on the\ncover. And it’s why a rectangular piece of cloth with a distinctive pattern\nof colors on it can stand for an entire nation or people or ideology.\nA final point. We differ as to the nature and spread of our associative\nnetworks. And extremes of them can produce very interesting things at\ntimes. For example, most of us learned early on to associate something\nresembling the following with the concept of “face”:\nBut then someone comes along whose associate networks of\n703\nWhat might we call the consequence of some types of atypically\nwide associative nets of neurons? Creativity.\nOne More Round of Scaling Up\nA neuron, two neurons, a neuronal circuit. We’re ready now, as a last\nstep, to scale up to the level of thousands of neurons at once.\nConsider the following slice of tissue viewed under a microscope:\n\nThis is a liver in cross-section; if you’ve seen one part, you’ve seen it\nall. Boring.\nIf the brain were this homogeneous and boring, it would be an\nundifferentiated mass of tissue, with neuronal cell bodies carpeted evenly\nall over the place, sending out their processes every which way. Instead\nthere’s a huge amount of internal organization:\nIn other words, the cell bodies of neurons that have related functions\nare clumped together in particular regions of the brain, and the axons that\nthey send to other parts of the brain are organized into projection cables.\nWhat all this means, crucially, is that different parts of the brain do\ndifferent things. All the regions of the brain have names (usually\nmultisyllabic and derived from Greek or Latin), as do the subregions,\nand the sub-subregions. Moreover, each talks to a consistent collection of\nother regions (i.e., sends axons to them) and is talked to by a consistent\ncollection (i.e., receives axonal projections from them).\nYou can go crazy studying all this, as I’ve seen, tragically, in the case\nof many a neuroanatomist who relishes all these details. For our purposes\nthere are some key points:\nEach particular region contains millions of neurons.\nis confusing, as the part of every cell that contains the\nDNA is also called the nucleus. What can you do?)\nSome probably totally unfamiliar names, just as\nexamples: the basal nucleus of Meynert, the supraoptic\nnucleus of the hypothalamus, the charmingly named\ninferior olive nucleus.\nAs described, the cell bodies of neurons with related\nfunctions are clumped together in their particular region\nor nucleus and send their axonal projections off in the\nsame direction, merging together into a cable (a “fiber\ntract”). Here’s an example, taken from the hippocampus:\nBack to that myelin wrapping around axons that helps\naction potentials propagate faster. Myelin tends to be\nwhite, sufficiently so that the fiber tract cables in the\nbrain look white. Thus they’re generically referred to as\n“white matter.”\nAs can be seen, a lot of the brain is taken up by the fiber\npart of the brain, mysterious spot X.\nThis gives the opportunity to learn\nsomething about the brain by now\nseeing what no longer works right in\nthe person. Neuroscience as a field\nreally got its starts thanks to studies of soldiers who had\nsuffered “missile projection wounds.” Viewed in a\ndetached manner, the endless nineteenth-century\nEuropean military bloodbaths were God’s gift to\nneuroanatomists. The injured individual now does\nsomething abnormally. Can you conclude that spot X is\nthe part of the brain responsible for the normal version\nof that behavior? Only if it’s where a cluster of neuronal\ncell bodies are. If spot X is a fiber tract, you’re actually\nlearning something about the region of the brain whose\nneurons sent axonal projections in that fiber tract, and\nthat region could be at the other end of the brain. So it’s\nimportant to distinguish between “neuronal nuclei” and\n“fibers of passage.”\nFinally, back to the reference just now about a part of\nthe brain being the center for some behavior. The\nexamples from earlier in the chapter showed how hard it\nis to make sense of the function of an individual neuron\nwithout considering the network that it is part of. Same\ntheme here, writ large. Given that every brain region is\ngetting projections from and sending projections to a\nzillion other places, it is rare that an individual brain\nregion is “the center for” anything. Instead it’s all\nnetworks where, far more often, a particular region\n“plays a key role in,” “helps mediate,” or “influences” a\nbehavior. The function of a particular brain region is"

    "content": "The Basics of\nEndocrinology\nndocrinology is the study of hormones, very different sorts of\nmessengers from the neurotransmitters of chapter 2. As a recap,\nneurotransmitters are released from neurons’ axon terminals in response\nto action potentials. Once released, they travel a microscopic distance\nacross the synapse and bind to receptors on dendrites of the second,\npostsynaptic neuron, thereby changing that neuron’s excitability.\nIn contrast, a hormone is a chemical messenger released from\nsecretory cells (including neurons) in various glands. Once secreted, it\nenters the bloodstream, where it can influence any cells throughout the\nbody that possess receptors for it.* So right off the bat we have key\ndifferences. First, neurotransmitters directly affect only neurons on the\nother side of synapses, while a hormone can potentially affect each of the\ntrillions of cells in the body. A second difference is the time course;\nneurotransmitter signaling across synapses occurs in milliseconds. In\ncontrast, many hormonal effects emerge over hours to days and can\npersist forever (for example, how often does puberty go away after a\nwhile?).\nNeurotransmitters and hormones also differ in the scale of their\neffects. A neurotransmitter binds to its postsynaptic receptor, resulting in\na local change in the flow of ions across the membrane of that dendritic\nexample, increases muscle mass, and progesterone causes the\nproliferation of cells in the uterus, causing it to thicken during the luteal\nphase. Conversely, thyroid hormone kills cells in a tadpole’s tail as the\nanimal is metamorphosing into a frog, and a class of stress hormones can\nkill cells in the immune system (helping to explain how stress makes us\nvulnerable to getting a cold). Hormones are extremely versatile.\nMost hormones are part of a “neuroendocrine axis.” Recall from\nchapter 2 how all roads in the limbic system lead to the hypothalamus,\nwith its pivotal role in regulating the autonomic nervous system and\nhormonal systems. Here’s where that second part comes in. Neurons in\nthe hypothalamus secrete a particular hormone that travels in a tiny, local\ncirculatory system connecting to the pituitary, just below the base of the\nbrain. There that hormone stimulates the secretion of a particular\npituitary hormone, which enters the general circulation and stimulates\nthe secretion of a third hormone from some peripheral gland. Here’s an\nexample involving my three favorite hormones: during stress,\nhypothalamic neurons secrete CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone),\nwhich stimulates pituitary cells to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropic\nhormone). Once in the general circulation, ACTH gets to the adrenal\nglands, where it stimulates secretion of steroid stress hormones called\nglucocorticoids (with the human version being cortisol, aka\nhydrocortisone). Other hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone,\ntestosterone, and thyroid hormone) are released from peripheral glands\nas the final step of their own “hypothalamic/pituitary/peripheral gland\naxis.”* As a wonderful complication, the secretion of each particular\npituitary hormone is often not under the control of only a single\nhypothalamic releasing hormone. Instead there are multiple types of\nhormones serving that function, and other hypothalamic hormones that\ninhibit that particular pituitary hormone’s release. For example, an array\nof hypothalamic hormones in addition to CRH regulates the release of\nACTH, where different types of stressors produce different combinations\nof those hypothalamic hormones.\nNot all hormones are regulated in this brain/pituitary/peripheral gland\nmanner. In some cases there’s a brain/pituitary two-step, where the\ncirculating glucose levels are the main regulator). Then there are weirdo\nhormones secreted from unlikely places like the heart or gut, where the\nbrain regulates secretion only indirectly.\nHormones, like neurotransmitters, are made cheaply. They are\nconstructed in just a few biosynthetic steps from plentiful precursors—\neither simple proteins or cholesterol.* Moreover, the body generates\nmultiple types of hormones from the same precursor. For example, the\nnumerous steroid hormones are all generated from cholesterol.\nSo far we’ve given short shrift to hormone receptors. They do the\nsame general job as do neurotransmitter receptors; there is a distinctive\nreceptor molecule for each type of hormone,* with a concave binding\ndomain whose shape is complementary to the shape of the hormone. To\ntrot out the same cliché as was used for neurotransmitters, a hormone fits\ninto its receptor like a key fits into a lock. And as with neurotransmitter\nreceptors, there’s no free lunch with hormone receptors. The various\nsteroid hormones are structurally similar. Thus, if you’re cheap at the\nproduction end, you need subtle, fancy receptors that differentiate among\nthose similar hormones—you do not want receptors that confuse, say,\nestrogen and testosterone.\nHormone/neurotransmitter similarities continue. Like\nneurotransmitter receptors, a hormone receptor’s “avidity” for its\nhormone can change. This means that the shape of the binding site\nchanges a bit, so that the hormone now fits more or less snugly, thus\nincreasing or decreasing the duration of the hormone’s effects. The\nnumber of receptors for a particular hormone in a cell can also change,\naltering the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone’s effects. The number of\nreceptors in a target cell can be as important as the levels of the hormone\nitself, and there are endocrine diseases where normal levels of a hormone\nare secreted but, because of a mutation in the hormone’s receptor, no\nsignal gets through. Hormone levels are akin to how loudly someone\nspeaks. Receptor levels are akin to the acuity with which ears detect that\nvoice.\nFinally, receptors for a hormone typically occur in only a subset of\ncells and tissues in the body, meaning that only those are responsive to\npromoting effects of the hormone.\nThis is our overview of how hormones alter the functions of target\ncells over the course of hours to days. Hormones were highly pertinent in\nchapter 7 when considering the effects of hormones in childhood and\nfetal life. Specifically, hormones can have permanent “organizational”\neffects during development, shaping how the brain is constructed. In\ncontrast, “activational” effects persist for hours to days. These two\ndomains interact, in that organizational hormone effects on a fetal brain\ninfluence what activational effects hormones will have on that brain in"

    "content": "Protein Basics\nroteins are a class of organic compounds that are the most\nabundant molecules in living systems. They are hugely important,\nsince numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, and messengers of the\nimmune system are made of protein; ditto for the receptors that respond\nto those messengers, the enzymes that construct or degrade them,* the\nscaffolding that shapes a cell, and so on.\nA key feature of proteins is their shape, since the shape of a protein\ndetermines its function. Proteins that form the scaffolding of a cell have\nthe shape of the different crossbars in scaffolding at construction sites\n(sort of). A protein hormone will have a distinctive shape that is unique\nand distinctively different from the shape of a hormone that has different\neffects.* And a protein receptor must have a shape that is complementary\nto the shape of the hormone or neurotransmitter that it binds (back to the\ntime-honored cliché of appendix 1, namely that a messenger like a\nhormone fits into its receptor like a key into a lock).\nSome proteins change their shape, typically moving between two\nconformations. Suppose you have an enzyme (again, a protein) that\nsynthesizes a molecule of sucrose by linking a molecule of glucose to a\nmolecule of fructose. The enzyme must have one conformation that\nresembles the letter V, where one end binds a glucose molecule at a\nparticular angle, the other fructose. The binding of both triggers the\nenzyme to shift to its other conformation, where the two ends of the V\ntypes of amino acids—including some familiar ones like tryptophan and\nglutamate. Each protein’s string of amino acids is unique—like the string\nof letters that composes a word. Your typical protein is about 300 amino\nacids long, and with 20 different amino acid types, there are nearly 10400\npossible sequences (that’s ten followed by four hundred zeros)—more\natoms than there are in the universe.* The amino acid sequence of a\nprotein influences the unique shape(s) of that protein. Dogma used to be\nthat amino acid sequence determines the shape(s) of that protein, but it\nturns out that the shape is also subtly altered by things like temperature\nand acidity—in other words, environmental influences.\nAnd what determines the sequence of amino acids that are strung\ntogether to form a particular protein? A particular gene.\nDNA AS THE BLUEPRINT FOR\nCONSTRUCTING PROTEINS\nDNA is another class of organic compounds, and just as there are\nroughly 20 different types of amino acids, there are 4 different “letters”\n(called nucleotides) that make up DNA. A sequence of 3 nucleotides\n(called a codon) codes for a single amino acid. If there are 4 different\ntypes of nucleotides, and each codon is 3 nucleotides long, there can be a\ntotal of 64 different codons (4 possibilities in the first place × 4 in the\nsecond × 4 in the third = 64). A few of those 64 are reserved to signal the\nend of a gene, and after eliminating those “stop codons,” there are 61\ndifferent codons coding for 20 different amino acids. Therefore, there is\n“redundancy”—almost all amino acids can be specified by more than\none unique codon (an average of about 3, i.e., 61/20). Typically the\ndifferent codons coding for the same amino acid differ by only a single\nnucleotide. For example, four different codon sequences code for the\namino acid alanine: GCA, GCC, GCG, and GCT (A, C, G, and T are the\ngenome, coding for all of the tens of thousands of genes in an organism;\n“sequencing” the genome means determining the unique sequence of the\nbillions of nucleotides that make up that organism’s genome. That stretch\nof DNA is so long (containing roughly twenty thousand genes in\nhumans) that it has to be broken into separate volumes, called\nchromosomes.\nThis produces a spatial problem. The DNA library is found in the\ncenter of the cell, in the nucleus. Proteins, however, occur all over the\ncell, are constructed all over it (just think of proteins in the axon\nterminals of a spinal neuron in a blue whale, terminals that are light-\nyears away from that neuron’s nucleus). How do you get the DNA\ninformation out to where the protein is made? There is an intermediary\nthat completes the picture. The unique nucleotide sequence in DNA that\ncodes for a particular gene is copied into a string of similar nucleotide\nletters in a related compound called RNA. Any given chromosome\ncontains a staggeringly long stretch of DNA, coding for one gene after\nanother; in contrast, this stretch of RNA is only as long as the particular\ngene. In other words, a more manageable length. That RNA is then\nshipped to wherever it is supposed to be in the cell, where it then directs\nwhich amino acids are strung together in which sequence to form a\nprotein (and there are amino acids floating around in a cell, ready to be\ngrabbed for the protein-construction project). Think of RNA as a\nphotocopy of a single page out of this vast twenty-thousand-page-long\nDNA encyclopedia. (And multiple copies of the cognate protein can be\nmade from the instructions in a photocopy page of RNA. This sure helps\nin circumstances where copies of the protein must wind up in each of the\nthousands of a single neuron’s axon terminals.)\nThis produces what is termed the “central dogma” of life, a concept\nfirst framed in the early 1960s by Francis Crick, half of the renowned\nWatson and Crick, who discovered the “double helix” structure of DNA\n(with more than a little purloined help from Rosalind Franklin, but that’s\nanother story). Crick’s central dogma holds that the nucleotide sequence\nof DNA that composes a gene determines how a unique stretch of RNA\nis put together . . . which determines how a unique stretch of amino acids\nJust for everyone’s sanity, I’m going to mostly ignore RNA. For our\npurposes, what is interesting is what genes, the starting point, have to do\nwith their end products—proteins and their functions.\nMUTATIONS AND POLYMORPHISMS\nGenes are inherited from your parents (half the genes from each [not\nentirely true, as covered in the main text]). Suppose that when someone’s\nDNA genome is being copied for inclusion in their egg or sperm, a\nmistake is made in the copying of one single nucleotide; with billions of\nnucleotides, that’s bound to happen sometimes. As a result, unless\ncorrected, the gene, now with its nucleotide sequence erroneously\ndiffering in one spot, is passed on to an offspring. This is a mutation.\nIn classical genetics there are three types of mutations that can occur.\nThe first is called a point mutation. One single nucleotide is copied\nincorrectly. Will this change the amino acid sequence of the protein\ncoded for? It depends. Back to redundancy in the DNA code, from a few\nparagraphs ago. Suppose there is a codon in a gene with the sequence\nGCT, coding for alanine. But there has been a mutation, yielding GCA\ninstead. No problem—that still codes for alanine. It’s an inconsequential,\n“neutral” mutation. But suppose the mutation instead was GAT. This\ncodes for a completely different amino acid called asparagine. Uh-oh.\nIn actuality, though, this may not be a big deal, if the new amino acid\nlooks a lot like the one that was lost. Suppose you have a nucleotide\nsequence coding for the following metaphorical amino acid sequence:\n“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”\nThanks to a subtle mutation, there is a change of one amino acid, but\none without a ton of consequences:\n“I/am/now/going/ta/do/the/following”\nThis would still be comprehensible to most people; the protein would\nmerely be perceived as coming from New York. Translated into protein-\n(even fatal).\nBack to\n“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”\nWhat if there is a mutation in a nucleotide helping to code for the\nfirst w, a mutation with a big consequence?\n“I/am/not/going/to/do/the/following”\nTrouble.\nThe next type of classical mutation is called a deletion mutation. In\nthis scenario a copying error is made during the inheritance of a gene.\nBut instead of a nucleotide being miscopied, it is deleted. For example,\nin a case where the seventh nucleotide is deleted,\n“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”\nbecomes\n“I/am/now/oingt/od/ot/hef/ollowing”\nThis can frameshift everything over to generate gibberish, or even a\ndifferent message (e.g., “For dessert I’d like the mousse” mutating to\n“For dessert I’d like the mouse”).\nDeletion mutations can involve the loss of more than a single\nnucleotide. At an extreme, this can involve the deletion of the entire\ngene, or even a stretch of genes on a particular chromosome. Definitely\nnot good.\nFinally, there are insertion mutations. During copying of the DNA to\npass on to the next generation, a nucleotide is inadvertently copied twice,\nduplicated. Thus:\n“I/am/now/going/to/do/the/following”\nbecomes\n“I/am/now/ggoin/gt/od/oth/efollowin”\nGibberish, or perhaps a different message, as in the following case,\nwhere an e has been inserted near the end of the string of letters: “Mary\nturned John down for a date because she did not enjoy boweling.” In\nsome cases an insertion mutation can involve the insertion of more than a\nsingle nucleotide. At an extreme, this can even involve the duplication of\nan entire gene.\nBack to point mutations. Consider one that results in the substitution\nof a single amino acid in the protein, one that works a bit differently\nfrom the correct amino acid. As noted above, as a result, the protein still\ndoes its old job, but maybe does it a bit faster or slower. This could be\nthe grist for evolutionary change—if the new version is disadvantageous,\nreducing the reproductive success of anyone who carries it, it will be\ngradually selected against, removing it from a population. If instead the\nnew version is more advantageous, it will gradually replace the old one\nin a population. Or if the new version works better than the original in\nsome circumstances but worse in others, it may reach equilibrium in the\npopulation with the original version, where a certain percentage of\npeople have the old version, the remainder the new. In this case the\nparticular gene would be described as coming in two different forms or\nvariants, as coming with two different “alleles.” Most genes come with\nmultiple alleles. And the result is individual variation in the functioning\nof genes (this is covered in far more complexity in chapter 8).\nFinally, a clarification of the confusion where two sound bites about\ngenetics collide. The first is that, on the average, full (non–identical\ntwin) siblings share 50 percent of their genes.* The other is that we share\n98 percent of our genes with chimps. So are we more related to chimps\nthan to our siblings? No. Comparisons between humans and chimps are\nabout types of traits—we both have genes coding for traits related to\nhaving, for example, eyes, muscle fibers, or dopamine receptors, and\nboth lack genes related to having, for example, gills, antennae, or flower\npetals. So there’s 98 percent overlap at that level of comparison. But\ncomparison between any two humans is about versions of those traits—\nboth have a gene that codes for, say, this thing called eye color, but do\nthey share the version that codes for the same particular color? Same for"

McClintock, “Menstrual Synchrony and Suppression,” Nat 229 (1971): 244. While a\nnumber of studies have replicated the Wellesley effect, some have not, as summarized in H.\nWilson, “A Critical Review of Menstrual Synchrony Research,” PNE 17 (1992): 565. A\ncritique of that critique can be found in M. McClintock, “Whither Menstrual Synchrony?”\nARSR 9 (1998): 77.\n9.\tV. S.

Konner, The\nTangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit (New York: Henry Holt, 2003).\nThis is the finest book in existence on the biology of human social behavior—subtle, nuanced,\nnondogmatic, and wonderfully written—by the anthropologist/physician Mel Konner. To my\nvast good fortune, Konner was my academic adviser and mentor when I was an undergraduate,\nand he has had the greatest intellectual impact on me of anyone in my life. Those who know\nMel will recognize his intellectual imprint on every page of this book.\nChapter 1: The Behavior\n1.\tFootnote: F. Gervasi. The Life and Times of Menachem Begin.

    "content": "835\nRobert M. Sapolsky is the author of several works of nonfiction,\nincluding A Primate’s Memoir, The Trouble with Testosterone, and Why\nZebras Don’t Get Ulcers. He is a professor of biology and neurology at\nStanford University and the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation genius\ngrant. He lives in San Francisco.\n\n836\n* Shortly after making this pronouncement, Watson fled academia amid sexual scandal. He eventually resurfaced as the vice\npresident of an advertising company. You may not be able to shape people into anything you wish, but at least you can often\nshape them into buying some useless gewgaw.\n\n837\n* I recently found a startling example of unorthodox defining of terms. This concerned Menachem Begin, one of the\nsurprising architects of the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978 as the prime minister of Israel. In the mid-1940s he headed\nthe Irgun, the Zionist paramilitary group intent on driving Britain out of Palestine in order to facilitate the founding of Israel.\nThe Irgun raised money to buy arms through extortion and robbery, hanged two captive British soldiers and booby-trapped\ntheir bodies, and carried out a series of bombings including, most notoriously, an attack on British headquarters at\nJerusalem’s King David Hotel, an act that killed not only numerous British officials but also scores of Arab and Jewish\ncivilians. And Begin’s account of these activities? “Historically we were not ‘terrorists.’ We were, strictly speaking, anti-\nterrorists” (my emphasis).\n\n838\n* I’ve observed a remarkable example of this among the baboons that I’ve studied in East Africa. Over the thirty-odd years\nI’ve watched them, I’ve seen a handful of instances of what I believe warrants the seemingly human-specific term “rape”—\nwhere a male baboon will forcibly vaginally penetrate a female who is not in estrus, who is not sexually receptive, who\nstruggles to prevent it, and who gives every indication of distress and pain when it happens. And each of these instances has\nbeen the act of the former alpha male in the hours after he has been toppled from his position.\n\nwith rhythmic stamping, menacing gestures, guttural shouting, and histrionically threatening facial expressions. It’s cool to\nsee from afar on YouTube (even better is watching the YouTube clip of Robin Williams doing a haka display at Charlie Rose\non PBS), while up close it typically appears to scare the bejesus out of the other team. However, some opposing teams have\ncome up with ritualistic responses straight out of the baboon playbook—getting in the haka-ers’ faces and trying to stare\nthem down. Other teams come out with ritualistic responses that are pure human uniqueness—ignoring the haka-ers while\nnonchalantly warming up; using their smartphones to film the display, thereby emasculating it to something vaguely touristy\nin flavor; tepidly applauding afterward with great condescension. One response initially seems uniquely human but would be\nmedical system. This is not someone falsely telling the pediatrician that her child had a fever last night. This is giving\nchildren emetics to induce vomiting, poisoning them, smothering them to induce symptoms of hypoxia—often with fatal\nconsequences. One feature of the disorder is a stunning lack of affect in the mothers. One would expect an air of spittle-\nflecked madness to match the actions. Instead, there is cold detachment, as if they could simply be lying to a veterinarian\nabout their supposedly sick goldfish or to customer service at Sears about their supposedly broken toaster, if doing so would\nbring the same psychological benefits. For a lengthy overview of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, see R. Sapolsky,\n841\n* It is also often called the “involuntary nervous system,” contrasting it with the “voluntary nervous system.” The latter is\nabout conscious, voluntary movement and involves neurons in “motor” regions of the brain and their projections down the\nspine to skeletal muscles.\n\n842\n* Just as a warning of complexities to come, the hypothalamus consists of a bunch of different nuclei, each receiving a unique\norchestration of limbic inputs and equivalently distinctive outputs to various midbrain/brain-stem regions. And while each\nhypothalamic nucleus has a different set of functions, they all fall under the general rubric of autonomic regulation.\n\n843\n* And to needlessly complicate things further, thus explaining why this is buried in a footnote, there is actually an intervening\nsynapse between the long spinal projection neurons of the SNS and the SNS neurons reaching target cells. This is the second\nneuron in the two-step pathway that releases norepinephrine. The first neuron in each pathway releases acetylcholine.\n\n844\n* Nice logical piece of this: Suppose you’re stressed, not by running for your life from a lion but by having to give a speech.\nYour mouth gets dry, the first step of your SNS shutting down digestion until a more auspicious time.\n\n845\n* Like the SNS, the PNS gets the brain to target organs via two steps. And as one complication, the SNS and PNS branches\naren’t always working in complete opposition; in some cases they function in a more cooperative, sequential manner. For\nexample, erection and ejaculation involve coordination between the SNS and PNS that is so complicated that it’s a miracle\nthat any of us were conceived.\n\n846\n* In other words, layers 2 and 3 can influence the autonomic functions of layer 1, which alters events throughout the body,\nwhich in turn influences all the parts of the brain. Loops and loops.\n\n847\n* Nauta was not only a towering scientist but also a force of integrity, as well as a renowned teacher who made\nneuroanatomy, taught in three-hour evening classes, borderline fun. During college I did research in the lab next to his, and I\nwas so in awe of the guy that I’d find every possible autonomic excuse to go to the bathroom whenever I saw him heading in\nthat direction, just for the chance to offhandedly say hello to him by the urinals. (My awe grew further later, with my\ndiscovery that he and his family sheltered Jews from Nazis in Holland during World War II and are cited in the Holocaust\nMuseum in Washington, DC.)\n\n848\n* The word is from the Greek ἀμυγδαλἠ (thank you, Wikipedia), which means “almond,” which the amygdala very vaguely\nresembles. Weirdly, it turns out that the word also means “tonsil,” which must have produced some major malpractice suits\nwhen ancient Greeks went in for tonsillectomies.\n\n849\n* The amygdala is one of those “bilateral” structures, meaning that there are two of them, one in each hemisphere, mirroring\neach other.\n\n850\n* A note about specificity. To be confident that the amygdala really is selectively about aggression, you also have to show\nthat it activates more than do other brain regions and doesn’t activate as much during a hodgepodge of other behaviors.\n\n851\n* Wait, don’t the Marines want you to be physically threatening? Don’t they train you to be that way? This is a great example\nof the big theme of this book, namely the context dependency of our best and worst behaviors: what the Marines train people\nfor is to be majorly physically threatening . . . in certain contexts only.\n\n852\n* By the way, what does mouse anxiety look like? Mice dislike bright lights and open spaces—go figure, for a nocturnal\nanimal that lots of species like to eat. So one measure of mouse anxiety is how long it takes for a mouse to go into the center\nof a brightly lit area to get some food.\n\n853\n* We even have that profound renunciation of arachnophobia, namely kids becoming bereft when Charlotte dies in\nCharlotte’s Web.\n\n854\n* As an important point, throughout this book, whenever I describe work done by Jane Doe or Joe Smith, I actually mean\n“work done by Doe and a team of her postdocs, technicians, grad students, and collaborators spread far and wide over the\nyears.” I’ll be referring solely to Doe or Smith for brevity, not to imply that they did all the work on their own—science is\nutterly a team process. In addition, as long as we’re at it, another point: At endless junctures throughout the book, I’ll be\nreporting the results of a study, along the lines of, “And when you do whatever to this or that brain\nregion/neurotransmitter/hormone/gene/etc., X happens.” What I mean is that on the average X happens, and at a statistically\nreliable rate. There is always lots of variability, including individuals in whom nothing happens or even the opposite of X\noccurs.\n\n855\n* This is termed “Pavlovian conditioning” in a nod to Ivan Pavlov; it’s the same process by which Pavlov’s dogs learned to\nassociate the conditioned stimulus of a bell with the unconditioned stimulus of food, so that the former eventually was able to\nprovoke salivation. Less reliable are “operant conditioning” approaches, in which the degree to which something is scary is\nassessed by how much an individual will work to avoid being exposed to it.\n\n856\n* As usual in science, things aren’t all that clean—some of those “plastic” changes during fear conditioning also occur in the\ncentral amygdala.\n\n857\n* Just to make things more complicated, the BLA neurons are probably talking to the central amygdala neurons via\nmiddlemen called intercalated cells.\n\n858\n* I would be remiss not to touch on one issue in this field—when a new fear is learned, where is that memory stored? Next to\nthe amygdala is the hippocampus, which plays a key role in “explicit” learning about straightforward facts (e.g., someone’s\nname). While the hippocampus is where short-term knowledge about the name is turned into long-term memory, the memory\ntrace itself is most likely in the cortex. The hippocampus, to use a metaphor that will probably be obsolete by the time this\nbook sees the light of day, is the keyboard, the conduit, the portal to the cortical hard drive where a memory is stored. Is the\namygdala solely the keyboard (with fear memories stored elsewhere), or is it the hard drive as well? This has been an\nongoing, unresolved debate in the field, with the “keyboard + hard drive” view championed by LeDoux and the keyboard-\nalone view espoused by the equally accomplished scientist James McGaugh of the University of California at Irvine.\n\n859\n* An example of the sort of complexity we’re up against here: Both fear conditioning and fear extinction involve activation\nof inhibitory neurons. Hmm, that commonality seems weird, given opposite outcomes. It turns out that extinction involves\nactivation of neurons that inhibit excitatory neurons, while fear conditioning involves activation of inhibitory neurons that\ninhibit other inhibitory neurons that project onto excitatory neurons. A double negative, equaling a positive.\n\n860\n* How might you distinguish between sexual motivation and performance in a male rat? Well, the latter is easy—what’s the\nguy’s frequency and latency when with a sexually receptive female? But sexual motivation? This is measured by determining\nhow often a male will press a lever in order to get access to a female.\n\n861\n* I can’t resist mentioning a case report of a woman with epileptic seizures initiating in the amygdala. Before seizure onset,\nshe would have the delusion that she was male, including a sense that she had a deep voice and hairy arms.\n\n862\n* In contrast to this picture of growing, precarious arousal, the amygdala deactivates in both men and women during orgasm.\n\n863\n* This shortcut has been most cleanly demonstrated for auditory information, by LeDoux. The evidence for other sensory\nmodalities has been more inferential.\n\n864\n* Just to bring some specificity into it, the precise pattern of which subregions of the hypothalamus and which autonomic\nrelay nuclei are activated can vary with the type of stimulus—thus the fear and aggression associated with responding to a\npredator are somewhat different from those in response to the menace of a member of one’s own species; similarly, the\npattern of response in a rodent to the smell of a cat is a bit different from the response to a cat itself.\n\n865\n* Apologies to Micah 4:4.\n\n866\n* Strongly suggesting that these neurons independently evolved on three separate occasions, given the evolutionary distances\nbetween primates, cetaceans, and elephants. The nearest relatives of elephants, for example, are hyraxes and manatees. The\nconvergent evolution of von Economo neurons from three separate lineages emphasizes that these cells go hand in hand with\nmajor sociality.\n\n867\n* To give a sense of this, consider someone deciding whether to press a button. The frontal cortex makes its decision; know\nits neurons’ firing patterns, and you can predict the decision with 80 percent accuracy about seven hundred milliseconds\nbefore the person is consciously aware of their decision.\n\n868\n* This quaintly obsolete paragraph is written with the recognition that most of this is irrelevant in the age of smartphones and\nthe constant companionship of Siri.\n\n869\n* This test is reminiscent of something called the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). My wife, who spent her\nprofessional youth as a neuropsychologist, would practice tests on me when she was in grad school; the CVLT was, without\nquestion, the worst. It was insanely stressful—I’d be a sopping mess by the time she’d finally call it an evening. But on the\nother hand, this will pay off handsomely in a few decades when I ace the neuropsych tests out of habit, despite being\nseriously demented . . . and thus don’t get appropriate medical care. Hmm, I may need to rethink this.\n\n870\n* There’s a key exception to this, to be covered in chapter 13 on morality.\n\n871\n* There is an ongoing controversy in this field as to whether it is “willpower” or “motivation” being decreased by cognitive\nload. For our purposes, let’s think of them as synonymous.\n\n872\n* The apathy is in contrast to early-stage Alzheimer’s sufferers, who, after making some horrible social blunder due to\nmemory problems—say, asking after the health of someone’s spouse because they didn’t remember that the person died years\nago—are mortified.\n\n873\n* Ian McEwan’s novel Saturday pivots around behavioral disinhibition due to Huntington’s in a central character. It’s\nbrilliant.\n\n874\n* A quick primer for directions in the brain, for anyone who cares. They come in three dimensions: (1) Dorsal/ventral. Dorsal\n= the top of the brain (in the same way that the fin on the top of a horizontal dolphin is the dorsal fin). Ventral = the bottom.\n(2) Medial/lateral. Medial = at the midline of the brain, when viewed in cross section. Lateral = as far as possible from the\nmidline, moving left or right. Thus the “dorsolateral” PFC is the part of the PFC that is on top and to the outside. (3)\nAnterior/posterior. At the front or back of the brain. Lateralized brain structures come in pairs—one in the left hemisphere,\none in the right, both at the same place in the dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior planes, but in opposite locations in the\nmedial/lateral plane.\n\n875\n* To help keep “dlPFC” and “vmPFC” straight, I’ll constantly refer to their falsely dichotomized functions, just as a reminder\n—“the cognitive dlPFC” and “the emotional vmPFC.” Or here’s a mnemonic—“dl” of the cognitive dlPFC standing for\n“deliberative,” the “vm” of the emotional vmPFC as “very (e)motional.” Lame, but it’s saved me on a few occasions.\n\n876\n* Moreover, dlPFC patients are poor at the difficult task of taking someone else’s perspective. This is a subtype of something\ncalled Theory of Mind, and involves interactions between the dlPFC and a brain region called the temporoparietal juncture.\nMore in a later chapter.\n\n877\n* A reminder—as with all good studies of individuals with damage to particular brain regions, not only is there a control\ncomparison group of people with no brain damage, but there’s an additional control group of people with damage to other,\nunrelated parts of the brain.\n\n878\n* For those who care, some of the strongest responses are found in a subregion of the vmPFC called the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\n879\n* We will return to Greene’s subsequent “trolleyology” work at length in the chapter on morality. Broadly, it shows that the\ndiffering decisions pivot around (a) the personal/impersonal contrast between pulling a lever and pushing with your own\nhands, (b) the means/side effect contrast between the person’s death being a necessity and its being an unintentional by-\nproduct, (c) the psychological distance to the potential victim.\n\n880\n* Given the circuitry of the PFC, the most probable sequence is activation of the dlPFC, then activation of the vmPFC, then\ninhibition of the amygdala.\n\n881\n* And this extends to a metalevel of reappraisal, as Gross has shown that one mediator of treatment outcome when using\nCBT for social anxiety is the belief that one can effectively reappraise.\n\n882\n* And then there are circumstances where the limbic system overwhelms the frontal cortex, where there is no such thing as a\ngood decision, where each choice is worse than the other. Think about what is, for a parent, probably the most excruciating\nscene in all of cinema—in Sophie’s Choice, when Sophie must make the Choice, when, without warning, she has seconds to\nchoose which of her two children lives, which dies. Making her bludgeoned, unimaginable choice requires her frontocortical\nneurons to send signals to her prefrontal cortex and on to her motor cortex—after all, she eventually says words and moves\nher hands, pushing one child forward. And the bidirectionality of the circuitry is shown by the fact that her limbic system, no\ndoubt, was screaming in agony to the frontal cortex.\n\n883\n* Consider individuals with “repressive” personalities. Such individuals have highly regimented affect and behavior—they’re\nnot emotionally expressive and aren’t great at reading emotions in others. They like ordered, structured, predictable lives, can\ntell you what they’re having for dinner a week from Thursday, and complete everything on time. And they have elevated\nmetabolism in the frontal cortex and elevated circulating levels of stress hormones, showing that it can be enormously\nstressful to construct a world in which nothing stressful ever occurs.\n\n884\n* In humans activation of the dopaminergic system is typically assessed with functional imaging techniques like fMRI, which\ndetect changes in metabolism in different parts of the brain. To be precise, while an increase in metabolic demands in these\nregions is typically due to neurons there having lots of (dopamine-releasing) action potentials, the two are not synonymous.\nNonetheless, for simplicity I’m using “dopaminergic signaling increases,” “dopamine pathways activate,” “dopamine is\nreleased” interchangeably.\n\n885\n* And, in a fact that hints at a world of sex differences, dopaminergic responses to sexually arousing visual stimuli are greater\nin men than in women. Remarkably, this difference isn’t specific to humans. Male rhesus monkeys will forgo the chance to\ndrink water when thirsty in order to see pictures of—I’m not quite sure how else to say this—crotch shots of female rhesus\nmonkeys (while not being interested in other rhesus-y pictures).\n\n886\n* As an important point, study subjects were all female.\n\n887\n* Remarkably, in a gambling paradigm where both outcomes result in a shock, after a while, getting the lesser of the two\nshocks begins to activate dopamine signaling.\n\n888\n* The phenomenon reminds me of the terribly cynical observation of a dormmate in college, one with a long string of\ntumultuously disastrous relationships: “A relationship is the price you pay for the anticipation of it.”\n\n889\n* This fact prompted Greene, in a conversation with me, to dryly note how Harvard’s budget projections incorporate the\nexpectation that if they work hard enough, approximately 50 percent of junior faculty will receive tenure.\n\n890\n* And as a great example of the happiness of pursuit, where the rewarding quality of something is as much in the process as\nin the end product, the mesolimbic dopamine system plays a key role in motivating maternal care in female rats.\n\n891\n* Its name—raphe nucleus—is not essential.\n\n892\n* An urban legend has persisted forever that Skinner raised his daughter in a giant Skinner box, where she learned to lever\npress away for all her needs. Naturally, according to the legend, when she grew up she went mad, committed suicide, sued\nhim, tried to murder him, etc. All untrue.\n\n893\n* When I was in college, Skinner came to my dorm once for dinner and gave an extraordinarily dogmatic talk afterward. This\nproduced an odd thought on my part as I listened to him. “Wow, this guy is, like, a total Skinnerian.”\n\n894\n* It’s obvious which tribe I root for, being some manner of ethologist myself (but just to take this paean down a notch,\nremember that one of ethology’s founders was the odious Konrad Lorenz). In an inspired move, the three founders of\nethology—Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Karl von Frisch—were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973.\nThe biomedical community was appalled. Giving the prize to guys with foot fungi, whose main research technique was\nlooking through binoculars—what’s that got to do with medicine? Of the trio, Lorenz was the energetic self-promoter and\nflashy popularizer, Tinbergen, one of my heroes, was the deep thinker and amazing experimentalist, and von Frisch played\nelectric bass and didn’t say much.\n\n895\n* How would ethologists figure out what sensory information is pertinent to an animal? An example: Among gulls, the\nmother’s beak has a conspicuous red spot. When she brings food to the chicks, they peck at the beak, and Mom regurgitates\nthe food. Here’s how Tinbergen proved that the red spot triggers the pecking behavior: A subtraction approach, where he’d\npaint over the red spot on birds; chicks no longer pecked. A replication approach, where he’d take a two-by-four, paint a red\ndot on it, and wave it over the nest; chicks would start pecking. Or super stimulation, where he’d paint a gigantic red dot on\nthe mother’s beak; chicks would go berserk with the pecking. This approach now incorporates robotics, where ethologists\nhave built, for example, robotic bees that infiltrate and fiendishly deceive bee colonies by dancing about nonexistent food\nsources, which the bees then fly off in search of.\n\n896\n* A great example of interspecies cute responses: A significant factor in how much money people pledge to donate to help an\nendangered species is the relative size of the animal’s eyes. Big googly eyes loosen purse strings.\n\n897\n* Unconscious cues aren’t always about faces and posture. Among closely matched teams or individual male athletic\ncompetitors, wearing a red jersey boosts performance. This has been shown in Olympic boxing, tae kwon do, and wrestling,\nfor rugby and soccer teams, and when playing a virtual gladitorial computer game. It has been speculated to reflect the fact\nthat in many species (e.g., mandrill monkeys and widow birds) male dominance displays involve flashing a red body part,\nwhere more testosterone equals more intense red. I’m dubious about the explanation, as it feels like cherry-picking examples\nfrom other species.\n\n898\n* Findings like this should not be confused with the rationale behind the “Twinkie defense.” In 1978 San Francisco mayor\nGeorge Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk—the first openly gay politician in California—were assassinated by Dan\nWhite, a disgruntled ex-supervisor. According to the common misconception, during his trial, White’s defense attorneys\nargued that his addiction to sugary junk food somehow impaired his judgment and self-control. In reality, the defense argued\nthat White suffered from diminished capacity because of his depression, and his shift from a healthy diet to one of junk food\nwas merely evidence of his depressed state.\n\n899\n* One recent study demonstrates a pointed version of this—describing someone as “African American” evokes associations\nwith higher levels of education and income than does describing them as “black.”\n\n900\n* A recent study shows life-and-death consequences of linguistic cuing. For the same storm intensity, hurricanes arbitrarily\ngiven female names kill more people than do those with male names (names alternate between the two genders). Why?\nPeople unconsciously take male-named hurricanes more seriously and are more likely to comply with evacuation orders. And\nthis despite both male and female names being selected for their innocuousness—this isn’t comparing Hurricane Mary\nPoppins with Hurricane Vlad the Impaler.\n\n901\n* For a horrifying, documented example of bystanders being at least as callous as the apartment dwellers were reputed to be,\nGoogle the case of the death of two-year-old Wang Yue.\n\n902\n* In these studies the control situation is when subjects are in the presence of another man. And FYI, the presence of men has\nno such effects on the behavior of women.\n\n903\n* As an important point, this is indeed a case of acculturation, rather than a reflection of populational genetic differences—\nEast Asian Americans show the typical American pattern.\n\n904\n* This is no surprise to fans of the history of eunuchs, who were a mainstay of the military of Imperial China, prized as fierce\nsoldiers.\n\n905\n* One exception: Texas, where they still use a knife.\n\n906\n* Where, as with all these studies, neither the subjects nor the scientist observing them know whether the volunteers received\ntestosterone or placebo, and where the testosterone levels produced are always within the normal range.\n\n907\n* This is a rich literature showing the subtleties of the human psyche. The winning effect on testosterone is lessened in\ncircumstances where people feel like they won by luck or where, despite winning, they feel like they underperformed. In\ncontast, the effect is enhanced among people who went into the competition having the strongest psychological motives for\ndomination. Finally, testosterone levels can rise robustly in “losers” who nonetheless performed far better than they\nanticipated. Thus one might see testosterone levels rise after a marathon in a guy who came in at the back of the pack but is\ntriumphant because he was sure he was going to drop dead halfway through, and may decline in the guy who comes in third\nbut was expected to win. We all belong to numerous hierarchies, but some of the most powerful are the ones in our heads\nbased on our internal standards.\n\nthe way of various prosocial behaviors. For example, among monogamous birds and rodents, if testosterone levels don’t drop\naround the time the female gives birth, the males won’t act paternally. And some similar patterns seem to apply to humans:\nFathers have lower testosterone levels than age-matched, married men without children, and more involved fathers have\nlower levels than less involved ones. Moreover, evoking nurturing behavior in men lowers testosterone levels, as does the\nbirth of a man’s child. And when compared with high-testosterone fathers, those with lower average testosterone levels are\n909\n* In studies like these, this is typically accomplished either with the administration of a drug that blocks oxytocin receptors or\nwith genetic engineering techniques to eliminate the gene for oxytocin or for the oxytocin receptor.\n\n910\n* In other words, a familiar theme: vasopressin doesn’t cause paternal behavior; it facilitates it in species that are already\npredisposed to it.\n\n911\n* This turned out to be due to a genetic difference between the two species. Interestingly, it is not a difference in the DNA\nsequence that constitutes the gene for the vasopressin receptor. It is a difference in the sequence that constitutes the on/off\nswitch for the gene. More on this in chapter 8.\n\n912\n* This generated all sorts of caustic discussions at conferences as to whether this constituted a case of “gene transfer” (i.e.,\nthe value-neutral process of transferring a novel gene into an individual in order to alter a function) or “gene therapy” (i.e.,\ntransferring a gene in order to cure those montane males of the disease of infidelity). It strikes me that if that research had\nbeen carried out instead at Berkeley during the Summer of Love in 1967, the gene-therapy goal would have been to make\nprairie voles transcend their Middle American bourgeois genetics and become polygamous. The times, they are a changin’ to\nquote a recent Nobel Laureate.\n\n913\n* Note that the entire romantic coupling literature I just discussed solely concerns heterosexual couples. As far as I know,\nvery little has been studied in this realm with gay or lesbian subjects.\n\n914\n* Discriminating online shoppers can now buy “Liquid Trust,” touted as “the world’s first oxytocin pheromone product.”\nPerhaps worse, perfectly straitlaced scientific publications have referred to oxytocin as the “love drug” or the “cuddle drug.”\nThe “cuddle” part is puzzling, since the literature is about oxytocin-laden prairie voles huddling, not cuddling, and the former\ndoesn’t evoke images of luv-fests as much as of tubercular huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\n\n915\n* For the truly interested, the gene codes for a protein called CD38, which facilitates oxytocin secretion from neurons.\n\n916\n* In the Prisoner’s Dilemma each of the two players must decide whether to cooperate. If they both cooperate, they each get,\nsay, two units of reward. If they both backstab, they each get one unit. If one cooperates and the other backstabs, the cheater\ngets three units and the stooge gets none.\n\n917\n* The IAT will be described in detail in a later chapter—briefly, the test takes advantage of the fact that it takes us\nmilliseconds longer to process pairings of information that seem discordant than pairings that make sense; thus if you’re\nprejudiced against group X, it takes you longer to process a pairing of group X with a positive term—for example,\n“wonderful”—than with a negative term—“dangerous.”\n\n918\n* Maternal aggression involves the amygdala; no surprise there. But (harking back to chapter 1 and its discussion of the\nheterogeneity of types of aggression) it is also uniquely and crucially dependent on a tiny brain region that hasn’t been\nmentioned before, the ventral premammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n\n919\n* The next two paragraphs can be skipped if you already have enough complications in your life.\n\n920\n* Called allopregnanolone.\n\n921\n* Hyenas have a terrible reputation, thanks to outdated zoology that characterizes them, sneeringly, as “scavengers”\n(snarkiness that makes little sense, given that most of us just scavenge dead stuff in the supermarket). Rather than living off\nthe scraps of lions’ kills, they are highly effective hunters. Most often, it is scavenging lions trying to drive hyenas off a kill,\nrather than the other way around. And real hyenas don’t sing inane songs like in The Lion King.\n\n922\n* Think about this: Among typical mammals, when males are terrified, they lose erections. Among hyenas, that’s when they\nget one (and when some moth-eaten male has the chance to mate, he’s probably terrified out of his mind). This implies some\nvery different wiring of the autonomic nervous system, whereby stress promotes rather than inhibits erections.\n\n923\n* More than two thousand years ago Aristotle, for reasons obscure to even the most learned, dissected some dead hyenas,\ndiscussing them in his treatise Historia Animalium, VI, XXX. He drew the incorrect conclusion that these animals were\nhermaphrodites, possessing all the machinery of both sexes.\n\n924\n* This leads us to another great factoid from the hyena world. If a low-ranking female is being menaced by a high-ranking\none, the subordinate gets a clitoral erection—“Please don’t hurt me; look, I’m just like one of those bedraggled, innocuous\nmales.”\n\n925\n* This is due to an obscure hormone called DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) that is converted to an androgen within only\ncertain neurons, and, even stranger, some of those neurons even synthesize their own androgens.\n\n926\n* Many people more properly think of PMS as perimenstrual syndrome, in that the symptoms occur typically not just before\nthe onset of menses, but for a few days after as well.\n\n927\n* Mead has been savaged by later generations of Oceanic anthropologists for having painted a grossly inaccurate picture of\nSamoa as the Garden of Eden, in part because of her ideological desire to see Samoa that way, and in part because the\nSamoans had a grand time making things up and then gleefully watching the starry-eyed white lady fall for it hook, line, and\nsinker.\n\n928\n* This literature also has produced sentences like “Such a symbolic analysis is consistent with the hermeneutic, meaning-\ncentered focus of the ‘new cross-cultural psychiatry.’” I haven’t a clue what in hell that means.\n\n929\n* For example, the “fusiform face area” is more responsive to faces in ovulating women than in those menstruating.\nSimilarly, the “emotional” vmPFC is more responsive to men’s faces when women are approaching ovulation than when they\nare approaching menses; the higher the ratio of estrogen to progesterone in the bloodstream during that preovulatory phase,\nthe more vmPFC responsiveness. Finally, women find faces of men judged to look “aggressive” to be more attractive when\nthey are ovulating.\n\n930\n* The broad question of what this book’s avalanche of information says about criminal justice will be considered in chapter\n16. I thank Dylan Alegria, a research assistant of mine, for superb assistance in reviewing the PMS/criminality literature.\n\n931\n* For real aficionados: In recent years “homeostasis” has been expanded and fancified into the new, elegant concept of\n“allostasis.” Most basically, it incorporates the fact that an ideal homeostatic set point in the body varies dramatically\ndepending on the circumstance.\n\n932\n* More info for aficionados: The suppression of immunity and inflammation during chronic stress is caused by\nglucocorticoids. This is the reason why glucocorticoids are used to suppress the immune system in people with an overactive\nimmune system (i.e., an autoimmune disease), to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ, or to suppress an overactive\ninflammatory response. This is what happens when people are put on immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory “steroids” like\ncortisone or prednisone (two synthetic glucocorticoids).\n\n933\n* How does the brain pull off an inverted U, where a moderate rise in glucocorticoid levels enhances memory (for example),\nwhile a bigger rise does the opposite? One solution that the brain has evolved is to have two receptor systems for\nglucocorticoids. One (the “MR”) is responsive to small increases in glucocorticoid levels above baseline and mediates the\nstimulatory effects. The other (“GR”) receptors respond only to big, prolonged increases and mediate the adverse effects.\nPredictably, levels of the two types of receptors vary by brain region, person, and circumstance.\n\n934\n* As just stated, stress increases overall excitability in the amygdala. This involves the inhibition of particular neurons—\nnamely the inhibitory GABA interneurons. Inhibiting the inhibitors in the circuit causes the activity of the big, excitatory\nglutamate-releasing neurons to increase.\n\n935\n* Plus, more obscurely, via the sympathetic nervous system indirectly activating the amygdala by way of that norepinephrine-\nreleasing projection into it from the locus coeruleus (the brain-stem region that was mentioned briefly in chapter 2—its\nactivation leads to arousal throughout the brain).\n\n936\n* And the underlying neurobiology is probably similar to what is going on in those other realms of poor decision making\nduring stress, e.g., eating or drinking more.\n\n937\n* The test is a standard in the field called the Trier Social Stress Test, which is a fifteen-minute combination of a mock job\ninterview and a mental arithmetic task, both carried out in front of a panel of stone-faced evaluators.\n\n938\n* Note that these are studies about what people say they would do, not what they actually do. The difference between the two\nwill be considered in chapter 13, when considering moral reasoning versus moral action.\n\n939\n* Okay, that was a juvenile cheap shot thrown in merely to increase the number of moose buying copies of this book.\n\n940\n* Although nothing was known about NMDA and non-NMDA receptors at the time.\n\n941\n* Where do more copies of the receptors come from? Miles away from that dendritic spine, in the center of that neuron, is the\nnucleus, containing the DNA, which includes genes coding for glutamate receptors. Somehow the nucleus needs to hear that\na calcium wave occurred in one dendritic spine in the boondocks. The nucleus then directs the synthesis of more copies of the\nreceptor, which are then shipped to that specific spine, out of the neuron’s ten thousand. That’s insanely hard. Typically,\ninstead, there are extra glutamate receptors mothballed inside dendritic spines, and the calcium tidal wave is the signal that\npulls them onto the spine’s membrane.\n\n942\n* For aficionados, the non-NMDA receptors are “phosphorylated,” which causes their sodium channels to stay open longer.\n\n943\n* Actually, LTP in the spinal cord has more to do with “neuropathic” pain, syndromes where a severe injury causes all sorts\nof nonnoxious stimuli to start hurting chronically—in effect, your spine has “learned” to always feel pain. Interestingly, such\nLTP arises in part from the inflammation that accompanies the initial injury.\n\n944\n* The mechanisms underlying LTP elsewhere in the nervous system often differ from those of hippocampal LTP—some\ninvolve a third class of glutamate receptors; some may not even involve glutamate. The LTP old guard has generally coped\nwith the indignity of LTP outside the hippocampus by viewing the hippocampal kind as classical, canonical, textbook, divine,\netc., and the rest as chintzy knockoffs.\n\n945\n* Equally remarkably, over the course of the menstrual cycle in humans, the amount of myelin in the corpus callosum, the\nmassive bundle of axons that connects the two hemispheres, fluctuates as well.\n\n946\n* Not all remapping is logical; some is just plain weird. A few years back, during an extremely stressed period, I developed a\ntic—when I’d be acutely upset about something, the second and third fingers on my left hand would rhythmically contract for\na few seconds. What the hell was that about? No idea, but I marvel at the randomness of the remapping, at how unpleasant\ntumult in limbic circuitry somehow tapped into this motor circuit.\n\n947\n* Nottebohm, interviewed in an excellent New Yorker piece recounting this history, said, “Pasko has taken on the role of hard-\nnosed defender of standards. And that’s fine—it’s even warranted. . . . [But] as much as I hate to say this, I think Pasko Rakic\nsingle-handedly held the field of neurogenesis back by at least a decade.”\n\n948\n* The fact that brain injury, such as a stroke, triggers neurogenesis created huge excitement—wow, the brain has a means to\ntry to repair itself after an injury, how cool is that? What was obvious from the start is that whatever compensatory\nneurogenesis there is, there isn’t a ton, since so many neurological insults leave the nervous system an irreparable mess\nafterward. But to add insult to injury, work in that area began to show that sometimes the new neurons actually made things\nworse, migrating where they shouldn’t, integrating into circuits the wrong way, making those circuits seizure prone. To\nmetaphorically appropriate a concept from chapter 1, this seems a case of neuronal pathological altruism—beware when\nfreshly minted neurons that may not yet know feces from Shinola want to lend a helping hand.\n\n949\n* Listing these various factors that “enhance” or “inhibit” neurogenesis glosses over lots of detail. The number of new\nneurons that are integrated into circuits reflects (a) the number of new cells that are formed from stem cells in the brain; (b)\nthe percentage of new cells that differentiate into neurons (as opposed to glial cells); and (c) the rate at which new neurons\nsurvive and form functional synapses. Each of these manipulations—learning, exercise, stress, etc.—targets different steps.\nComplicating things further is the fact that not all stressors are equal. If a rodent secretes glucocorticoids because it thinks\nthere is a predator around and the fight-or-flight sirens are going off, neurogenesis is inhibited. But if it secretes\nglucocorticoids while voluntarily running in a running wheel, it enhances neurogenesis (in other words, the contrast between\n“bad” and “good” stress).\n\n950\n* As one additional, grim piece of this picture of neural plasticity, extremes of chronic stress and glucocorticoid overexposure\ncan also kill hippocampal neurons. While this is probably pertinent to nightmare extremes of stress, it is unclear how relevant\nit might be to more garden-variety sustained stress.\n\n951\n* For example, the phenomenon where experience can turn the on/off switch on a gene in a particular direction used to be\nconsidered permanent; that is turning out not to be the case. Similarly, the hippocampal atrophy in Cushing’s syndrome\nappears to reverse within a year or so after the tumor is removed. As one disturbing exception to this theme, most studies\nsuggest that the atrophy of the hippocampus with long-term major depression persists after the depression is successfully\ntreated. Moreover, the reversibility of some of these effects (for example, of stress-induced retraction of dendritic processes)\ndecreases with age.\n\n952\n* The delayed attainment of legal adulthood in the West also sometimes reflected something as mundane as muscle mass. In\nthirteenth-century England the age of legal majority was raised from fifteen to twenty-one years—protective armor was\ngetting heavier, and it wasn’t until the older age that males were typically strong enough to comport themselves in armor on\nthe battlefield. There is no mention as to whether the age of majority of the horses carrying these heavier weights was raised\nas well. But sometimes technological advancements have made it possible for younger adolescents to join the ranks of adult\noccupations—it has been pointed out that the development of lightweight automatic weapons has been a boon for the\nusefulness of the estimated 300,000 child soldiers on earth.\n\n953\n* Not to mention the idea that adults should aspire to still be adolescent in many ways—to retain or regain adolescent tastes\nfor novelty and sociality, adolescent levels of hair on the head and cellulite in the thighs, and adolescent refractory periods.\nHunter-gatherers aren’t interested in “Look ten years younger!” They want to look like elders, so they can boss everyone\naround.\n\n954\n* Not surprisingly, the peak of frontal cortical gray matter comes earlier in girls than in boys. Beyond that, what is most\nstriking is the lack of major sex differences in the trajectory of adolescent brain development.\n\n955\n* An interesting exception is that adolescents do not have particularly strong responses to disgusting stimuli, either on a\nsubjective level or on the level of insular cortex activation.\n\n956\n* With frontal regulation of emotions emerging later in males than females.\n\n957\n* With the peak of sensation seeking coming and going earlier in females than in males.\n\n958\n* What this doesn’t explain is why, for example, it’s males who leave among baboons and females who do among chimps,\nnor does it explain why novelty seeking varies among humans. That will be touched on obliquely in chapter 10.\n\n959\n* Studies using this Cyberball paradigm typically have an important control group: The subject is in the same three-way\ngame of virtual catch when they are told, “Oops, there is a computer glitch. We’ve lost contact with the other two players.\nHang out in there while we fix this.” While things are being “fixed,” the other two players toss the ball. In other words, the\nperson is left out, but because of technical problems, not for social reasons. And none of those brain regions activate. (Mind\nyou, if it were me when in a less secure state of mind, it would certainly cross my mind that by the time that computer glitch\nwas fixed, the other two would have already bonded and realized they were happier without me as part of the game and\nwould continue to exclude me or, if they started throwing the ball back to me, would be doing so out of sheer condescension,\nthereby causing my mesolimbic dopamine system to instantly atrophy.)\n\n960\n* The inventory requires the person to indicate the extent to which various statements tapping into social conformity apply to\nthem—“Some people go along with their friends just to keep their friends happy,” “Some people say things they don’t really\nbelieve because they think it will make their friends respect them more,” and so on.\n\n961\n* Some readers will recognize that those premotor neurons that start to imitate the movement being observed are “mirror\nneurons.” As will be seen in a later chapter, the mirror neuron system is fascinating, amid enormous amounts of hype.\n\n962\n* I have not seen any studies that look at maturational sophistication about circumstances where harm to an object produces\nenormous emotional harm to individuals—for example, the destruction of religious relics. As will be covered in a later\nchapter, there is vast power to such symbolic objects.\n\n963\n* How do you demonstrate object permanence in a preverbal infant? Show a child who is not yet at this stage a stuffie, which\nyou then place in a box. For her, the stuffie no longer exists. Now take it out, and she thinks, “OMG, where’d that stuffie\ncome from?” Her heart rate increases. Once the kid masters object permanence, pull the stuffie out of the box and (yawn) “Of\ncourse that’s where you put the stuffie”—no heart-rate increase. Even better: put the stuffie in a box and then pull something\ndifferent (say, a ball) out of the box. Pre-object-permanence kid isn’t surprised—the stuffie stopped existing, and the ball just\ncame into existence. Older kid with object permanence: “Wait, that stuffie turned into a ball!”—heart rate increases.\n\n964\n* How would you test this? Two humans stand in front of a monkey, one blindfolded. A treat for the monkey is hidden\nsomewhere. Blindfold is removed; monkey chooses which human goes to look for the treat. “Don’t choose the one who was\nblindfolded. They don’t know where the treat is,” thinks the ToM Master of the Universe monkey.\n\n965\n* This “sensory motor resonance” might bring “mirror neurons” to mind. Chapter 14 examines what mirror neurons do (often\nin sharp contrast to what they’ve been speculated to do). The involvement of the PAG also brings to mind sociopaths, with\ntheir lack of capacity for empathy; as discussed in chapter 2, such individuals have atypically blunted pain perception.\n\n966\n* The paper by Decety mentioned in the previous chapter had another interesting finding: For acts that harm people, the\ntypical adult pattern is to advocate greater punishment for intentional acts. There is far less distinction made between\nintentional and unintentional when it comes to harm to objects. “Damn, I don’t care if he meant to Krazy Glue the fan belt or\nnot—we have to buy a new one.”\n\n967\n* “Greater good” for kids, as at any age, is in the eye of the beholder. In psychologist Robert Coles’s classic The Moral Life\nof Children (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1986), he describes his fieldwork in the American South during\ndesegregation, and how older children on both sides of the divide were willing to undergo sacrifice for the good of their\nideological group.\n\n968\n* I once received a lesson in kids’ private world of rule making from my then-four-year-old son. We had gone to a public\nbathroom together; we stood side by side at two urinals, and I finished a bit earlier than he did. “I wish we had finished at the\nsame time,” he said. Why? “We get more points that way.”\n\n969\n* The callous aggression speaks to another childhood predictor of adult sociopathy, namely abuse of animals.\n\n970\n* I haven’t a clue whether that should apply to Floyd, the Depression-era bank robber (and murderer) who nonetheless\nbecame somewhat of a folk hero to the poor, and whose Oklahoma funeral was attended by somewhere between twenty\nthousand and forty thousand people.\n\n971\n* A recent study adds an important twist to this story. There are the kids with problems with impulse control—“I’m\nabsolutely going to hold out for two marshmallow”—who then instantly eat that first one. That profile is a statistical predictor\nof adult violent crime. In contrast, there are kids with steep time-discounting curves—“Wait fifteen minutes for two\nmarshmallows when I can have one right now? What kind of fool waits fifteen minutes?” That is a predictor of adult property\ncrime.\n\n972\n* Bowlby, unlike most Freudians and behaviorists, actually had extensive experience with children, including children in the\n1940s separated from their mothers—London children sent to the countryside during the Blitz, Central European Jewish\nchildren shipped to England in the Kindertransport rescues one step ahead of Hitler, and of course war orphans. BTW, what\nwas Bowlby’s childhood like? He was the son of Sir Anthony Bowlby, the king’s own surgeon, and was raised by nannies.\n\n973\n* Naturally, by now Bowlby’s offspring, the school of “attachment parenting,” is so established as to have generated endless\nmisconceptions, fads, cults, lunatic fringes, and crazy-making senses of neurotic inadequacy or self-righteous superiority\namong parents. To open a can of worms a smidgen, there is no scientific support for concluding that a woman has irreparably\ndamaged her child if she does not breast-feed, breast-feeds for less than the first decade of the child’s life, can’t successfully\nbreast-feed her child within seconds after birth, or ever leaves the child alone for more than two seconds, let alone works\noutside of the house. And nothing about the science says that the same good effects of attachment can’t be provided by a\nman, a working single mother, two mommies, or two daddies.\n\n974\n* The iconic nature of this study is such that I’ve heard psychologists sardonically reference Harlow, as in, “I had a pretty\ncrappy childhood; my father was never around and my mother was a chicken-wire mom.”\n\n975\n* Interestingly, Bowlby’s first published paper reported that thieves had an increased rate of extended maternal separation in\nchildhood. Related to that, a 1994 study showed that individuals who suffered the combination of birth complications and\nmaternal rejection at age one had a markedly increased likelihood of committing violent (but not nonviolent) crimes eighteen\nyears later.\n\n976\n* The brutality of these studies helped spawn the animal-rights movement. I’ve been deeply conflicted about Harlow’s work\nsince I was first moved to tears reading about it as a teenager. He was appallingly callous, readily admitted that he felt\nnothing for the monkeys, and did too many of the deprivation studies. But at the same time, the work helped, among other\nthings, lay the groundwork for understanding the biology of how early-life loss predisposes toward adult depression. Given\nthe prevailing wisdom at the time concerning child rearing and the perceived irrelevance of features of parenting that we now\nview as vital, the irony is that it was Harlow’s pioneering work that most clearly demonstrated the immorality of doing such\nresearch.\n\n977\n* For example, early-childhood lead exposure—a strong correlate of living in a poor neighborhood—impairs brain\ndevelopment and predicts poor cognitive and emotional regulatory skills and increased incidence of criminality in adulthood.\n\n978\n* What’s anhedonia like in a rat? Give a normal rat two water bottles to choose from, one with water, the other with water\nsweetened with sucrose. The rat prefers the sucrose water. But a stressed, anhedonic rat shows no preference. Same result for\nother pleasurable things.\n\n979\n* Remarkably, exposure to multiple incidents of violence even accelerates the aging of children’s chromosomes.\n\n980\n* I want to thank a really excellent undergrad, Dylan Alegria, who helped me tread water in this voluminous literature.\n\n981\n* I thank another superb undergrad, Ali Maggioncalda, for help with this topic.\n\n982\n* A shocking part of the story: Roma children were regularly abandoned at orphanages and left there until they were\nadolescents—and could work.\n\n983\n* An irresistible irony: In the aftermath of the book’s publication, Harris received a major award from the august American\nPsychological Association, an award named in honor of . . . the man who, decades before, as chairman of the psychology\ndepartment at Harvard, had thrown Harris out of the PhD program for her lack of potential.\n\n984\n* All of these differences are typical in fathers as well but have been studied far more in mothers.\n\n985\n* I’ve experienced a manifestation of such parenting in my decades of fieldwork in Kenya, where my nearest neighbors have\nbeen highly un-Westernized members of the Maasai tribe. Sometimes I’d run into someone I hadn’t seen in a while who had\nhad a baby in the interim, and it took me years to get out of my ridiculous Western reflex—“A new baby! That’s wonderful!\nMazel tov! What’s her name?” Awkward silence—you don’t give a baby a name (or perhaps aren’t willing to utter it) until\nshe’s survived her first malarial rainy season and hungry dry season.\n\n986\n* Which, as noted by Kusserow, included the largest percentage of fathers who were willing to be interviewed.\n\n987\n* I once got a poignant reminder of just how permeating the consequences of lack of privilege are in my professional world. I\nwas interviewing candidates for a position in my lab. In the process, I’d ask each person about how they handled\ninterpersonal conflict, looking for people who promptly addressed a social tension, rather than letting it fester into passive-\naggressiveness. I was interviewing a guy whose background was in Queens, rather than the Upper East Side. And when\nasked, instead of giving the Upper East Side answer I hoped for (“Yeah, I know how bad things get when you don’t\ncommunicate; I’d be pretty good at just asking the person to be considerate and please return my pipette when they borrow\nit”), I got the correct answer from Queens: “Nope, no problems there. I know that a lab is no place for fighting; you take it\noutside. You’ve got nothing to worry about with me.”\n\n988\n* In contrast, newborns recognize but show no preference for their father’s voice.\n\n989\n* This view held in most medical circles for many years afterward. For an example of how wrong that approach can be, see\nJohn Colapinto, As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl (New York: Harper Perennial, 2006).\n\n990\n* Remarkably, studies have examined brains of transgender individuals, concentrating on brain regions that, on the average,\ndiffer in size between men and women. And consistently, regardless of the desired direction of the sex change and, in fact,\nregardless of whether the person had undergone a sex change yet, the dimorphic brain regions in transgender individuals\nresembled the sex of the person they had always felt themselves to be, not their “actual” sex. In other words, it’s not the case\nthat transgender individuals think they’re a different gender than they actually are. It’s more like they got stuck with the\nbodies of a different sex from who they actually are.\n\n991\n* Prenatal screening for CAH is now possible, and the fetal masculinization can be prevented to some extent with fetal\nhormone treatments. This has been framed by some clinicians as a means to increase the odds of a CAH female having a\nheterosexual orientation, something that has drawn the ire of bioethicists and the LGBTQ community.\n\n992\n* Meanwhile, there is no consistent evidence that the extent of androgen exposure in the hours to weeks after birth predicts\nanything about subsequent behavior.\n\n993\n* Why not “determines” instead of “influences”? Because the female’s body can convert one nutrient into another before\npassing it to the fetus.\n\n994\n* Third-trimester malnutrition also alters aspects of physiology, so that the fetus has a lifelong increased risk of diabetes,\nobesity, and metabolic syndrome, something known as the “Dutch Hunger Winter effect.”\n\n995\n* FYI, the gene that codes for the glucocorticoid receptor.\n\n996\n* The next chapter discusses how this nongenetic but rather epigenetic transmission of traits multigenerationally resembles a\nlong-discredited idea about acquired inheritance proposed by the eighteenth-century scientist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.\n\n997\n* Note: This does not mean that every neuron in the frontal cortex had the regulation of a thousand-odd genes changed.\nInstead, there are glial cells in addition to neurons, and the neurons are of a variety of types. So in reality the average number\nof changes within any given cell was probably far less than a thousand. Note about note: which doesn’t make any of this less\ninteresting, just harder to study.\n\n998\n* The strongest ideological criticisms of genetics have typically been leftist in flavor. Despite that, and to my surprise, the one\nstudy I know of that has examined the subject showed no Left/Right ideological differences in the tendency to attribute\nindividual differences to genetics. Where they differ concerns what sorts of differences are attributed. Thus right-wing\nideology is more associated with genetic interpretations for race or class differences, while left-wing ideology is more\nassociative when it comes to sexual orientation.\n\npsychological impact of the murder spree was enormous). In August 1977 it ended with the arrest of David Berkowitz, a\ntwenty-three-year-old petty criminal and arsonist who claimed that he killed under the command of a neighbor’s dog, said\ndog ostensibly being demonically possessed. A month later, back at college, the phone rang. My roommate answered and\nhanded me the phone, looking a bit puzzled. “It’s your mother; she seems kind of excited.” “Hi, Mom, what’s new?” And in a\neuphoric, relieved, triumphant tone, she shouted: “David Berkowitz! He’s adopted. Adopted! HE’S NOT REALLY\n1000\n* Terminology: A gene is “transcribed” when the RNA template of its DNA sequence is made, which is then used to generate\nthe protein that it codes for.\n\n1001\n* Note that “junk” DNA may be junk or, more likely, DNA whose function hasn’t been discovered yet. There are reasons to\ngo with the latter interpretation.\n\n1002\n* There are related stretches of noncoding DNA that are part of on/off switches called enhancers and operators. For our\npurposes, we’ll just use the term promoters.\n\n1003\n* Or to use other jargon in the field, when it is “activated” or “expressed”—I’ll use these terms interchangeably.\n\n1004\n* For those who care, the number of unique transcriptional profiles for n number of genes is (2n)−1, not counting the state\nwhere no genes are being transcribed. So plug the approximately 20,000 human genes into the equation, and you get a\ngargantuan number of possible transcriptional profiles.\n\n1005\n* “Epigenetic” technically refers to altering the regulation of genes, rather than the sequence of genes. Therefore a\ntranscription factor activating some gene for ten minutes counts as epigenetic as well. When neuroscientists talk of the\n“epigenetics revolution,” however, they’re almost always referring to the long-lasting mechanisms discussed here.\n\n1006\n* Note that Lamarck was talking about the concept of species evolution long before Darwin and Wallace. The latter two\ndidn’t invent the idea of evolution; rather, they figured out how evolution works, namely by natural selection.\n\n1007\n* And as a brilliant counterstrategy, some parasites use transposons to shuffle the DNA coding for their surface proteins every\nfew weeks. In other words, just as the infected host is building up stocks of antibody to recognize the surface protein, the\nparasite switches identities, making the host immune system start all over.\n\n1008\n* There have even been reports of heritability of intelligence in chimpanzees.\n\n1009\n* I was pleased to see this study. Numerous studies, stretching back decades, have attempted to uncover the biological roots\nof sexual orientation; the earlier literature overwhelmingly came with the political agenda of trying to figure out what is\nbiologically “wrong” with homosexuals. Thus, it was about time for people to study what’s wrong with homophobes.\n\n1010\n* Yeah, I’m shorter than average.\n\n1011\n* Historically, the most hyperoxygenated criticisms of behavioral genetics as a discipline have come from nongeneticists\nquestioning the motives and hidden sociopolitical agendas behind behavior genetics findings. It is historically justified to\nconclude this at many junctures; however, it’s utterly inapplicable to the behavior geneticists I know. The next chapter will\nlook at a related version of a “there’s a hidden agenda” controversy.\n\n1012\n* And roughly similar conclusions can be reached concerning end points like weight, height, BMI, and various metabolic\nmeasures.\n\n1013\n* Whether MZ twins wind up as mono- or dichorionic depends on when the new embryo divides.\n\n1014\n* Not always—there are some truly weird mechanisms of gene transmission involving “imprinted genes” that violate this, but\nwe’re ignoring that.\n\n1015\n* I thank an excellent student assistant, Katrina Hui, for help in this area.\n\n1016\n* Although many purists in the field would say that we don’t actually inherit a trait; we inherit the material needed to\nconstruct a trait.\n\n1017\n* This next section has been heavily influenced by the writings of the geneticists Richard Lewontin of Harvard and David\nMoore of Pitzer College and the science writer Matt Ridley.\n\n1018\n* Genetics savants will note that I’ve simplified things here by ignoring heterozygosity; it doesn’t matter.\n\n1019\n* Here’s a cool example pointed out to me by a colleague, Bud Ruby. All those twin studies generate heritability scores,\nindicating the strength of genes in explaining individual variation. But those studies, by definition, have eliminated an\nimportant nongenetic source of variation—birth order.\n\n1020\n* There has been some controversy about the replicability of this immensely important observation, and I’ve followed it\nclosely. When considering only the carefully done studies with adequate sample sizes and clearly and narrowly defined end\npoints, I believe that it’s been amply replicated.\n\n1021\n* A subtle point for which I thank Stephen Manuck of the University of Pittsburgh: This example represents an exception to\nthe rule that heritability scores go down as you study a trait in more environments. If you started by studying only low-SES\nindividuals, you’d generate a very low heritability score (~10 percent). Thus, if one studies both low- and high-SES subjects\n(the latter with a high heritability score of about 70 percent), the score will rise.\n\n1022\n* Harking back to how the noncoding regulatory regions of the genome are at least as important as regions that code for\ngenes themselves, the 5HTT variants do not differ in the DNA sequence of the gene but rather in the sequence of a promoter\nfor the gene. As a result, the two variants differ in their sensitivity to a transcription factor, and thus in the amount of\ntransporter protein made.\n\n1023\n* Again, the variation in the DNA sequence was not in the MAO-A gene but in its promoter.\n\n1024\n* Part of what may explain the “warrior gene” frothiness is the “aggressive” variant being found at a high rate among Maori\npopulations and traditional Maori culture having very high rates of warfare. Nonetheless, it is far from the case that every\nMaori individual with the “warrior” variant is highly aggressive, or that every highly aggressive Maori has the warrior\nvariant.\n\n1025\n* Control subjects had the task of unscrambling jumbled strings of words into coherent phrases. The religion-prime group did\nthe same with word strings that contained religious terms.\n\n1026\n* For aficionados: The testosterone receptor contains what is called a polyglutamine repeat—a stretch of the protein where\nthe same amino acid, called glutamine, is repeated. Importantly, there is tremendous variability among people as to how many\nglutamine repeats there are; the fewer, the more potently the androgen receptor works. Recall that receptors for steroid\nhormones like testosterone work as transcription factors, and proteins that have polyglutamine repeats are often transcription\nfactors.\n\n1027\n* And, following that logic, if a trait associates with a particular version of an SNP in the promoter of a gene, you’ve just\ngotten a hint that the regulation of the gene (as opposed to the gene itself) may be involved in that trait. As an example, the\ngene for one type of serotonin receptor contains an SNP in the third base of the codon coding for the thirty-fourth amino acid\nin the protein, and one of the variants of that SNP is associated with responsiveness to a particular drug in schizophrenics.\n\n1028\n* For lovers of details: Note that the GWAS and microarray approaches are usually telling different things. In the former you\nare looking for genes that have a variant that is associated with whatever disease or behavior you’re studying. In microarray\nstudies you’re looking for genes whose expression profiles are associated with the disease or behavior.\n\n1029\n* More scientific lingo—pass a big fishing net through a stretch of the ocean, and see what you wind up catching.\n\n1030\n* This would be if there is a gene that has an SNP that is unbelievably powerfully associated with something, but the alternate\nletter only occurs in a thousand humans. That will be missed with current GWAS.\n\n1031\n* Note that the other reliable sex difference in cognition, namely better reading performance by girls than by boys, doesn’t\ndisappear in more gender-equal societies. It gets bigger.\n\n1032\n* In reading about Americans versus East Asians in this section, and Americans versus other cultures in later sections, you’ll\nrealize that in some ways it’s Americans (and Western Europeans) versus the rest of the world in many cultural ways. They\nare just plain “WEIRD”—Westernized, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.\n\n1033\n* These are tough studies to pull off, as neuroimaging is a bit of an art in addition to a science, and being able to\nquantitatively compare data derived from two scanners and scanning protocols on opposite sides of the globe is challenging.\nThe alternative—having subjects from both cultures studied in the same scanner—is challenging as well; those aren’t going\nto be representative subjects, since half of them are probably international students—connected, well off, and adventurous\nenough to be in an American college town, volunteering for a Psych 101 study.\n\n1034\n* The United States was not without labor-intensive agriculture historically. But rather than solving that with collectivism, it\nsolved it with slavery.\n\n1035\n* I have no idea if rice roots actually run deep, but the metaphor was begging to be written.\n\n1036\n* Obviously, no individual actually migrated that far—the slow creep of migration southward in the Western Hemisphere\ntook millennia.\n\n1037\n* For genetics fans with more of a background than chapter 8, the near-zero incidence of 7R means that in these cultures\nthere isn’t even any benefit to heterozygous versions of 7R.\n\n1038\n* As noted earlier, within a few generations of immigration, East Asian Americans are typically as individualist as European\nAmericans. This raises the question of whether East Asians who chose to immigrate had a higher frequency of 7R than East\nAsians in general (one might also wonder whether there is a higher incidence of 7R in the wheat-growing regions of China\nthan in the rice districts). Unfortunately, according to Kenneth Kidd, no one knows about either.\n\n1039\n* Another striking difference in gene variant frequencies concerns the gene coding for the serotonin transporter, which\nremoves serotonin from the synapse and which, as we saw in the last chapter, is associated with impulsive aggression in\nvastly confusing ways. One variant of the gene is associated with negative emotion, an attentional bias toward negative\nstimuli, anxiety, and depression risk when coupled with stressful risk factors. Its incidence is less than 50 percent worldwide\nbut 70 to 80 percent in East Asian populations.\n\n1040\n* I once got to experience what this looks like for an extended stretch, as I traveled with a group of Somalis who were driving\nempty gasoline tankers back from Sudan to the Indian Ocean in Kenya for refilling. At the end of each day of driving through\nthe desert, we’d sit around a campfire between the trucks, cooking a pot of spaghetti and camel’s milk. (Why that particular\ncombo? That’s a whole other story. . . .) And inevitably one of the six Somalis would do something that was perceived as\ninsulting by someone. There would be snarling, angry words, knives drawn from boots, two guys circling and lunging at each\nother until everyone else roused themselves to get the two to settle down. And then, the hospitality flip side of the culture on\ndisplay, everyone would hurry over to make sure I got the best of the spaghetti/milk glob. “Eat, eat. You are our brother,”\nthey’d say, including whichever two had just been slashing at each other.\n\n1041\n* Well, whether the feud actually ended in the 1890s is open to interpretation. While the families declared a truce and stopped\nthe killings in 1891, their descendants battled for a week in 1979 on the game show Family Feud. The McCoys won three of\nthe five games, while the Hatfields won more money.\n\n1042\n* What’s antisocial punishment about? The general interpretation is that people are being punished for being generous\nbecause they make everyone else look bad and increase the expectation of generosity from everyone else.\n\n1043\n* Ironic footnote: when coach passengers board through first class, the rate of air rage related to a sense of entitlement\nincreases even more among the first-class passengers.\n\n1044\n* The paper generated an astonishing number of articles in the lay press whose titles were variants on “Stress and the City.”\n\n1045\n* The online world is now undergoing cultural evolution, wrestling with how to deal with the toxic behavior of some people\nonline when they are shielded behind anonymity. Psychologists are even doing experiments, gifted with mammoth databases,\nto see how best to curb such behavior with top-down approaches (e.g., being banned by authorities) and interventions driven\nby peers (i.e., other players).\n\n1046\n* And there are remarkable similarities among such moralizing religions.\n\n1047\n* The authors used math straight out of chemistry for analyzing the extent of mixing between different types of solutions,\nplus some math from physics usually used to disentangle the contributions made by overlapping waves. I understood exactly\nzero of any of this and am putting faith in the vetting process of the journal, Science, the most selective science journal in the\ncountry.\n\n1048\n* I was in San Francisco for the quake, and much was made of the fact that fancy downtown hotels opened their doors to\nhouse people needing shelter. It’s worth noting that this generosity was for people made homeless by the quake, not people\nwho were already homeless. For them the earthquake was just another day of scrabbling. The hotels supposedly required a\ncredit card from people, not because they’d be charged for the room, but as evidence that this was the sort of person whose\nhomelessness mattered. This well could have been apocryphal; it’s hard to imagine that the staff at reception needed to see\nsomeone’s plastic to tell the difference.\n\n1049\n* What were the “tightest” countries? Pakistan, Malaysia, India, Singapore, and South Korea. The least tight? Ukraine,\nEstonia, Hungary, Israel, and the Netherlands.\n\n1050\n* As a counter to this, though, people in the tropics also have to foresee annual fluctuations in weather, and no Swede has\never had to plan ahead for the monsoon season.\n\n1051\n* Pinker’s response to the cherry-picking charge is as follows: “Better Angels reports all the published estimates of per capita\nrates of violent death in the archaeological and anthropological literature I could find.” S. Pinker, “Violence: Clarified,” Sci\n338 (2012): 327. If I understand what he is saying accurately, this feels a bit facile. To be facetious, this would be like not\nincluding Quakers in one’s analysis of violence because no one studying them had published something along the lines of\n“Estimated per-capita rates of death in Quaker communities due to gangland-style executions in nightclubs: zero; due to\ntargeted drone missile strikes: zero; due to dirty bombs made with stolen plutonium: zero . . .”\n\ntrip lectures that way, which was probably totally irksome after a while, as he’d have to act all surprised and then pose for\npictures with them. Chagnon was at the center of a firestorm of controversy in 2000 when the journalist Patrick Tierney, in\nhis book Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon, accused Chagnon and a\ncollaborator of causing a genocidal measles epidemic among the Yanomamö, along with other ethical abuses of them as\nresearch subjects. The American Anthropological Association initially condemned Chagnon, which was generally interpreted\nas his being convicted as much for being an abrasive, anti–old boy enfant terrible as for the factuality of the charges.\nEventually both the AAA and independent investigators exonerated Chagnon entirely, showing Tierney’s charges to range\n1053\n* A distinction somehow reminiscent of Charlie the Tuna, back in those TV ads from my youth, being told that StarKist\nwants tuna that taste good, not tuna with good taste.\n\n1054\n* !Kung speak a click language, with the exclamation mark in their name the notation for the click sound. Informally known\nas “Bushmen,” they are part of the larger cultural group of Khoisan San found in Botswana, Namibia, Angola, and South\nAfrica. As orientation, the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy featured the !Kung. Of note, while “!Kung” is the most familiar\nterm most often used for these people, both they and most contemporary anthropologists use the term “Ju/’hoansi” instead.\n\n1055\n* I was raised in an anthropology department that was a major stronghold of !Kung fandom and generalized this to a huge\nfondness for all things African HG (probably in part because they’re all short). A tiny remnant HG tribe alternately called the\nNdorobo or Okiek lives in forests north of the Serengeti in Kenya. They have an oddly symbiotic relationship with the\nneighboring Maasai, emerging from the forest to trade things or to serve a shamanistic role in some Maasai ceremony. They\nare short and silent, dressed in animal skins, and I’ve taken great pleasure in seeing how they unnerve tall, spear-toting\nMaasai. My Maasai friends would make fun of me for how obsessed I was with the Ndorobo.\n\n1056\n* Boehm emphasizes that anthropologists never really know what truly is going on among their research subjects until\nthey’re privy to gossip. In doing my baboon research, I spent many seasons sharing camp with Maasai guys whom I knew\nrelatively well and would hear about big goings-on in their community. Eventually, my soon-to-be wife started joining me in\nthe field, and it was only then that we started to hear about the good stuff, via her becoming friends with some of the women\n—the usual of who was or wasn’t sleeping with whom.\n\n1057\n* We’ll soon see an exception to that, involving the nonreproducing individual helping relatives to reproduce.\n\nignored in the genetics chapter is that most species, including humans, are “diploid,” which means that there are actually two\nsets of chromosomes in each cell, with the same variety of genes. Eggs and sperm are specialized cells, being haploid (i.e.,\ncontaining only a single copy of a chromosome). Put them together, and the egg that is destined to make you you is now\nfertilized (i.e., diploid). Thus you actually have two copies of each gene, one from each parent. (Footnote to a footnote: the\nexception is a specialized collection of genes in mitochondria, which come almost entirely from the mother). If both copies of\nthe gene have sequences that code for identical copies of a protein, the gene is “homozygotic.” If there are two different\nversions, the gene is “heterozygotic.” What sort of trait is specified by the heterozygotic mixing of a gene? Some of the time,\nthe result is a trait that is intermediate between the two possible forms of homozygosity. More often the heterozygotic form\nproduces a trait that is identical to one of the two homozygotic forms. In other words, one of the versions “wins” out over the\nother and is called a “dominant” version of the gene. In contrast, versions of genes that produce a trait only when in the\n1059\n* Poor Wynne-Edwards was actually a major figure in evolution and behavior but, thanks to shallow and superficial people,\nhe is remembered only for having blown it with group selection. I, for example, haven’t a clue what else the guy ever did. His\nfull name was Vero Copner Wynne-Edwards, which probably explains why he’s always called “V. C. Wynne-Edwards,” no\ndoubt even as an infant.\n\n1060\n* The unique feature of the eusocial insect genetic system is that a sterile worker passes on more copies of her genes by\nhelping the queen to reproduce than by reproducing herself. Meanwhile, the eusocial insect world has been shaken up by the\nfact that in some species (e.g., termites) there is a more conventional genetic system in place. People are still sorting that one\nout.\n\n1061\n* Note: No one is claiming that a langur monkey is thinking this through, any more than would be some brine shrimp who\nhas evolved some sort of optimal behavioral reproductive strategy. An animal has the “goal” of “wanting” to pass on copies\nof their genes and thus “decides” to do X. This is just shorthand for saying something like “Over the course of millennia,\nindividuals who do X have passed on copies of their genes at a higher rate, and this has become a common behavioral feature\nof this species.” Animals don’t know about evolutionary biology, just as prototypes of airplane wings in a wind tunnel don’t\nknow about aerodynamics.\n\n1062\n* Or, more correctly, for each gene there’d be a 50 percent chance you’d share the same variant.\n\n1063\n* Also known as “inclusive fitness,” because a gene-based focus includes not only direct reproductive success (Darwinian\nfitness) but also payoffs derived from the success of other relatives, weighted by their degree of relatedness.\n\n1064\n* Note the term used—“invest”—reflecting a quasi-economic orientation to some of the analyses in this field.\n\n1065\n* Such fraternal polyandry occurs in resource-poor regions, basically acting as a means to decrease population growth and\nprevent family plots from winding up being below subsistance level when subdivided and inherited among all the sons in a\nfamily. Instead, all the brothers are married to the one woman, who has equal sexual access to all of them; the brothers\n“believe” that all of them, down to their infant brother, are equally biologically responsible for the children.\n\n1066\n* There is good evidence that inbreeding was responsible for the demise of the Spanish branch of the Habsburg dynasty. G.\nAlvarez et al., “The Role of Inbreeding in the Extinction of a European Royal Dynasty,” PLoS ONE 4 (2009): e5174.\n\n1067\n* Note: not all olfactory kin recognition is based on MHC proteins; there are numerous other sources of an individual\nolfactory signature. Note also how this can explain the kin-selection phenomenon mentioned earlier, where sperm form\ncooperative swimming aggregates only with sperm from the same individual or a close relative. How to pull this off? Use the\nMHC proteins on the surface of the sperm as Velcro—if two sperm have identical proteins (i.e., they’re from the same\nperson), they aggregate very tightly; close relative, not as tightly but still pretty tightly; more distant relative, less tightly, etc.\n\nfights among clientele, nationwide? Yup, you guessed it—Chuck E. Cheese’s, where the fighting is among parents on edge\nabout anything that would detract from the perfection of their child’s birthday party. A particularly common scenario might\nbe where a parent takes exception to some kid hogging a video game and forcefully intervenes to allow their own child to\nplay, leading to an altercation between the parents—Cheney and Seyfarth’s monkeys would have no trouble following that\none. As reported in another journalistic exposé, such incidents can also involve attacks on the Chuck E. Cheese’s mascot,\nincluding a case of a father accusing Chuck of having pinned his boy against a wall, while the mouse said he was just trying\nto squeeze by a crowd of overexcited kids: “The man ripped the mouse’s head off and yelled at him in front of said rowdy\n1069\n* This one is a bit controversial, in that the bat colonies are often made up of somewhat related females, making way for a\nkin-selection argument.\n\nindividual cells join in a structured colony in which about 80 percent of the cells reproduce and the rest play nonreproductive\nsupporting roles. When the colony consists of two different genetic lines of amoebas, there is cooperation in that each line\ncontributes about 20 percent of its cells to the unfun supporting role. Except that lines evolve to try to cheat by sneaking all\ntheir cells into the reproductive pool, and other lines evolve to detect cheaters and refuse to interact with them. For example,\nthe amoebas express a cell-surface protein “adhesion molecule” that lets cells adhere to one another, forming the colony; an\n1071\n* Some years ago a game show called Golden Balls ran in Britain. As the final step in a series of competitions, two\ncompetitors would face each other and play a modified version of the PD. There’d be a pot of money (potentially tens of\nthousands of pounds); each player would have to independently choose either “Split” or “Steal.” If both chose Split, they split\nthe money. If one chose Split and the other Steal, the sucker got zero and the defector got everything. If they both chose Steal,\nthey got nothing. YouTube is full of clips from various episodes, and they’re embarrassingly addictive. Also, see this\nRadiolab analysis of the show: www.youtube.com/watch?\nannotation_id=annotation_1155372699&feature=iv&src_vid=S0qjK3TWZE8&v=zUdBd7BDNu8.\n\nStates is under nuclear attack by the USSR; they are to destroy Moscow. The Americans and Soviets see what is happening,\nand the U.S. military unsuccessfully tries to get the planes to turn back; the Soviets assume the American “Oops, sorry” is a\nruse and prepare an all-out counterattack. The American president (modeled on JFK) tries to show his sincerity and stop the\nattack by sending up fighters to help Soviet jets shoot down the bomber squadron. A few are shot down, but a few get\nthrough, and most of the Soviet brass are still convinced it is a ruse. Finally, as the only means to prevent an all-out nuclear\nexchange, the president does a Tit for Tat, ordering a bomber to drop an equivalent bomb on New York City. Bummer of a\n1073\n* I.e., “Oops, sorry, our bad taking out St. Petersburg. We thought we’d sorted out that bug after that Moscow snafu.”\n\n1074\n* A particularly clever exploitative strategy is called Pavlov. If you’re playing PD, the most advantageous outcomes for you,\nin rank order, are: (a) you defect while the other person is a sucker who cooperates; (b) you both cooperate; (c) you both\ndefect; (d) you’re the sucker who cooperates while the other defects. Pavlov’s basic temperament is to cooperate, but every so\noften, randomly, it defects, and the rule is that, independent of those occasional random actions, if your play resulted in one of\nthe two better outcomes, you do the same thing again next time; if the result was one of the two worse outcomes, you switch\nyour behavior the next time. What that means is that if you are playing against Always Cooperate or a highly forgiving\nversion of Forgiving Tit for Tat, your occasional random defections are either never or rarely punished, allowing you to\nexploit the other player at length.\n\n1075\n* This doesn’t begin to scratch the surface of the weirdness of the naked mole rat. They live underground, have giant incisors\nand no body hair so that they look like saber-toothed sausages, have remarkably little need for oxygen, have next to no pain\nreceptors in their skin, live about ten times longer than other rodents (up to around thirty years), and are remarkably resistant\nto cancer. For this reason the prestigious science journal Nature named the naked mole rat its Vertebrate of the Year a few\nyears ago, which is much cooler and more impressive than making People magazine’s list of the Fifty Most Beautiful People\nin the World.\n\n1076\n* The importance of founder populations was something championed by one of the giants of evolutionary biology, Ernst\nMayr of Harvard; in his view, small founder populations were the driving force for new species forming; it is an extension of\nhis thinking to view transient founder populations as a means to establish cooperation in a larger population. Remarkably,\nMayr published four well-received books when he was over age ninety, the last one (What Makes Biology Unique?) in 2004\nat age one hundred, shortly before his death. Inspirational guy, for a bunch of reasons.\n\n1077\n* Two technical notes. Social monogamy of pair-bonding species doesn’t always translate into sexual monogamy.\n“Tournament” is used by some solely to describe species in which the male-male competition literally takes the form of all\nthe males gathering for competitive displays (as in sage grouse or some ungulate species) but is also used by many, as here, to\nmore broadly describe multimale, multifemale promiscuous mating systems.\n\n1078\n* Goodall, in her chimp fieldwork, reported the case of Flint, the youngest child of the very aged Flo; she never fully weaned\nhim, and he remained highly dependent on her, even into adolescence. When she died of old age, Flint underwent what can\nonly be described as a reactive depression, failing to forage or socially interact; he died a month later.\n\n1079\n* What is an extreme version of such insulin resistance called by doctors? Gestational diabetes. In other words, we’re back to\ndisciplinary buckets—if you’re an OB/GYN, we’re talking about a disease. If you’re an evolutionary biologist, we’re talking\nabout a particularly tumultuous struggle between mom and fetus.\n\n1080\n* This arms race is revealed in two classes of diseases. Normal development represents a balancing of paternally derived\nprogrowth genes and maternally derived ones doing the opposite. What if there is a mutation in a paternally derived\nimprinted gene, removing it from the equation? The counteracting maternal genes, unopposed, greatly inhibit fetal growth,\nand the fetus doesn’t implant. And what if the opposite occurs, with a mutation incapacitating the female gene, leaving the\nprogrowth paternal genes working unopposed? Out-of-control growth of the placenta, resulting in an aggressive cancer,\nchoriocarcinoma.\n\n1081\n* Neuroscientists often use the term “endophenotype,” which basically means “a trait that we used to be unable to detect at\nthe phenotypic level but now can, thanks to some invention, so we’re going to call it an endophenotype, meaning a newly\nobservable trait that is kind of inside you.” Your blood type is an endophenotype, detectable with an assay on a blood sample;\nthe size of your amygdala is an endophenotype, detectable with a brain scanner.\n\n1082\n* By now it should be clear how often thinking about evolution is helped by metaphors and analogies. This prompted a great\nmeta-analogy that everyone attributes to the biologist Steve Jones of University College London: “Evolution is to analogy as\nstatues are to birdshit.”\n\n1083\n* Pääbo, who is a stunningly good scientist, pioneered the sequencing of ancient DNA, being the first to sequence the\ngenomes of mammoths and Neanderthals.\n\n1084\n* A great analysis of this can be found in The Myth of Monogamy (New York: Henry Holt, 2002), by University of\nWashington psychologist David Barash and psychiatrist Judith Lipton.\n\n1085\n* I recently read in the Kenya Daily Nation about a case that takes one’s breath away, in its challenge not just to kin-selection\nthinking but to our notion of what boundaries of inhumanity would never be crossed. In parts of Tanzania there is the\nwidespread belief that the organs of albinos have magical healing powers, and a shocking number of albino individuals are\nmurdered there for that purpose. The story reports on a five-year-old albino girl in neighboring Kenya and the plot to smuggle\nher into Tanzania to sell her to a shaman to be sacrificed for her organs. The plotters? The girl’s stepfather and father.\n\n1086\n* For example, !Kung bushmen from the Kalahari in Botswana, aboriginal Australian groups, Mbuti Pygmies from the\nCongo, northern Canadian Inuits, and Amazonian populations.\n\n1087\n* Related to this was the notion that most of the evolution of behavior was not about dealing with the social complexities of\nfellow species members but about dealing with abiotic (i.e., nonbiological) pressures. In other words, that behavior evolved\nmostly for dealing with the environment, rather than for competing with other individuals. Again, the main implication of that\nfor our purposes is that it would be another way in which the gradualist importance of interindividual competition was less\nthan the sociobiologists thought. This emphasis on the importance of abiotic selective pressures was common among Soviet\nevolutionary biologists, probably reflecting not only the Marxist ideology but also the awful winters.\n\n1088\n* Who says a scientist can’t be the life of the party?\n\n1089\n* Something fascinating about the foxes and Moscow dogs: Both were selected primarily or exclusively for behavioral traits.\nBut along with those traits came changes in appearance: The foxes are cute—shorter snouts, rounder ears and foreheads, curly\ntails, more varied coloration than standard foxes. And the Moscow dogs, exactly the opposite. If you want to domesticate a\nspecies, breed it for arrested development—a dog is basically a baby wolf, interacting with humans as if they’re all Mommy,\nand with the cute baby features. Same with the foxes, and just the opposite with the Moscow dogs. There is evidence that\ndomestication mostly works on genes disproportionately related to brain development.\n\n1090\n* Apparently there has been a brouhaha over the fact that San Marco’s arches don’t quite fit the technical architectural\ndefinition of a spandrel. Whatever.\n\n1091\n* Considerable debate and speculation have gone into the question of whether female orgasm is a spandrel, carried along as\nbaggage by the selection that gave rise to it in males. Enough said; fools rush in. . . .\n\n1092\n* Well, maybe not all that dramatically—someone poured a pitcher of water on his head. But still.\n\n1093\n* This easy picture was complicated by Trivers being a friend and coauthor of Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton.\n\nnature of the attacks was clearly devastating to some of the principals—for example, protestors at Wilson’s talks regularly\nand absurdly chanted about his being a genocidal racist. Those years afforded me the chance to observe some of the players\nup close, to even get to know a few of them slightly, and both camps had roughly equal distributions of terrific, admirable\nrole models and arrogant, insufferable egotists. My favorite story from this period: Many sociobiologists favored a macho,\nhard-edged persona. One day I rushed into the office of one of them, Professor X, holding a new paper I had just read. This\nguy was famed for a sociobiological model about some behavior, and this paper, by his adversary Professor Z, ripped apart\nthe model with page after page of statistical analyses. “Wow, did you see this paper? Whaddya think?” I stupidly asked.\n1095\n* I have no idea what it is that I just wrote. . . .\n\n1096\n* Ditto.\n\n1097\n* Two important points: This intergroup bias effect was demonstrable in males but not females and was most pronounced\nwhen males were looking at pictures of other males. Second, shortly after publication the paper was retracted; apparently a\ndata-coding error called into question some of the findings; however, those described here were unaltered by this error, and I\nthink they are perfectly valid. Out of commendable cautiousness, the authors, all top researchers, retracted the paper.\n\n1098\n* A powerful example of this is seen in the first war of Indian independence, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, of 1857.\nIndian soldiers—sepoys—serving in the British East India Company’s army rebelled when it became known that the bullets\nthey were issued were greased in either tallow, derived from cows, or lard, from pigs—major offenses to the Hindu and\nMuslim soldiers, respectively. Mind you, this was not the British colonial overlords doing something offensive to the core\ncultural values of either group—for example, declaring Allah a false prophet or banning polytheistic worship. Virtually every\nculture on earth has food prohibitions, often pretty arbitrary ones meant to merely signal core values (kosher laws for\nOrthodox Jews, for example, revolve around zoological arcana about whether a species has a cloven hoof) but that eventually\ngain a huge power. Before it was over, the Sepoy Mutiny killed more than 100,000 Indians.\n\n1099\n* Animate too, in ways that no doubt make historical sense, but still. For example, in French the kidney is masculine but the\nbladder feminine; the trachea is feminine, the esophagus masculine.\n\n1100\n* This study, of avid Yankees and Red Sox fans, also showed that this neuroimaging pattern was strongest among individuals\nwho self-reported the highest likelihood of feeling aggressive toward a fan from the other side (after controlling for the\nperson’s general level of aggression).\n\n1101\n* I heard a brutally cynical joke years ago built around the zero-sum notion that anything that is bad for Them is\nautomatically good for Us: So God appears to all the leaders on earth and announces that he is destroying the world because\nof human sinfulness. The American president assembles his cabinet and says, “I have good news and bad news. God exists,\nbut he is going to destroy earth.” The premier of the Soviet Union (this was told during the atheistic days of the USSR) pulls\ntogether his advisers and says, “I have bad news and worse news. God exists, and he’s going to destroy earth.” And the prime\nminister of Israel tells his cabinet, “I have good news and great news. God exists, and he’s going to destroy the Palestinians\nfor us.”\n\n1102\n* These scenarios of members of ethnic, religious, or racial groups eager to publicly punish a shameful in-group member can\ncut both ways—which behavior constitutes acting shamefully? During the 1969 Chicago Seven trial, presided over by a\nJewish judge, Julius Hoffman, the chief provocateur of the defendants, the Jewish Abbie Hoffman (no relation), would insult\nand taunt the judge by yelling, “You are a shanda fur die goyim [Yiddish for “disgrace in front of the gentiles”]. You would\nhave served Hitler better.”\n\n1103\n* This plays out currently with the deep resentment of many in the Muslim American community that they are especially\nobligated to condemn Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and will be under a cloud of suspicion if they do not. “I refuse to\ncondemn, not because I don’t condemn, but . . . because doing so would mean that I agree that I deserve to be asked,” states\nthe Arab American writer Amer Zahr.\n\n1104\n* Examples of “good alien” movies include The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977),\nCocoon (1985), Avatar (2009), and, of course, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Meanwhile, the numerous “bad alien”\nmovies include The Blob (1958), Liquid Sky (1982), Devil Girl from Mars (1954), and, naturally, Alien (1979). The bad/good\nalien ratio is consistent over the decades (in other words, it’s not the case that the 1950s were disproportionately filled with\nscary alien movies so that the directors weren’t called by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and the 1960s filled\nwith good-alien efforts of stoned directors just back from Kathmandu). I thank Katrina Hui, a student research assistant, who\ndid this analysis.\n\n1105\n* Interestingly, research has shown a similar pattern with conspiracy theorists. People who believe that aliens landed in New\nMexico way back when have a higher-than-chance likelihood of also believing that Princess Di was murdered at the behest of\nthe other royals. And just to show how irrational this all is, as long as you don’t ask them about both scenarios too close in\ntime to each other, people who believe that Di was murdered . . . also . . . believe at a higher-than-chance level that she faked\nher own death and is, say, living under an assumed name in Wisconsin.\n\n1106\n* How is such priming done? The subject is given a series of scrambled sentences and has to scramble them. In one group\nmost of the sentences discuss things that tap into the concept of loyalty (“teammates helps Jane her”), while the other group’s\nsentences are about equality (“fairness advocates Chris for”).\n\n1107\n* In a follow-up study, one that, incongruously, I was involved in, similar issues were examined concerning one target\nindividual—Barack Obama—during the 2008 election season. Subjects were presented with swatches of different shades of\nbrown and were asked which most accurately matched Obama’s skin color. Women who viewed him as more white were\nmore likely to vote for him at their time of ovulation; women who viewed him as more black showed the opposite. Of note,\nthese are small effects. Electability is in the eye, and the hormone status, of the beholder.\n\n1108\n* As a historical oddity, Nazi Germany had the strictest laws in the world concerning the humane treatment and euthanizing\nof animals. The dogs went with far less suffering than their owners.\n\n1109\n* Just to subtly hint at what I thought of the debacle.\n\nfavored. I memorized and irritatingly spouted every pointless bit of trivia I could find on them, watched my first (and pretty\nmuch only) football game, which turned out to be the Packers legendarily defeating the Cowboys for the 1967 championship\nwith a fourth-down touchdown from the one-yard line, with sixteen seconds remaining, played in minus-fifteen-degree\nweather. And that’s it. My football obsession faded when I decided that knowing baseball factoids would be more\nadvantageous (this was fortuitous, living in Brooklyn—soon after came the miraculous 1969 championship season for the\nhapless Mets). I’ve never been to a professional football game, can’t tell you anything about the Packers since (I don’t even\nknow if Bart Starr is still their quarterback, but it wouldn’t surprise me one bit if he’s retired by now), basically ignore\nfootball. Yet almost fifty years later, if I happen to hear once every few years that the Packers are having a good or bad\nseason, my mood is briefly influenced by the news; if I see a photograph of people playing football and they include the\nPackers, I’m sure I preferentially look at them versus the other team, am made fleetingly happy by it being them; I felt\nexcited the one time I met someone from Green Bay and, after thirty seconds of chatting pointlessly with them about the\nat its tables. A Silicon Valley newspaper persuaded me, as a primatologist, to tag along with a reporter and do ethological\nobservations of venture capitalist dominance interactions in their natural habitat at Buck’s. We monitored one table with two\nopposing pairs of business guys negotiating something. Each side had a tanned, fit alpha male, presumably the boss; each\nside had a subaltern toady, weighed down with folders and spreadsheets. The toadies interacted with each other constantly,\npushing papers at each other, jabbing fingers in the air, grimacing. The two bosses floated above it, their chairs angled to\nconspicuously ignore each other, their cell phones miraculously ringing each time the other side attempted to talk to them—\nthey’d wave an imperious, dismissive hand at the opponent and take the call. Occasionally, the toadie would ask his boss\nsomething privately and, with a display of Mandarin minimalism, the boss would briefly nod his head and change the course\nof history. Negotiations concluded, seemingly to everyone’s satisfaction, hands were shaken, breakfast was left ritualistically\nuntouched, and everyone departed. The reporter and I scrambled over to the window to observe them in the parking lot.\nAdversarial interactions over with, the Us/Them-ing shifted—the subalterns scurried off to their sensible little Priuses while\nthe two Masters of the Universe remained chatting, each retrieving a tennis racket from his SUV, amiably comparing them,\neach trying out a swing or two with the other’s. At that moment the face of each one’s faithful toady probably wouldn’t have\n1112\n* Such heterogeneity is hard to appreciate in the United States, where most African Americans descend from a few West\nAfrican tribes that constitute 1 to 2 percent of the total tribal variability in Africa. One of the consequences of this, the fact\nthat drugs are now marketed that preferentially target hypertension among African Americans, seemingly reifies the\nbiological race concept but actually tells you more about the biology of descendants of a small subset of West Africans than\nabout race as a whole.\n\n1113\n* This is not always the case, though. Much analysis went into the acquittal of O. J. Simpson by a jury that included eight\nAfrican American women. Would their most pertinent group identification be one of gender—and thus responsive to\nSimpson’s history of domestic violence—or of race—yet another African American man potentially being framed by the\ncriminal justice system? The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n1114\n* The story has a double layer of poignancies. Prior to the war, one of Armistead’s closest friends was Winfield Scott\nHancock, commanding a brigade at the battle . . . on the Union side. The dying Armistead asked after Hancock’s well-being\nand requested that Bingham send his warm greetings to his old friend.\n\n1115\n* The punch line here is how such individuals barely register with us as people—as we’ll see, neuroimaging supports this. A\nrecent finding highlights the opposite concerning the weird American legal notion of “corporate personhood”—when people\ncontemplate the morality of corporate actions, they activate Theory of Mind networks, just as when contemplating the\nmorality of actions of fellow humans.\n\n1116\n* With the reminder that “competence” is used not in the everyday sense where “low competence” would seem pejorative but\nsimply as a measure of agency.\n\n1117\n* With “competence” here not being skill at being rocket scientists but rather the efficacy those people had when they got it\ninto their heads to, say, steal your ancestral lands.\n\n1118\n* In my experience in East Africa, the charge by African men that the “Hindis” (i.e., Indo-Pakistanis, most of whose families\nhave lived in East Africa for generations) are not “real Africans” is often code for “They won’t sleep with us.”\n\n1119\n* Here’s an example of how things, naturally, are more complicated than this simple matrix. Insofar as we view low-\nwarmth/low-competence individuals as dehumanized objects, we objectify them. But “objectify” more frequently denotes\nsexualization of women. In one study men with high degrees of hostile sexism showed less activation of the medial PFC\n(along with other brain regions associated with Theory of Mind and perspective taking) when looking at pictures of women.\nBut only if the pictures were particularly sexualized. And there was a world of difference between how a hostilely sexist male\nviewed a sexually provocative picture of a woman versus a picture of a homeless person. In the words of the authors, the\nstudy shows that “diminished mental state attribution is not unique to targets that people prefer to avoid.”\n\n1120\n* As I write, the Shiite/Sunni dichotomy dominates, producing the profound incongruity of both Iranian and American forces\nbattling ISIS fighters in Iraq. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n\n1121\n* To see how little has changed, see the 2005 documentary A Girl Like Me, by the then seventeen-year-old filmmaker Kiri\nDavis: www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0BxFRu_Sow.\n\n1122\n* Where activation is, I think, an appropriate marker for negative Them-ing.\n\n1123\n* An extensive health psychology literature shows that “poor but happy” is mostly nonsense—poverty gives rise to higher\nrates of major depressive and anxiety disorders, suicide, and stress-related disease. As we’ll see in a later chapter, “poor but\nhonest” has more truth to it.\n\n1124\n* My apologies for how baboon-centric the examples in the coming pages will be; it reflects my thirty-plus years hanging\naround them.\n\n1125\n* Nice evidence that we’re not always just like other animals: Those antihierarchical Buddhists have a text, the Vinaya\nPitaka, that instructs monks to defecate not in the order of seniority but in the order of arrival at the toilet. There is hope for\nthis planet.\n\n1126\n* Implicit in this is the fact these males and females have separate hierarchies. In general, females of the highest-ranking\nfamily can push around the lowest-quartile rankings of males, though males otherwise dominate females.\n\n1127\n* Note: The correlation between neocortex size and group size across primate species probably reflects each trait influencing\nthe other, i.e., coevolution of the two traits. The neuroimaging study shows that a bigger social group can cause interesting\nparts of the brain to expand (in ways having far more to do with the neural plasticity of chapter 5 than with genes and\nevolution).\n\n1128\n* An example of this that I found to be excruciatingly uncomfortable: I used to play in a regular pickup soccer game at\nStanford. I was terrible, which was widely and tolerantly recognized by all. One of the best, most respected players was a\nGuatemalan guy who happened to be a janitor in my building. At soccer he’d call me Robert (on the rare occasion when\nanything I did was relevant to play). And when he came to empty the garbage from my office and lab, no matter how much I\ntried to get him to stop, it would be “Dr. Sapolsky.”\n\n1129\n* Given how unlikely it is that those soon-to-be-dominant individuals with the largest-of-the-large PFC/STCs just happened\nto be placed in the largest groups.\n\n1130\n* Probably to speed things along, using animals that would learn the shock/bar-pressing relationship the fastest.\n\n1131\n* This applies to more global periods of duress as well; it turns out that despite the image of such periods as increasing\npolarization, it is the rare leftist who becomes more implicitly leftist at such times (stay tuned).\n\n1132\n* Interestingly, Haidt does not characterize himself as conservative, although recent interviews suggest that this is shifting.\n\n1133\n* While it is debatable whether McCarthy actually felt threatened (or even believed a word of what he spewed), he certainly\nknew how to exploit others with that tendency.\n\n1134\n* Importantly, while conservatives may be more sensitive to feeling threatened, they’re not necessarily more empathic to\nthreat to someone else—conservatives are more likely to be skeptical about the validity of someone else’s physical pain, more\nlikely to frame it as malingering and dependent manipulation..\n\n1135\n* Negative images included someone eating worms, excrement floating in a toilet, a bloody wound, and an open sore teeming\nwith maggots. Fun.\n\n1136\n* This has even been shown to involve formal transitive logic. Animal A loses a dominance interaction with animal B.\nAnimal A then observes animal B losing a dominance interaction to animal C. Animal A then, on his first encounter with\nanimal C, gives a subordination signal. This has been shown in various primate species, rats, birds, and even fish.\n\n1137\n* The study also showed, with nice ethological logic, that the same conforming did not occur in orangutans, who are solitary\nprimates.\n\n1138\n* Chimp yawning is most readily evoked by watching yawning by another familiar chimp, next-most readily by watching a\nfamiliar human yawning, followed by an unfamiliar human yawning; however, contagious yawning is not evoked by an\nunfamiliar chimp or an unfamiliar primate species (a baboon).\n\n1139\n* I’d love to know what is going on in the heads of chimps when they abandon their alternative method. Are they activating\nthe amygdala, initiating a stress response? What is a chimp’s equivalent of worrying about seeming like a dork?\n\n1140\n* Social identity theory is most associated with the Polish/French/British psychologist Henri Tajfel. As will be seen, Tajfel,\npondering why normal people join the herd in doing awful things, was but one of the many scientists in this field whose lives\nhad been personally scorched by the Holocaust.\n\n1141\n* What, if anything, such mimicry has to do with “mirror neurons” will await the discussion in chapter 14 as to what, if\nanything, mirror neurons have to do with empathy.\n\n1142\n* As a slick part of the design, it wasn’t the actor in the next room doing this emoting. Instead, pressing the shock button of\neach particular intensity triggered the playing of a particular recording of sounds commensurate with that shock intensity.\nThis would standardize the supposed agony of the learner from one subject to the next.\n\n1143\n* E.g., “So, the scientists found that 65 percent of the subjects were willing to shock the learner to death and then eat his\nheart. And in the prison study, get this, 65 percent of the guards also became cannibals. It’s, like, freaky that they got the\nsame number.”\n\n1144\n* Cool real-life coincidence that isn’t coincidental—Milgram and Zimbardo knew each other as classmates in their high\nschool in the Bronx.\n\n1145\n* One study inspired by Milgram was the Hofling hospital experiment, in which nurses, unaware that they were in an\nexperiment, would be ordered by an unknown doctor to give a dangerously high dose of a medication to a patient. Despite\ntheir knowing of the danger, twenty-one out of twenty-two nurses were willing to comply.\n\n1146\n* Ironic Beginning Department: the SPE was funded by the U.S. military, which was interested in making military prisons\nrun better.\n\n1147\n* Remember, these were predominantly psychologically sound college students. In the SPE nearly all of them had indicated\nat the beginning that they would rather be a prisoner than a guard, and a number indicated that they had volunteered in order\nto learn what prison would be like, expecting to be jailed at some point for civil-rights or antiwar activity. And as is often\nunderemphasized in accounts of the SPE, many of the prisoners, as well as the guards, were deeply distressed afterward,\nhaving seen how readily they were broken into passivity.\n\n1148\n* One teacher, for example, became a conscientious objector during Vietnam, prompted by his horror at his behavior in the\nstudy.\n\n1149\n* And reflecting this, Zimbardo’s recent work examines defiance of unjust authority.\n\n1150\n* The authors of the study also included a category of repellent acts that were nevertheless not moral transgressions, once\nagain matched for a sibling involvement—drinking your sibling’s urine, eating your sibling’s scab.\n\n1151\n* And to demonstrate how much this is tapping into the social brains of these kids, this works only if the shapes are\npersonified with eyes.\n\n1152\n* Dogs differed from primates in two interesting ways that make sense, both dogwise and primatewise. Primates would get\npissed and stop working if there was a difference in the quality of the reward (grape versus cucumber); in contrast, dogs\ndidn’t distinguish quality (bread versus sausage), only whether one was rewarded and the other not. Second, while many\nmonkeys refused to accept an eventual reward and would never cooperate again, dogs all eventually came around, after\nenough entreaties to “shake” by the human.\n\n1153\n* But what if the monkey chooses the two-marshmallow option over the marshmallow/celery one because, well, having any\nsort of situation with two marshmallows on the scene was just so much more exciting? The authors did a nice control—when\nthere was no monkey in the adjacent space, the choice would be random as to what food was deposited in the second space.\n\n1154\n* Actually, the trolley problem was invented by the British philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967.\n\n1155\n* And as alluded to earlier, people with vmPFC damage are strongly and equally willing to pull the lever or push the person.\nYou see the same if you give people a benzodiazepine (a tranquilizer like Valium). The vmPFC and amygdala are calmed\ndown (both by direct actions of the drug and secondarily via damping of the sympathetic nervous system), and people are\nmore willing to push.\n\n1156\n* I kind of wish the authors had indicated the name of the bank, just in case I’m ever considering depositing money in a\nSwiss bank and want to be able to immediately check one candidate off my list of possible banks.\n\n1157\n* And recall from the last chapter how Haidt has shown that liberals place more of an emphasis than conservatives do on\nharm and fairness issues, while conservatives disproportionately value loyalty, respect, and purity. Haidt drolly refers to these\nstudies as his “cross-cultural” research, conjuring images of him with pith helmet and mosquito net, trekking through the\nlikes of Berkeley and Provo.\n\n1158\n* Just as an off-the-cuff example, if I were to find myself in the middle of a religious service and suddenly suffer from\nhideously loud, malodorous flatulence, I’d sure hope I was hanging out with Quakers rather than, say, a bunch of the boys\nfrom the Taliban at Friday prayer.\n\n1159\n* Just to bring another term into the mix, most in the field seem to categorize embarrassment as a transient, low-rent version\nof shame. Its regulatory power is shown by the Semai people of the Malay Peninsula, who say, “There is no authority here\nbut embarrassment.”\n\n1160\n* Which, to emphasize something that we all truly know but have trouble remembering, is not synonymous with happiness.\nExtensive research on happiness, ranging from longitudinal studies of the same individuals over time to huge cross-cultural\nstudies of tens of thousands of subjects in dozens of countries, all show the same thing: when people rise out of abject\npoverty, they most definitely tend to become happier. But above the level of struggling to eke out an existence, there is\nremarkably little relationship between income and happiness.\n\nfrom being able to leave work.” This helps, but still there are some parents who are habitually late. So the school institutes a\nsanctions program—each time you’re late, we add a charge to your bill. And the rate of parental tardiness worsens. Why?\nBecause the transgression has been moved from the realm of in-group social intuition (“Hey, I shouldn’t be selfish toward\nmembers of our school community”) to a more calculated realm (“Okay, I’m willing to incur an increased cost for my\nconvenience”). This might also be a way to frame the explanation for why, in that cross-cultural study of small-scale societies\n1162\n* These themes bear a strong resemblance to those of the economics Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, in his best seller,\nThinking, Fast and Slow—rather than framing things in a moral arena, his analysis is of the differing strengths and\nweaknesses of fast intuitive thinking and slow analytical thinking in the realm of economics.\n\n1163\n* Although the neuroscientist Sam Harris, in his book Lying, argues that all lying—even white lies, lies to spare someone’s\nfeelings, lies accomplishing the proverbial heroics of, say, hiding a runaway slave—are wrong.\n\n1164\n* Just to reiterate, starting with those social yeast, deception is not limited to primates. Deception along similar lines to that\nobserved in capuchins has been reported in those brilliant corvid birds; moreover, behaviors such as plover birds feigning\ninjury to lure a predator away from its nest have been interpreted as tactical deception. (“Don’t eat the babies. Look, come\nafter me! I’ve got more meat and I can’t get away because I’m injured.”) Similar deception has also been reported in other\nbirds, some ungulates, and cuttlefish.\n\n1165\n* Prompting two great quotes, one generally attributed to the politician Sam Rayburn (“Son, always tell the truth. Then you’ll\nnever have to remember what you said the last time.”) and the other from eighteenth-century Swiss philosopher Johann\nLavater (“He who is passionate and hasty is generally honest; it is your cool dissembling hypocrite of whom you should be\nbeware.”).\n\n1166\n* As assessed by scores on a subpart of a psychopathy questionnaire or by a history of successfully conning people.\nImportantly, the studies included not only a control group of normal individuals but also a control group of psychopaths who\njust happened not to be compulsive liars.\n\n1167\n* The amygdaloid involvement is probably pertinent to a case report from some French neurologists concerning a man who\nhad a seizure every time he lied during business negotiations. He was found to have a tumor pressing on his amygdala; once\nit was removed, the seizures went away (there was no mention of whether the guy was still lying at work). The authors called\nthis “Pinocchio syndrome.”\n\n1168\n* Or stated another way, the chimps were less susceptible to superstitious behavior than were the humans.\n\n1169\n* They gave up more readily in a difficult task and experienced less pleasure—showing less of a preference for sucrose-\nflavored water.\n\n1170\n* This is determined with a “hot-plate test.” A mouse is placed on a room-temperature hot plate; the temperature of the plate\nis gradually raised. You can tell the instant when the heat first becomes uncomfortable—the mouse lifts a paw (at which point\nthe mouse is removed). What was the plate’s temperature at that point? That’s the mouse’s pain threshold.\n\n1171\n* Reading about these animals experiencing this sure induces an empathic state.\n\n1172\n* “Is associated with”—that’s pretty uninformative. For simplicity, I’ve ignored there being all sorts of subparts to the ACC;\ndepression is associated with increased activation in some and decreased in others. Overall, it fits a picture of ACC\ndysfunction being centrally involved in the suffocating, permeating sadness of depression.\n\n1173\n* With that truly important proviso that this applies only to within-group interactions. When dealing with a Them, as we saw,\noxytocin makes people more hostile and xenophobic.\n\n1174\n* It can be an informative political litmus test to consider whose pain you readily feel (e.g., a fetus versus a homeless person).\n“What it means to be liberal or conservative became ideologically solidified around the problem of [empathy for only certain\ntypes of] pain,” writes one political scientist.\n\n1175\n* For those who care, it’s the premotor cortex, along with the supplementary motor area and primary somatosensory cortex.\n\n1176\n* Back to Keltner’s work—when comparing the wealthy and the poor, guess whose hearts speed up when they’re forced to\npay attention to someone else’s suffering?\n\n1177\n* I am on astonishingly thin ice writing about Buddhist thought, which is why we’re now going to quickly transition to the\nterra firma of considering what neuroscientists have found out about Buddhists.\n\n1178\n* With the hope that the distancing thoughts are along the lines of “This is how I do good,” rather than, say, “I think I’ll have\na chicken salad sandwich for lunch.”\n\n1179\n* A colleague of mine used to sardonically talk about his hope that the spouse of some senator would come down with the\nneurological disease that he studied—then, finally, someone powerful would empathize with sufferers of that disease and\nsteer more grant money in the direction of research.\n\nfor a charitable act—“Uh, hey, when you’re done, could you tell the people at the counter that there is no toilet paper here?”\n“Sure,” answered the anonymous voice, and soon a barista’s hand appeared underneath the toilet stall door offering, if not\nalms for the poor, TP for the stranded. The trick now is how to re-create this scenario with subjects in brain scanners. This\nmay not, in fact, have been the perfect anonymous interaction. While the Good Samaritan who carried my message and I\nwere anonymous to each other, he wasn’t to the baristas. And for all I know, they promptly gave him a free latte or praised\n1181\n* Lest we get carried away with ourselves, there is good evidence that some of the most impressive cave paintings were done\nby Neanderthals rather than humans. But by now, who cares about those silly species designations, what with all the\nhuman/Neanderthal mating now shown to have been going on?\n\n1182\n* Let alone being so much inside said groove as to be grooved yourself, i.e., groovy.\n\n1183\n* Just consider what is inherent in the fact that numerous languages worldwide have grammatical genders, with some nouns\ndesignated as masculine, others as feminine. The cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky has shown how grammatical gender can\ninfluence thought. In one study she showed that German speakers tend to associate the word “bridge” (which is feminine in\nGerman) with attributes such as “beautiful,” “elegant,” or “slender,” while Spanish speakers (for whom “bridge” is\nmasculine) tend toward associations with “big,” “strong,” “towering,” and “sturdy.”\n\n1184\n* Interestingly, harking back to earlier chapters on hierarchy and status, the authors also found that being of lower\nsocioeconomic status predicted a greater degree of moralizing purity, but not moralizing justice or harm avoidance.\n\n1185\n* Which harks back to our confusing goodness with beauty (thus giving lesser jail sentences to those people with symmetrical\nfaces, etc.). As first introduced in chapter 3, we use similar brain circuits, activating the medial orbitofrontal cortex, when\ncontemplating whether an act is moral as when contemplating whether a face is beautiful.\n\n1186\n* Habyarimana’s plane also carried Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Hutu president of neighboring Burundi, an equally small,\nimpoverished nation with the same history of Hutu/Tutsi conflict. It soon had its own ethnic civil war.\n\n1187\n* And continue to. In the aftermath of the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel army’s victory, approximately\ntwo million Rwandan Hutus fled the country, fearing reprisals (of which there have been remarkably few under the\ngovernment of rebel leader Paul Kagame). The massive refugee camps formed in the eastern Congo by the fleeing Hutus\nwere soon under the control of the defeated Hutu militias and became a breeding ground for attacks on Rwanda and the two\nsubsequent Congo wars, which killed millions.\n\n1188\n* I’ve been mighty interested in the history of the Rwandan genocide. I spent time in Rwanda a few years before it occurred,\nlooking at mountain gorillas on its border with the Congo. Predictably, pathetically, stupidly, poignantly, something-ly, I came\naway thinking of the people there as kind and generous. I assume that most everyone I encountered wound up dead, killers,\nand/or refugees. At moments when I wonder why anyone should bother writing a book like this, I taunt myself by thinking,\n“Golly gee, if only I’d teamed up with the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to give some lectures in Rwanda about the\nbiology of pseudospeciation, all of this could have been prevented.”\n\n1189\n* As a sacred-values issue that either does or doesn’t seem ironic, depending on your politics, the authors cite how the\nnewborn State of Israel in 1948, in a terrible economic state, nonetheless refused compensation money from Germany for\nproperty of Jews murdered by the Nazis—until Germany publicly expressed contrition.\n\nIreland, the Catholic president of the Republic of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, sent Paisley and his wife a fiftieth wedding-\nanniversary gift—a wooden bowl. This was rife with meaning, as it was crafted from a tree at the Irish site of the Battle of the\nBoyne, where in 1690 the Protestant William of Orange defeated Catholic James II. That victory was critical to the\nsubsequent centuries of Protestant domination in Ireland, an endless point of pain for Catholics and pride for Protestants (who\nwould commemorate the victory every July 12 with provocative marches through Catholic neighborhoods that usually ended\nin violence). For Ahern to acknowledge the sacred historical significance of the site for Unionists was enormous. Paisley\n1191\n* How did Viljoen and Mandela come to meet secretly on that couch? It was catalyzed by a leading antiapartheid\ntheologian . . . Viljoen’s twin brother Abraham. The two had been long estranged, although the general intervened on more\nthan one occasion to prevent his brother from being assassinated by a right-wing death squad. The twins are teaching tools for\nchapter 8—same genes, radically opposite politics and worldviews. Same genes, and both charismatic leaders who devoted\nand risked their lives for what they viewed as a sacred cause.\n\n1192\n* See the actual event at www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncwee9IAu8I. South Africa’s national anthem is now a hybrid of the\ntwo songs, with some Zulu, Sesotho, and English thrown in for good measure. While its existence is intensely moving, it\nmust be hell on wheels to sing right, modulating all over the place.\n\n1193\n* I’m hugely grateful to Josh Greene and Owen Jones for closely vetting this chapter.\n\n1194\n* Namely keeping dangerous people far away from everyone else—just to get this one out of the way early in the chapter.\n\nmechanics.” Argh. What anyone sensible who has thought about this will point out is that (a) the consequences of the\nsubatomic indeterminacy of quantum mechanics (about which I understand zero) don’t ripple upward enough to influence\nbehavior, and (b) if they did, the result wouldn’t be the freedom to will your behavior. It would be the utter randomization of\nbehavior. In the words of philosopher/neuroscientist Sam Harris, a free will trasher, if quantum mechanics actually played a\nrole in any of this, “Every thought and action would seem to merit the statement ‘I don’t know what came over me.’” Except\n1196\n* And just to show what a bleeding heart everyone thought Weyer was, his book was banned by both the Catholic Church\nand leading Reformation clergy.\n\n1197\n* I thank an excellent undergrad, Tom McFadden (now a superb biology teacher at my kids’ school!), for background\nresearch on M’Naghten.\n\n1198\n* I just love the use of the word “reform” in this context.\n\n1199\n* And I mean truly thinking that way, rather than backing into it because the alternative view would demand overwhelming\nchanges in how society works.\n\n1200\n* I’m obviously confused by Gazzaniga’s stance, and I suspect his conclusions reflect his attempts to reconcile his worldview\nas a neuroscientist with his being a religious man, something he discusses in his memoir, Tales from Both Sides of the Brain:\nA Life in Neuroscience (New York: Ecco, 2016).\n\n1201\n* Many chapters ago I made reference to the “Son of Sam” murder spree in 1976 and the arrest of David Berkowitz. In his\ndefense Berkowitz claimed that he was demonically possessed and had been commanded to murder—not by Satan, Hitler, Al\nCapone, or Genghis Khan but, instead, by . . . his neighbor’s dog. He was convicted and given six consecutive life sentences.\n\n1202\n* And also a very nice guy. Along with a Stanford colleague, law professor and bioethicist Hank Greely, I once got to debate\nagainst Morse and a colleague at a law school. It was both really fun, because Morse is insanely smart, and really terrifying,\nbecause he’s insanely smart.\n\n1203\n* Because cross-cultural psychiatry research shows that in individualist cultures, when depressed people talk to a friend for\nrelief, they’re likely to talk about their problems, whereas in collectivist cultures they’re likely to ask about the friend’s\nproblems.\n\n1204\n* Just to give a sense of how few baby steps we’ve taken, the maximal number of contributing variables identified in\npredicting depression is serotonin transporter status + childhood adversity status + adult social support status. That’s it, that’s\nabout how far the literature has gotten. For frontal damage and antisocial violence, it’s neurological status of frontal cortex +\nD4 dopamine receptor subtype + ADHD status.\n\n1205\n* I thank an excellent student, Katrina Hui, for bringing my attention to Malleus Maleficarum.\n\n1206\n* I specify “in the West” because this is by no means a universal interpretation even today.\n\n1207\n* Cars may soon be entering discussions of moral decision making—when having to do one or the other, should a self-\ndriving car smash itself into a wall, killing the passenger, in order to save five pedestrians? Most people think that is how\nsuch cars should be programmed but, predictably, would prefer that one that they used make the opposite choice. Perhaps\nmore expensive models will work that way, while the hoi polloi have more utilitarian cars. Or maybe the car will decide,\nbased on how frequently you clean it and change its oil.\n\n1208\n* The full list (figures in deaths per year, approximate): (1) World War II, 11 million; (2) An Lushan Rebellion, 4.5 million;\n(3) World War I, 3 million; (4) and (5) Taiping Rebellion and Tamerlane, each 2.8 million; (6) fall of the Ming dynasty, 2.5\nmillion; (7) and (8) Mongol conquests and Rwandan genocide, each 2.4 million; (9) Russian Civil War, 1.8 million; (10)\nRussia’s sixteenth/seventeenth-century Time of Troubles, 1.5 million; (11) Mao-induced Chinese famines, 1.4 million.\n\n1209\n* This has always been the classic interpretation of Friedman’s idea. It’s quite possible, however, that people don’t go to war\nin those circumstances because they’re too busy going to the doctor for their adult-onset diabetes.\n\n1210\n* An exception is Lawrence Keeley of chapter 9, who argued that the net result of trade, with its inevitable disagreements, is\nmore, rather than less, intergroup tension.\n\n1211\n* To be fair, Richard Nixon was raised as an Evangelical Quaker; they are not pacifists.\n\n1212\n* Although it is fascinating that over the last century, while Scandinavian countries developed their enlightened and far-\nreaching system of governmental support of people’s social needs, religiosity there plummeted dramatically; today only a\nsmall minority of Scandinavians are devoutly religious. So religiosity may not be as robust in the future as one would think,\nand as we saw in chapter 9, as secular institutions become better at caring for people’s needs, religiosity declines. Probably\nmore important, this is a good demonstration that religion sure isn’t the only route for highly inclusive in-group prosociality.\n\n1213\n* Another limitation of the approach is that by definition there is self-selection for participants willing to entertain the\npossibility of détente with Thems. Moreover, participants often come from privileged socioeconomic backgrounds, limiting\ntheir ability to go and transform the masses afterward.\n\n1214\n* The British eventually crushed the rebellion, at the cost of approximately 150 British lives and 10,000 to 20,000 Kikuyu\nlives, and then handed over power to handpicked, über-Westernized Kenyans rather than Mau Mau guerrilla fighters; as a\nmeasure of how successful the Anglicized handoff was, more than fifty years later, black Kenyan judges still wear powdered\nwigs when presiding.\n\n1215\n* I thank a really excellent undergrad, Dawn Maxey, for her research assistance regarding TRCs and for the bulk of these\ninsights.\n\n1216\n* And, it should be noted, there’s enormous controversy as to what percentage of kills are accidents, collateral damage to\ninnocent bystanders; estimates range from 2 to 20 percent.\n\n1217\n* Yes, yes, I know this isn’t necessarily everyone’s list, but the point is the singularity, rather than the specifics of their acts.\n\n1218\n* Two who participated in the killings eventually committed suicide. One, Lieutenant Stephen Brooks, did so for unknown\nreasons while in Vietnam. The other, PFC Varnado Simpson, did so years later, after, among other things, seeing his ten-year-\nold son killed by a stray bullet fired by neighborhood teens. He said, “He died in my arms. And when I looked at him, his\nface was like the same face of the child that I had killed. And I said: This is the punishment for killing the people that I\nkilled.” He suffered from severe PTSD, sequestered himself in his home with windows shuttered for years, and succeeded on\nhis third suicide attempt.\n\nwho sent word of the events further up the chain. As a result, the senior officer who had commanded the search-and-destroy\nmission canceled the ones planned for subsequent days in neighboring villages and began the process of covering up what\nhad occurred. Andreotta was dead within three weeks, killed in battle. Colburn and, even more so, Thompson, attempted to\ninform every military, governmental, and media source available about the events and played key roles in making the My Lai\nMassacre public. Representative Mendel Rivers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, attempted to block the\nprosecution of Calley and to have Thompson prosecuted instead as a traitor; Thompson testified against Calley at his trial and\n1220\n* I thank two great undergrads, Elena Bridgers and Wyatt Hong, for help with the research throughout this section.\n\n1221\n* Which, among other things, is why the nervous system is so vulnerable to injury. Someone has a cardiac arrest. Their heart\nstops for a few minutes before it is shocked into beating again, and during those few minutes the entire body is deprived of\nblood, of oxygen and glucose. And at the end of those few minutes of “hypoxia-ischemia,” every cell in the body is miserable\nand queasy. Yet it is preferentially brain cells (and a consistent subset of them) that are now destined to die over the next few\ndays.\n\n1222\n* For chemists, in other words, the distribution of charged ions inside and out balance each other.\n\n1223\n* Jargon: that little bit of “depolarization.”\n\n1224\n* Ironic footnote: Cajal was the chief exponent of the neuron doctrine. And the leading voice in favor of synctitiums? Golgi;\nthe technique he invented showed that he was wrong. He apparently moped the entire way to Stockholm to receive his Nobel\nPrize in 1906—shared with Cajal. The two loathed each other, didn’t even speak. In his Nobel address, Cajal managed to\nmuster the good manners to praise Golgi. Golgi, in his, attacked Cajal and the neuron doctrine. Jerk.\n\n1225\n* More with the keys in locks—the reuptake pumps have a shape that is complementary to the shape of the neurotransmitter,\nso that the latter is the only thing taken back up into the axon terminal.\n\n1226\n* What that also implies is that if a neuron is getting axonal projections to five thousand of its spines from a neurotransmitter\nA–releasing neuron and five thousand from a neurotransmitter B–releasing one, it expresses different receptors on those two\npopulations of its spines.\n\n1227\n* This makes sense only after introducing an additional fact. Thanks to random, probabilistic hiccups in the ion channels now\nand then, neurons will occasionally have a random, spontaneous action potential from out of nowhere. So neuron A\nintentionally fires off ten action potentials, followed soon after by two random ones. That might make it hard to tell if neuron\nA meant to yell ten, eleven, or twelve times. By calibrating the circuit so that the inhibitory feedback signal shows up right\nafter the tenth action potential, the two random ones afterward are prevented, and it is easier to tell what neuron A meant. The\nsignal has been sharpened by damping the noise.\n\n1228\n* Thanks to the wisdom of Dale, we know that the same neurotransmitter(s) is coming out of every axon terminal of neuron\nC. In other words, the same neurotransmitter can be excitatory at some synapses and inhibitory at others. This is determined\nby what type of ion channel the receptor is coupled to in the dendritic spine.\n\n1229\n* Similar circuitry is also seen in the olfactory system, which has always puzzled me. What’s just to the side of the smell of\nan orange? A tangerine?\n\n1230\n* As an aside, there has been incredibly interesting work concerning emergent properties of the brain that helps explain how\nthe different regions wire up in the developing brain in an optimal way that minimizes the amount (and thus “cost”) of axonal\nprojections needed. For aficionados, the things the developing brain does bear some resemblance to some approaches used\nfor the Traveling Salesman Problem.\n\n1231\n* An implication of these definitions is that the same molecule can serve as either a neurotransmitter or a hormone in\ndifferent parts of the body. Also (minutia warning), sometimes hormones have “paracrine” effects, influencing cells in the\ngland in which they were secreted.\n\n1232\n* Just to make sure we have this sorted out, here’s a second example, namely the hypothalamic/pituitary/ovarian axis: the\nhypothalamus releases GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), which triggers the pituitary to release LH (luteinizing\nhormone), which triggers the ovaries to release estrogen.\n\n1233\n* And just to head off a potential misunderstanding at the pass, a zillionth of a percent of the cholesterol in your body is used\nfor hormone synthesis, so changes in levels of cholesterol in the diet won’t impact the amount of such steroids made—the\nbody synthesizes enough cholesterol on its own for steroid synthesis.\n\n1234\n* Actually typically more than one, but let’s not go there.\n\n1235\n* Naturally, the picture is more complicated than this, as is the case for most everything in this primer. Not all enzymes are\nmade of proteins.\n\n1236\n* And as a clarification, there are millions of copies of a particular hormone molecule (e.g., insulin) in the circulation, all\nsharing that same shape.\n\n1237\n* Actually, I haven’t a clue how many atoms there are in the universe, but you’re required to say stuff like this.\n\n1238\n* The names of which I’m omitting, to avoid inundating the newcomer.\n\n1239\n* The central dogma of “information flows from DNA to RNA to protein” can be wrong. There are circumstances where\nRNA can determine the sequence of DNA. This has lots to do with how some viruses work but isn’t relevant to us. Another\nbit of revisionism, one that garnered two Nobel Prizes in 2006, is that a huge percentage of RNA does not then specify the\nconstruction of some protein. Instead it can target and destroy other sequences of RNA, a phenomenon known as “RNA\ninterference.” Still other RNAs are created simply to render some segments of DNA itself “unreadable.”\n\n1240\n* There are other, rarer types of mutations. One class of them, for example, involves the codon coding for an amino acid\ncalled glutamine being repeated over and over in the gene, even dozens of times, producing what are called “polyglutamine\nexpansion diseases,” the most famous being Huntington’s disease. They are extremely rare mutations, though.\n\n1241\n* As do a parent and child, while half siblings share 25 percent of their genes, as do grandparents and grandchildren, and so\non.\n\n1242\n\n1243\nWhat’s next on\nyour reading list?\nDiscover your next\ngreat read!\nGet personalized book picks and up-to-date news about this author.\nSign up now.\n\n1\nTitle Page\n2\nCopyright\n3\nDedication\n4\nContents\n5\nINTRODUCTION\n7\nOne: THE BEHAVIOR\n20\nTwo: ONE SECOND BEFORE\n25\nThree: SECONDS TO MINUTES BEFORE\n82\nFour: HOURS TO DAYS BEFORE\n98\nFive: DAYS TO MONTHS BEFORE\n134\nSix: ADOLESCENCE; OR, DUDE, WHERE’S MY\nFRONTAL CORTEX?\n151\nSeven: BACK TO THE CRIB, BACK TO THE\nWOMB\n172\nEight: BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE JUST A\nFERTILIZED EGG\n225\nNine: CENTURIES TO MILLENNIA BEFORE\n265\nTen: THE EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR\n330\nEleven: US VERSUS THEM\n390\nTwelve: HIERARCHY, OBEDIENCE, AND\nRESISTANCE\n427\nThirteen: MORALITY AND DOING THE RIGHT\nTHING, ONCE YOU’VE FIGURED OUT WHAT\nTHAT IS\n477\nFourteen: FEELING SOMEONE’S PAIN,\nUNDERSTANDING SOMEONE’S PAIN,\nSixteen: BIOLOGY, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE\nSYSTEM, AND (OH, WHY NOT?)
